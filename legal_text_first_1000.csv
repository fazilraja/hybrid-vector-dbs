Case13600,cited,Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1,"Before turning to consider each of the grounds of review, it must be noted that, to a significant extent, the Applicant's written and oral submissions proceeded, or at least appeared to proceed, on the premise that the Court's task involved a reconsideration of the merits of the decision. That premise is not correct. As was said by Brennan J in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35-36: The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository's power. If, in so doing, the court avoids administrative injustice or error, so be it; but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error. The merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone. 11 It is not disputed that the factors the Respondent was required to take into account were affected by the proper construction of reg 20.3(3)(a). The issue was whether the Respondent's construction of reg 20.3(3) (see [6] above) was the proper construction. In my view, subject to one exception which did not affect the Applicant adversely, it was the proper construction. 12 The Respondent concluded that reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii) refers to employment in a company or firm in which an employee undertakes patent work for that company or firm and does not extend to include experience in a law firm undertaken on behalf of client companies or firms. Again, subject to one issue which does not affect the outcome of the current application, the Respondent's construction was consistent with the express words of the 1990 Patents Act and the Regulations. 44 The Applicant nevertheless submitted that if that was the object of the legislation and the Regulations, then the regulation is both over and under-inclusive. It is over-inclusive in the Applicant's submission because a person who is employed as a technical assistant for one year but spends the whole year making photocopies will nevertheless qualify for registration even though he or she has gained no experience with patent specifications. It is under-inclusive because a person who has spent a year drafting patent specifications under the supervision of a registered practitioner outside a traditional patent practice or a corporate context (eg at a university legal department) may not qualify for registration. (Whether the Respondent would or should consider a university legal department under those circumstances as a ""patent attorney's practice"" within the meaning of reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) is an interesting question.) These criticisms, though not without force, do not advance the Applicant's case. Every system of rules-based credentialing, and every bright-line rule generally, suffers from the same flaws: no doubt there are many articled clerks who spend two years in a conference room reviewing documents and never learn to draft a pleading or a contract; and, no doubt, there are many 17 year-olds who are mature enough to vote (and some 19 year-olds who are not). Despite these drawbacks, bright-line rules are preferred over case-by-case decision-making in many instances because it is judged by the rule-making authority where the advantages in administrative efficiency, transparency, and certainty outweigh the disadvantages of over and under-inclusiveness. Ultimately, the Applicant's case boils down to the complaint that the Regulations are unfair and ought to be redrawn. However, the rule the Applicant seeks, whereby an Australian legal practitioner, having provided patent advice for the requisite period, is exempted from having to obtain further work experience in order to become a registered patent attorney, is a matter for government to provide for, not the courts. While the rejection of his application by the Respondent may seem unjust to the Applicant, it must be remembered in considering an application for judicial review that ""the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice"": Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 36. 45 For the foregoing reasons, the Applicant's construction point fails."

As Pearlman CJ observed in Darling Casino at 207, if the power was improperly exercised, the instrument is invalid in its totality. It is no answer that part of it could have been validly made."
Case3057,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Company Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329,"The declarations, proposed by the parties, and made by the Court, identify the relevant conduct and declare that it involved contraventions of the Act .

Case10395,followed,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 , 206 CLR 323","Having considered the evidence and the submissions advanced, and extended to the Applicant a "" reasonable opportunity "" to present his case, the remaining task of the Tribunal was that set forth in s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , namely to make its findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence upon which those findings were based. That sub-section provides as follows: Where the Tribunal gives in writing the reasons for its decision, those reasons shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. This provision does not require the Tribunal to set forth all findings of fact, but only those findings on "" material questions of fact "": cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 at [67] [68], [2001] HCA 30 ; 206 CLR 323 at 345 6. A more focussed submission in respect to hardship may have led the Tribunal to make a further finding. But the failure to make such a possible further finding does not expose reviewable error on the part of the Tribunal. 36 When determining whether the reasons for decision of the Tribunal have adequately dealt with the particular legal and factual issues which were advanced before it, the Court must take into account a variety of factors. These include the comparative importance (or lack of importance) of any particular submission being advanced for determination and whether the evidence being presented raises any issue in need of resolution (even if not expressly the subject of a submission, especially in the case of an unrepresented party). In the present proceeding, and in accordance with Direction No 21, the Tribunal gave consideration to those matters which the Minister and the Government "" directed "" should be given "" particular importance "" and those matters which it directed should be given "" less individual weight "". Relevantly, "" hardship "" to a party whose visa was cancelled was not a matter specifically addressed by the Direction. 42 Similarly, in Vu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 12 , 101 ALD 454 Tamberlin J concluded: [13] The second submission involved the assumption, as his Honour pointed out, that it was a relevant fact for the minister to consider whether Mr Vu could receive medical treatment, in particular methadone treatment, for his heroin addiction if he goes back to Vietnam. His Honour found that the minister was aware of that fact and took it into account when making her decision. We have grave doubts that any of the particular matters of hardship identified by Mr Vu, even if not taken into account by the minister, would show jurisdictional error in her decision. The minister clearly addressed both the issue of hardship generally and each of the topics to which the direction issued under s 499(1) of the Act required the decision-maker to consider when exercising discretion. The particular matters of hardship raised by Mr Vu are not matters which, either expressly or by necessary implication from s 501 of the Act, required the minister to have regard to each of them: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1981) 162 CLR 24 ; 66 ALR 299 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 323 ; 180 ALR 1 ; 62 ALD 225 ; [2001] HCA 30.

Case6431,cited,Elliott v Nanda and Another [2001] FCA 418 ; (2001) 111 FCR 240,"Under s 105 of the SDA a person who causes, instructs, aids or permits another person to do an act that is unlawful under Division 1 or 2 of Part II shall, for the purposes of the SDA, be taken also to have done the act. The meaning of the word 'permit' was discussed in Cooper v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Another [1999] FCA 180 ; (1999) 93 FCR 481 at 494-495, [41] - [45] . Moore J in Elliott v Nanda and Another [2001] FCA 418 ; (2001) 111 FCR 240 at 293, [163] explained the operation of s 105 as pertaining to the situation where a person who is in a position to prevent allegedly unlawful conduct fails to do so. His Honour said: 'Section 105 provides a means of bringing about lawful conduct by rendering liable a person who could prevent unlawful conduct from occurring or continuing or who assists, directly or indirectly, in its performance. A person can prevent unlawful conduct by not creating a situation where it will or may take place or altering a situation so it will not continue.'"
Case15788,cited,WAKM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 730,"The principles which apply in this situation are not in doubt. In Kovalev v Minister for Immigration [1999] FCA 557 ; (2000) 100 FCR 323 ("" Kovalev "") at 326-328, French J explained the relevant principles: ""In making a consent order the Court exercises judicial power. This is a power conferred upon it by the Parliament under Ch III of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Its exercise is a public function and operates to bind the parties. Its public character applies to agreed orders disposing of private litigation between citizens or corporations and proceedings brought by or against governments and their agencies or public authorities. An order disposing of proceedings by consent must be self-explanatory as must any order. It is not appropriate to make an order of uncertain content or the content of which is to be derived from materials which are not on the public record. There is a fundamental difficulty where a court makes an order remitting a matter to a decision-maker or tribunal to be decided 'according to law' and the court itself is not informed of the nature of the error conceded. The court is then making an order without being apprised of its basis and proposed operation. To do so in my opinion is a purported, but not an actual exercise of judicial power. Moreover, in a practical sense the decision-maker or tribunal lacks the benefit of any binding direction from the court as to precisely what it is that the decision-maker or tribunal is required to do. In the present case the precise concession which led to the proposed consent order had not been communicated by the respondent to the applicant. The possibility arose that the matter could have been remitted to the Tribunal with the parties themselves not being ad idem as to the error of law which had led to the decision being set aside and which the Tribunal was required to rectify. And even if there had been such an agreement the terms of the order proposed would not have disclosed to the public what the parties had agreed should be its content. In the particular case where a tribunal decision is set aside, the Tribunal itself is not usually a party and has played no role in the negotiation of the agreement that it erred in law. A fortiori in that case the order must be clear and complete and the Court must be satisfied that it is appropriate. ... ... It is well-established that in making a consent order or indeed in accepting undertakings the Court must have regard to the limits of its power. The parties cannot, by consent, confer power on the Court to make orders which the Court lacks power to make Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission ( 1981 ) [1981] HCA 48 ; 148 CLR 150 at 163. The question whether a consent order is to be made, is not concluded by a finding that it is formally within the power of the Court. In the exercise of its power the Court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute (WA) Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 at 86 and the authorities referred to there. It is important therefore that the Court itself addresses and is satisfied of the basis upon which its order is to be made and in particular where the order sets aside the decision of an official decision-maker or a tribunal. ... ... In the case of error of law attributed to a decision-maker or tribunal there is a particular public interest which requires the Court's specification of the error and its satisfaction that error occurred. It is also a substantial discourtesy for a court to overturn the decision of an official decision-maker and a fortiori that of a statutory tribunal without consideration of the error that leads to the decision being overturned or communication of the terms of that error to the decision-maker or tribunal. If such a determination is to be set aside on the basis that it has failed to apply or has misapplied the law whether substantive or procedural, there may potentially be some precedential impact in other like cases. To permit the principle underlying the order to be formulated only by the parties in their submissions to the decision-maker or the Tribunal leaves the content of that principle in the hands of the parties."" As French J noted, Sackville J had adopted a similar approach in Sanchez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 265. Subsequently, Stone J in Yulianti v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 142 agreed with the views expressed by French J and Sackville J. Her Honour observed in addition that the grounds for the making of the order can appear in the Court's reasons for judgment, rather than in the order itself. Similar views were expressed by RD Nicholson J in Xiao v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 459 ; (2001) 109 FCR 129. The principles explained by French J in Kovalev have been approved numerous times: see Re Allan and Repatriation Commission (2003) 77 ALD 140 at 144-145 [12]-[14]; Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 132 FCR 93 at 110 [55] - [56] ; and WAKM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 730 at [5] ."
Case24288,referred to,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Stone [2005] HCA 21 ; (2005) 222 CLR 289,"As the joint judgment observed in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Stone [2005] HCA 21 ; (2005) 222 CLR 289 , at 294 [8], the reference to ' income according to ordinary concepts ' in s 6 -5(1) of the ITAA is evidently to Sir Frederick Jordan's statement in Scott v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 , at 219, as follows: 'The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what forms of receipts are comprehended within it, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts.'"
Case4363,applied,Bank of Australasia v Hall [1907] HCA 78 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1514,"cash flow test is not simply an assessment of the bankrupt's debts due and cash available to pay them on one day fixed in time, but involves a forward looking assessment of the bankrupt's ability to pay his debts as and when they fall due in the not distant future. Debts are not simply ""debts 'then' payable, but...debts 'as they become due' &#8212; a phrase which looks to the future"" (Griffiths CJ in Bank of Australasia v Hall [1907] HCA 78 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1514 at 1527). The identification of the bankrupt's contingent and prospective liabilities as at 10 April 2002 and the extent to which they may be considered as part of his debts, at that time, is a crucial matter for determination. The weight of authority suggests that contingent or prospective liabilities may be included as part of a person's debts provided that there is a real likelihood of them being established."
Case1771,cited,Tilmouth v Northern Territory [2001] FCA 820 ; (2001) 109 FCR 240,"the authorisation requirement of s 61(1) is not complied with, the non-compliance is fatal to the success of the application: Moran v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [1999] FCA 1637 at [48] ; Strickland at [56]-[57] (approved in WA v Strickland at [77]-[78]); Drury v Western Australia [2000] FCA 132 ; (2000) 97 FCR 169 at [10] ; Daniel v Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278 (FCA) at [11]; De Rose FCA/O'Loughlin J at [933]. Authorisation must be by all the persons who constitute the native title claim group in respect of the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed: Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [30] ; Dieri People v South Australia [2003] FCA 187 ; (2003) 127 FCR 364 at [55] (' Dieri People '); Tilmouth v Northern Territory [2001] FCA 820 ; (2001) 109 FCR 240 (' Tilmouth '). The Commonwealth submits that irrespective of whether the combined Maduwongga application is an amendment or is a new application, authorisation of the present Maduwongga application on behalf of the Strickland/Nudding group by the original Maduwongga Claim group is still required. The Commonwealth relies on Tilmouth . Ms Tilmouth's application concerned three separate parcels of land, all of which were within or close to the area covered by an application for a determination of native title on behalf of the Larrakia people that was already pending in the Court. Ms Tilmouth was a dissident claimant within that group. Ms Tilmouth made her application on behalf of the Yirra Bandoo, an acknowledged sub-group of the Larrakia people, in competition with that of the Larrakia people. Her application was in respect of Larrakia land in relation to which the Yirra Bandoo had a special interest. O'Loughlin J concluded that Ms Tilmouth's application was incompetent. His Honour relied, not upon any provisions of the NTA or of the FCRs, but on the concept of community defined in certain passages from Mabo (No 2) at 61, and Ward FCAFC at 371-2. In the passage from Mabo (No 2) , Brennan J stated: so long as the people remain an identifiable community, the members of whom are identified by one another as members of that community living under its laws and customs, the communal native title survives to be enjoyed by the members according to the rights and interests to which they are respectively entitled under traditionally based laws and customs, as currently acknowledged and observed.' O'Loughlin J took his Honour's remarks to indicate that 'community is a composite whole as distinct from subgroups of subsets or clans or divisions within that larger community...' (at 241). He considered that Brennan J's idea of 'community' and 'communal' had also been emphasised by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in Ward FCAFC at [201] and [204]. O'Loughlin J concluded (at 242) from these passages that the smaller group (the Yirra Bandoo) could not make an application for native title. The circumstances of the present case differ from those in Tilmouth . In that case, the application on behalf of the larger group remained on foot, whereas the Strickland/Nudding group's claim has supplanted that of the Maduwongga people. If the original Maduwongga Claim group actually held the particular native title claimed, its authorisation of the present Maduwongga application (on behalf of the Strickland/Nudding group) would be required by the terms of s 61(1). But I am addressing the present question on the hypothesis that the Maduwongga application has not yet been heard and determined, and that it is not yet known who, if anyone, actually holds the common or group rights constituting the particular native title claimed. In these hypothetical circumstances, s 61(1) does not, in terms, require that the making of the application on behalf of the Strickland/Nudding group be authorised by the original Maduwongga Claim group. Nor do I see any reason why it should be assumed against the Maduwongga applicants for the purpose, that the members of the original Maduwongga Claim group hold the particular native title claimed. The Maduwongga applicants are not pursuing the present application on behalf of that larger group, but on behalf of the smaller Strickland/Nudding group."
Case12123,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 353 ; (2004) ATPR 41-996,"The ACCC says its pleading exhibits none of these contended failings. It says the pleading of the contravention of s 45 in reliance upon s 45A is in truth a simple and straightforward matter. It says the adoption of a definitional device does not assume any or a collection of matters but rather asserts as facts that the content of terms are comprehended by the elements of the definition. The subsequent use of those terms in the pleading, although they encapsulate more than one element, makes the contention of contravening conduct plain and clear. As to the obfuscation of the services and whether they are the same, similar or substitutable services provided in competition in a market between ANZ and the relevant participant, the ACCC says that because it relies upon ss 45(2)(a)(ii) and 45 (2)(b)(ii) in conjunction with s 45A , it is simply not necessary to plead all of the various layered onion rings of contestable conduct within the relevant market. What is necessary is to plead, at the centre, whether ANZ and the relevant participant are engaged in an identified market in the provision of identified services in competition. Whether others are in competition with those participants and isolating the composition and characteristics of the outer ring of contestable substitution is neither here nor there nor relevant. Pleading the full structural elements of the market and the boundaries of substitution is thus not required in order to establish the cause of action. Such a proposition is said to be supported by the observations of Heerey J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1997) ATPR 41-570 at 43, 920 and consistent with Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 353 ; (2004) ATPR 41-996 per Selway J at 48, 671. 46 Similarly, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (supra) Selway J at 48, 671 noted the precise limitations in the scope of the conduct alleged in that case. The conduct concerned a contended arrangement in relation to a tender price for a specific contract to be let by the Department of Defence arising out of the tender process. The ACCC relied upon s 45A of the Act . Selway J noted: [It] relates only to the price of a particular contract let by the Department of Defence and particularised in the statement of claim. The competitors involved in that tender process are specified by name in the statement of claim. So too are those said to be parties to the arrangement or understanding. The price said to be fixed has not been particularised, but is either the price contained in the offer by the fifth respondent (which seems to be the case that the ACCC intends to put) or the price obtained by the Department of Defence. Plainly enough, it is not the price of services generally available in the marketplace. 47 His Honour also noted at 48, 671: ... If the allegation related to the effect of an agreement or understanding on the overall operation of the market then it may be necessary for the ACCC to provide quite detailed particulars of that market in order to identify the relevant effect. However, in this case the relevant anti-competitive purpose or effect is strictly limited in scope. 48 Because the conduct involved a quite specific price fixing allegation between particular parties in respect of a particular tender (and consequential contract) let by the Department of Defence in respect of the supply and acquisition of construction services, his Honour concluded that the pleading of those elements, that is, the market, the contract, the participants, the identical services in the context of that transactional arrangement, did not require any greater or more detailed pleading of the market. However, the issue was not whether the applicant was required to plead material facts going to the market for the services and competition between the participants to the contract, arrangement or understanding in respect of those services but whether the material facts pleaded by the statement of claim, in the context of the transaction in question, adequately put the respondent on notice of the case to be met. His Honour concluded that it did. Again, there was no controversy that the service in question was precisely the same service provided in an uncontroversial market for the provision of construction services and the conduct related to a single party, the Department of Defence, in respect of a particular tender transaction. With respect, his Honour was plainly correct in concluding that it was not necessary to plead the market in any broader sense. 49 In simple terms, there is no great leap of pleading faith in either of these cases that the participants to the arrangement containing the s 45A provision were in competition in the supply of the relevant service in a market. 50 The distinction between these authorities and the present case is that here, the very question in controversy, is whether there is a separate market or markets as asserted in which close competition between MRPL and ANZ takes place. The pleader can not simply say there is such a market unless that contention is made good as a logical conclusion drawing together and drawn from material facts that plead the subsistence of the contended markets and contestable participation by MRPL and ANZ in each market. That is not to say that a pedantic or prolix and detailed pleading of the boundary of the entire field of rivalry need be scoped in the pleading or that the outer boundary of contestability between all participants in the market need be framed. It is however important to start at the centre and work outwards by identifying the services which are the subject of one or more markets, the core or emblematic participants in the contended markets for those services (i.e., the core or essential suppliers of the identified services; and the class of acquirers of the service (potential residential home loan borrowers seeking the relevant related services)), the services in fact provided by MRPL and those services in fact supplied by ANZ and the material facts which demonstrate that those services are strong substitutes thus falling within a separate market. Having done so, the pleading, in principle, need do no more so far as the market is concerned. In order to make good the remaining elements of s 45A , the applicant must plead that the provision of the contract, arrangement or understanding has the purpose or effect or likely effect of, put in abbreviated terms, fixing a price for the contestable supply of these services."

Case16213,cited,Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177,"Section 52 of the Act provides that a corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. Proceedings before this Court involving s 52 claims are not infrequent and feature widely varying factual scenarios. A number of principles should be kept in mind in considering claims in the context of s 52. These include the following: 1. Section 52 of the Act requires that the relevant corporation engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive. Section 4(2)(a) of the Act provides that: a reference to engaging in conduct shall be read as a reference to doing or refusing to do any act, including the making of, or the giving effect to a provision of, a contract or arrangement, the arriving at, or the giving effect to a provision of, an understanding or the requiring of the giving of, or the giving of, a covenant. ""Conduct"" is not co-extensive with ""representation"" in s 52 (Lockhart and Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems 2000 (Developments) Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd (1993) 42 FCR 470 at 504, Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ at 603, McHugh J at 622) however engaging in conduct does encompass making representations (cf McGrath; in the matter of Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd (in liq) v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 at [150] ). 2. Where a party alleges that the conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, it is ordinarily necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the court the nature of the alleged conduct and the circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading: McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318 (cf for example, Lahoud v Lahoud [2006] NSWCA 169 at [91] , Yang v American International Assurance Co (Australia) Ltd [2008] FCA 39 at [89] ). 3. Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances: Watson 49 NSWLR 315 at 318 (cf for example Christofidellis v Zdrilic [1999] FCA 39 , Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Ltd (No 6) (2007) 63 ACLR 1 at 107, Yang FCA 39 at [89]). 4. The essential characteristic of misleading or deceptive conduct is that it contains or conveys a meaning which is false ( Global Sportsman Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88). 5. There will be no contravention unless error or misconception results from the conduct of the corporation, and not from other circumstances for which the corporation is not responsible ( Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1989] FCA 506 ; (1990) ATPR 40-994 at 50,950; Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act (29th ed) 1.51.5). 6. Whether or not conduct is misleading or deceptive is a question of fact to be decided by considering what is said and done against the background of all surrounding circumstances ( Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 202). 7. The words likely to mislead or deceive add little to s 52; at most they make it clear that it is unnecessary to prove that the conduct in question actually deceived or misled anyone (Gibbs CJ in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 198). Conduct will be likely to mislead or deceive if there is a real or not remote chance or possibility of misleading or deceiving, regardless of whether it is more than 50% ( Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; 149 CLR 191 at [6] , [15], Equity Access Pty Ltd ATPR 40-994 at 50,950, Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , McHugh J in Butcher [2004] HCA 60 ; 218 CLR 592 at 626). 8. Silence, or failure to disclose information, can fall within the gamut of misleading or deceptive conduct in the sense that having regard to all the relevant circumstances, it constitutes conduct that has been misleading or deceptive or that is likely to mislead or deceive ( Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky [1992] FCA 557 ; (1992) 39 FCR 31 at 32, 41; Fleetman Pty Ltd v Cairns Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 80 at [1] - [2] ). 9. The conduct of a corporation must be viewed as a whole. It would be wrong to select some words or act which, alone, would be likely to mislead if those words or acts, when viewed in their context, were not capable of misleading (Gibbs CJ in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; 149 CLR 191 at 199). 10. As a general rule intention (or lack of intention) to mislead or deceive is not a necessary element of conduct proscribed by s 52 ( Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd (1978) 140 CLR 216 at 228). The liability imposed by s 52 is unrelated to fault (Gibbs CJ in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; 149 CLR 191 at 197). 11. The court must decide objectively whether the conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, and that evidence that members of the public have actually been misled is not conclusive, although it can be very persuasive (Gibbs CJ in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; 149 CLR 191 at 198-199, McWilliam's Wines Pty Ltd v McDonald's System of Australia [1980] FCA 159 ; (1980) 33 ALR 394 per Smithers J at 399 and Fisher J at 414, Equity Access Pty Ltd ATPR 40-994 at 50,950). 238 However in relation to the issue of the Ellendale fruit crop on the land being held on the trees past their pick date, I am not persuaded that the first respondent owed any such obligation. No evidence was given by Mr Tracy as to his expectations in relation to the Ellendales. Nor has it been shown that the fact of late picking of fruit, in the context of operating orchards, was information which required disclosure. Further, even assuming that the first respondent was silent in relation to this issue, the applicants have not shown how such conduct lead the applicants into error within the meaning of s 52 so as to constitute conduct of a misleading or deceptive nature ( Taco Bell 42 ALR 177). For example it has not been demonstrated that: &#8226; there was any expectation on the part of the applicants that the Ellendales would be picked at any particular time; or &#8226; information concerning any delays in picking of the Ellendales would be communicated to the applicants, so that silence on the matter meant that picking had not been delayed; or &#8226; even if picking was delayed, the applicants would suffer detriment ( Winterton Constructions Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 582 ; 39 FCR 97 at 114); or &#8226; information as to the timing of the picking of the Ellendales was material to any decision of the applicants (cf Fraser 55 FCR 452)."

Case24034,cited,New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4 ; (2003) 212 CLR 511,"Each of the individual respondents was a full time official of either the CFMEU or CFMEU NSW. Each was engaged in what may broadly be called union business on the days in question. No one was on a frolic of his own. For relevant purposes, officers of each organisation were cooperating or acting in concert to achieve a result. The conduct of each was in the course of employment. Each organisation is liable on ordinary principles of vicarious liability in tort ( New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4 ; (2003) 212 CLR 511 per Gleeson CJ at [40] [41]). 86 I reject the submission that the interference with contract was limited to the couple of hours for which the car was parked across the vehicular access to the site on 21 October 2003. It follows from the findings previously made that the intention of the officials of the Union was to ensure that the contract was terminated and that Silvestri P/L did not return to the site. Whilst closure of the site on 21 October 2003 might be directly attributed to the Council, the closure of the site for that reason was not the effective cause of the termination of the contract with Silvestri P/L. That result was achieved by the concerted action of the Union officials. 87 Liability can be summarised as follows: (1) Lane, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 170NC. (2) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 45D. (3) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW induced a breach of the contract between LGB and Silvestri P/L."
Case4202,cited,Vroon BV v Foster's Brewing Group Ltd [1994] 2 VR 32,"the lack of any direct written evidence of an agreement between Adnunat and ITW, Adnunat contends that one must be inferred from their conduct. A contract may in certain circumstances be inferred from conduct, even where no offer and acceptance can be identified: see Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 97326 ; Vroon BV v Foster's Brewing Group Ltd [1994] 2 VR 32 ( Vroon ); Industrial Rollformers [2001] NSWCA 111 ; (2001) Aust Contract R 90-129. However the existence or otherwise of an enforceable agreement depends ultimately on the manifest intention of the parties, objectively ascertained: see Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 540 at 548-50 (Gleeson CJ) and his Honour's reference to Gissing v Gissing [1970] UKHL 3 ; [1971] AC 886 ; see also Cheshire &amp; Fifoot's Law of Contract (9 th ed, LexisNexis, 2008) at [3.5] and [3.9]. Where mutual promises are sought to be inferred, the conduct relied upon must, on an objective assessment, evince a tacit agreement with sufficiently clear terms. It is not enough that the conduct is consistent with what are alleged to be the terms of a binding agreement. The evidence must positively indicate that both parties considered themselves bound by that agreement: Industrial Rollformers [2001] NSWCA 111 ; (2001) Aust Contract R 90-129 at [137] - [138] and [142]; Pacific Brands Sport &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 288 ( Pacific Brands ) at [47]. Second, it is true that ITW continued to order 9 tonne anchors from Adnunat over a period spanning four months from March to June 2005. However as I have said earlier, the parties' intentions as revealed by that conduct alone are not unequivocal. Taking into account the matters I have referred to at [41]-[43], it is reasonably arguable that the parties were simply content as a practical commercial matter to continue a pre-existing anchor purchase and supply relationship, without having directed their attention to whether ITW would be bound by the Settlement Deed. It is of some relevance in that regard that this is not a case in which the relevant conduct took place over a long period of time (cf Pacific Brands [2005] FCA 288 and Vroon [1994] 2 VR 32) but instead came to an apparently abrupt end after only four months. It may be that ITW considered it commercially expedient to continue sourcing anchors from Adnunat rather than to challenge the Patent and manufacture the 9 tonne anchors it required itself. While that is speculation at this stage, it highlights the difficulty in finding that ITW has no reasonable prospects. Adnunat relied in particular on the email from Mr Pleysiar (see [10]) and contended that it was consistent only with a demand for supply pursuant to the Settlement Deed. However the email makes no reference to the Settlement Deed and the insistence on supply might be said to have arisen just as much from the commercial exigencies ITW faced at the time, compounded by Adnunat's apparent inability to meet existing purchase orders."
Case13104,applied,"Coco v AN Clark (Engineering) Ltd [1969] RPC 41 , ","The information submitted by Krueger to be confidential is described above (see [3]). I will deal with each element of the test in Coco in turn. 89 As Megarry J put it, ""there can be no breach of confidence in revealing to others something which is already common knowledge"" ( Coco, at 47). However, the standard that must be met to establish the necessary quality of confidence is low. For example, confidentiality can attach to information that is not entirely novel or original, provided the information was not commonly or publicly known at the time of the alleged breach. Confidentiality can also attach to a design that draws on already known information to create a new solution to a problem. In British Celanese Ltd v Courtaulds Ltd (1935) 52 RPC 171 at 193, Lord Tomlin observed that there may well be inventive merit in combining in one combination, integers which are themselves old or the subject of common knowledge. In fact, that which is required to transform common knowledge into a matter of commercial confidence may involve little more than ""work done by the maker upon materials which may be available for the use of anybody, so as to achieve a result which can only be achieved by somebody who goes through the same process"": Ansell Rubber Co Pty Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd [1967] VR 37 at 49 per Gowans J. 92 Before proceeding, however, I pause here to note that care must be taken in using such loaded terms as ""novel"" in this context. The parties proceeded in this case as if it were a patent matter, presenting expert testimony regarding prior art, common general knowledge, and so forth. That is to say, they implicitly proceeded as if the Krueger design had to be patentable in order to be confidential. No doubt this approach was influenced at least in part by the ongoing patent application by Krueger in respect of the design at issue and the fact that the same experts were retained by the parties in both proceedings; Camerons' expert gave candid evidence that he was unaware of any distinction between patent, copyright, and breach of confidence litigation, and that he and Krueger's expert approached this case as if it were a patent dispute. Unfortunately, this is a fundamentally wrong approach in breach of confidence litigation. As Megarry J said in Coco (at 48), one should not get caught up by particular adjectives such as novel; ""whether it is described as originality or novelty or ingenuity or otherwise, I think there must be some product of the human brain which suffices to confer a confidential nature upon the information"". To put it more plainly, information need not be patentable, copyrightable, or otherwise protected by the intellectual property laws in order to be confidential. Common examples of commercial information that may be considered confidential even if not novel in the patent law sense include customer lists, price lists, business proposals, and marketing strategies. In this regard, I would draw the parties' attention to the concise definition of confidentiality provided by IP Toolbox in its handy reference page, ""The concept of legal confidentiality"" (available at http://www.iptoolbox.gov.au/default.asp?print=true&amp;action=article&amp;ID=194): Confidential information need not be entirely composed of information that is not available publicly. Public information can also be considered as confidential. This depends on the way a business uses the information. A customer list, for example, can be protected as having the necessary legal confidentiality where it has been developed and treated as confidential, even though it is drawn from information which is publicly known (ie. telephone records, trade journals, public registers etc). Legal confidentiality can be distinguished from the requirements for patent or design registration. The latter require that the concept be inventive and novel (or in the case of a design, an advance on the 'prior art' base). Legal confidentiality can protect uninventive information as long as it is not in the public domain. (Emphasis added.) 93 Notwithstanding that definition, the obligation of the Court is to decide the case that has been put, not the case that should have been put. Accordingly, I will approach the issue of confidentiality as it was argued - that for the Krueger Concept to be protected it must not have been routine or otherwise a minor variation of common general knowledge. In that respect, Krueger submitted that there were at least two bases on which its design could be seen as novel as compared to existing load restraint systems. I turn to consider those bases now. 94 Camerons accepted that an ability for gates to overlap or stack would have set the Krueger Concept apart from pre-existing load restraint systems so that the Krueger Concept would not have been routine or already publicly known. Camerons submitted, however, that the ability of the gates to overlap or stack was, in fact, not conveyed by the confidential information. 104 The concession of Mr Cameron does not end the inquiry, however, because not everything that is confidential in business is necessarily deemed confidential in law. What is important for information to attract a legal obligation of confidence is that ""the preservation of its confidentiality or secrecy is of substantial concern to the plaintiff"": Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 438. In Moorgate , the High Court found that information relating to a new cigarette brand was not confidential in part because it comprised merely standard marketing materials that would be shown to any prospective licensees, not just the defendant. Here, on the other hand, it is clear that Krueger created the information and communicated it to Camerons so that Krueger, and only Krueger, would win the business with Camerons. It is thus objectively reasonable in the circumstances of this case that the preservation of the information's confidentiality and secrecy (specifically, its non-disclosure to competitors such as Vawdrey) was of substantial concern to Krueger. Accordingly, I conclude that the information in [3] attracted an obligation of confidentiality under the 'reasonable man' test propounded by Megarry J in Coco at 48. 106 Analysis of this third element requires what Megarry J in Coco (at 50) describes as both a strict and broad approach. The strict approach, which Megarry J suggested should be applied in commercial cases such as this, requires some detriment suffered by the provider of the confidential information for equity to intervene. In contrast, under the broad approach, unauthorised use does not necessarily need to be accompanied by detriment. In the years since Coco , however, the cases have cast considerable doubt on whether detriment should be considered part of the cause of action even in commercial cases: see L Tsaknis, "" The Jurisdictional Basis, Elements and Remedies in the Action for Breach of Confidence Uncertainty Abounds "" (1993) 5 Bond University Review 18, 21-23 (collecting the cases and stating, ""It is not clear whether the confider must suffer any detriment as a result of the unauthorised disclosure, though the balance of the authority suggests that the better view is that detriment is not required""). I do not consider the point further, however, because Krueger did not raise it, relying instead principally on Coco . In any event, nothing much turns on detriment in the present case because detriment is not an issue if Krueger is successful in establishing the other elements, detriment was clearly suffered by Krueger in that it lost the contract with Camerons in respect of the Amcor Tender. 107 Krueger provided its information to Camerons for the limited purpose of winning a contract with Camerons for the manufacture of approximately 20 truck trailers. In order to advance this purpose, it allowed Camerons to include part of that information (the Subsequent Krueger Drawings) in the tender Camerons submitted to Amcor. As noted earlier, it was not submitted that the authorised disclosure of the Subsequent Krueger Drawing to Amcor robbed that drawing of its confidential character or released Camerons from its otherwise general obligation to maintain it in confidence. Camerons had asked for permission to disclose it to Amcor. It had not asked for permission to disclose it more generally. 108 That leaves the issue of unauthorised use of the confidential information. If it is shown that Camerons provided Krueger's information (or part of it) to Vawdrey, allowing Vawdrey to eventually win the work with Camerons, Krueger suffered detriment from that unauthorised use. As noted earlier in these reasons (see [81] to [83]), I concluded that Camerons, knowing the Krueger Concept to contain information confidential to Krueger, made unauthorised use of it by disclosing it to Vawdrey without the consent of Krueger."

As his Honour observed, s 192 provides that in granting leave or making a direction, the Court is to take into account, amongst other things, the powers which it has to make another order or to give directions in relation to evidence; see s 192(2)(e) of the Evidence Act . Austin J was of the view that the Court could not make a determination under s 26 of the Evidence Act as sought in that case because it was premature; see Rich at [15]. His Honour was of the view that the Court was not yet in a position to identify or assess all of the matters which must be taken into account in deciding whether to give a direction. 8 That seems to me to be the position in the present case. I will have, at the trial, power to make orders under a number of sections of the Evidence Act , including s 38 which deals with unfavourable witnesses, s 41 which deals with improper questions and, in particular, s 42 which deals with the power of the Court to limit or disallow the use of leading questions where, for example, a witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner or where the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination.

Case1830,cited,Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34,"Notwithstanding the long-standing principle that the door of the court should not be barred to a prospective applicant because of impecuniosity (Bowen LJ in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38, Full Court of the Federal Court in Cherry v Read (unreported, Black CJ, Sackville and Finn JJ, 21 November 1996 at 8), and note cases discussed in GE Dal Pont Law of Costs LexisNexis Butterworths 2003 at p 955) the protective object of an order for security for costs is well known. As Einstein J said in Idoport Pty Limited &amp; Anor v National Australia Bank Limited [2001] NSWSC 744 at [52] : 'The purpose of a security for costs order is therefore a protective jurisdiction to ensure that the primary purposes for having costs orders themselves, can be achieved.

Case12795,referred to,Esber v The Commonwealth of Australia [1992] HCA 20 ; (1992) 174 CLR 430,"There is a further reason for rejecting the applicant's submission that s 8(c) of the Acts Interpretation Act afforded it the protection of s 347(1) after 27 March 2006. In order for s 8(c) to operate it is necessary to identify a right or privilege which was in existence at the time that the amendments to s 347 occurred. Such rights may be inchoate or contingent but they must exist: see Esber v The Commonwealth of Australia [1992] HCA 20 ; (1992) 174 CLR 430 at 440. Section 347 prevented the Court from making a costs order against a party to a proceeding under the Act unless the proceeding (including interlocutory applications) was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause. Such ""protection"" could only avail a party once the relevant procedural step had been taken. In the present case each of the procedural events which give rise to the respondent's application for costs occurred after 27 March 2006. Even if the protective effect of s 347(1) can, contrary to my view, be regarded as a right, the ""proceedings"" to which s 347(1) are said to apply had yet to be instituted and, therefore, no relevant right or privilege had been acquired or had accrued on 27 March 2006. 23 As already noted the respondent seeks an order for costs in relation to its two strike-out applications and the hearing conducted on 9 May 2006. In order to deal with these applications it is necessary to record, in somewhat greater detail than has thus far been attempted, the circumstances which led to the making of the strike-out applications and the conduct of the hearing on 9 May 2006. 24 The proceeding was commenced by application dated 8 March 2006. A statement of claim was also filed on that day. On 9 June 2006 the applicant filed an amended statement of claim. On 16 June 2006, the respondent filed a notice of motion seeking orders striking-out the proceeding or, in the alternative, striking-out certain paragraphs of the amended statement of claim. The notice of motion was made returnable on 4 August 2006. The notice of motion was supported by a detailed affidavit in which the alleged deficiencies of the pleading were canvassed. Subsequently detailed written submissions were made by the respondent. After argument on the notice of motion had been advanced by counsel for the respondent on 4 August 2006, counsel for the applicant sought leave to file a further amended statement of claim. I granted leave and reserved costs. The revised statement of claim was filed on 28 August 2006. Although some of the alleged deficiencies in earlier versions of the pleaded case appeared to have been rectified in the revised statement, the respondent continued to press its strike-out application. Further written submissions were exchanged, further argument was heard, and, on 6 November 2006, I ordered that the applicant's further amended statement of claim be struck-out and that the applicant have leave to file a further amended statement of claim on or before 30 November 2006. Despite granting leave I noted that I harboured a serious doubt that the applicant could amend its statement of claim to advance a case under s 298K conformably with the reasons which I had given for striking-out the amended statement of claim. No order for costs was sought by the respondent."

But such is not the present case. The alternative manner in which the Appellants seek to advance their first Ground of Appeal is to allege a denial of "" procedural fairness "" on the part of the Tribunal by reference to the "" weight "" given by the Tribunal to the claims previously advanced by the mother. The Tribunal considered the claims made by the Applicants' mother in her earlier unsuccessful application for a protection visa and relevantly concluded as follows: [97] The Tribunal is satisfied that the Applicants' father is competent to speak on behalf of the Applicants. The Tribunal accepts that the Applicants' mother was happy to leave this role to her husband and that she did not wish to speak on behalf of her children. The Tribunal draws no negative inferences from her stated unwillingness to speak at the RRT hearing. [98] The Tribunal does, however, have regard to the comments she gave in response to its concerns about the difference between the claims she raised on behalf of the Applicants' family in 2005 and the claims now being raised by her husband on behalf of the present Applicants. It is fair to observe that the 2006 coup had not occurred at that stage, so that is one factual element that the Applicants' mother could not logically have been in a position to discuss or even reasonably predict, but that does not satisfactorily explain why the Applicants' mother claimed that her family was being harassed by Speight supporters over all those years, whereas her husband later claimed that they were being harassed by the forces that were actually trying to break up the Speight putsch . [99] The Tribunal gives weight to the fact that the claims lodged by the Applicants' mother, and also evidently subscribed to at the time by the Applicants' father (according to what he said to the presently-constituted Tribunal in oral evidence and in writing), were denounced by both of the Applicants' parents, at the RRT hearing, and by the Applicants' father in writing later on, as false claims ."
Case5944,applied,Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc and Another [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24,"Mr Mooney's evidence supports the view that the forestry operations in Wielangta in coupes 17E and 19D and the proposed forestry operations in Wielangta in coupes other than 17E and 19D are not likely to have a significant impact on the eagle, having regard to its endangered status and all other threats to the eagle. However, despite that view, a question arises about whether, as a matter of law, an impact may be significant because of its 'cumulative' or 'potential' impacts; see Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc and Another ( 'Queensland Conservation Council' ) [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24 at [60] . 92 As a Full Court said in Queensland Conservation Council at [53]: 'It is unhelpful, we consider, to attempt to paraphrase the expression ""all adverse impacts"" in s 75(2)(a) of the EPBC Act by recourse to phrases like ""inextricably involved"" or ""natural consequence"". ""Impact"" in the relevant sense means the influence or effect of an action: Oxford English Dictionary , [2 nd ed] 5. As the respondents submitted, the word ""impact"" is often used with regard to ideas, concepts and ideologies: ""impact"" in its ordinary meaning can readily include the ""indirect"" consequences of an action and may include the results of acts done by persons other than the principal actor. Expressions such as ""the impact of science on society"" or ""the impact of drought on the economy"" serve to illustrate the point. Accordingly, we take s 75(2) to require the Environment Minister to consider each way in which a proposed action will, or is likely to, adversely influence or effect the world heritage values of a declared World Heritage property or listed migratory species. As a matter of ordinary usage that influence or effect may be direct or indirect. ""Impact"" in this sense is not confined to direct physical effects of the action on the matter protected by the relevant provision of Pt 3 of Ch 2 of the EPBC Act. It includes effects which are sufficiently close to the action to allow it to be said, without straining the language, that they are, or would be, the consequences of the action on the protected matter. Provided that the concept is understood and applied correctly in this way, it is a question of fact for the Environment Minister whether a particular adverse effect is an ""impact"" of a proposed action. However, we do not consider that the Environment Minister did apply the correct test in answering the question of fact which had arisen in the present case.' 93 Mr Mooney's definition of 'impact' as embracing effects 'significantly close to allow it to be said that they are the consequences of forestry operations' provides a more limited view of the word 'impact' than that adopted by the Full Court, that is, the influence or effect of an action. 94 Even though forestry operations in Wielangta (in coupes 17E and 19D) and the proposed forestry operations in coupes other than 17E and 19D will cause a loss of breeding and foraging habitat for the eagle which is relatively insignificant in the context of other factors causing loss to such habitat, that loss can still be considered 'significant' in the context of legislation which is designed 'to protect native species (and in particular prevent the extinction, and promote the recovery, of threatened species)...'. Loss of habitat caused by forestry operations, while small when compared to other causes, has a significant impact on a threatened species where 'to protect' is seen as a duty not just to maintain population levels of threatened species but to restore the species. 295 Construction of the EPBC Act is informed by the Conventions which it implements in compliance with Australia's international obligations. So much was recognised by a Full Court of this Court in Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc and Anor [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24 (' Queensland Conservation Council ') at [2]: 'The EPBC Act was enacted to implement the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity 1992 , and other international environmental agreements into Australian law. It also represents an attempt to consolidate and clarify the Commonwealth's responsibilities for environmental protection within the Australian Federation (see Second Reading Speech, House of Representatives, Hansard, 29 June 1999, at 7770). The objects of the EPBC Act are set out in s 3(1) as follows: The objects of this Act are: (a) to provide for the protection of the environment, especially those aspects of the environment that are matters of national environmental significance; and (b) to promote ecologically sustainable development through the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources; and (c) to promote the conservation of biodiversity; and (ca) to provide for the protection and conservation of heritage; and (d) to promote a co-operative approach to the protection and management of the environment involving governments, the community, land-holders and indigenous peoples; and (e) to assist in the co-operative implementation of Australia's international environmental responsibilities; and (f) to recognise the role of indigenous people in the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of Australia's biodiversity; and (g) to promote the use of indigenous peoples' knowledge of biodiversity with the involvement of, and in co-operation with, the owners of the knowledge.' 297 The Biodiversity Convention referred to by the Full Court in Queensland Conservation Council underpins the EPBC Act. It obliges Australia to take steps to promote conservation and the recovery of threatened species; see Arts 8(d), (e) and (f). 298 Australia is also a signatory to the Convention on Conservation of Nature in the South Pacific (done at Apia, Western Samoa on 12 June 1976), otherwise known as the Apia Convention. Australia acceded to the Apia Convention on 28 March 1990 and it came into force in Australia on 26 June 1990. It requires Contracting Parties to: '1. ... in addition to the protection given to indigenous fauna and flora in protected areas, use their best endeavours to protect such fauna and flora (special attention being given to migratory species) so as to safeguard them from unwise exploitation and other threats that may lead to their extinction. 2. ... establish and maintain a list of species of its indigenous fauna and flora that are threatened with extinction. Such lists shall be prepared as soon as possible after this Convention has come into force and shall be communicated to the body charged with the continuing bureau duties under this Convention. 3. ... protect as completely as possible as a matter of special urgency and importance the species included in the list it has established in accordance with the provisions of the last preceding paragraph. The hunting, killing, capture or collection of specimens (including eggs and shells) of such species shall be allowed only with the permission of the appropriate authority. Such permission shall be granted only under special circumstances, in order to further scientific purposes or when essential for the maintenance of the equilibrium of the ecosystem or for the administration of the area in which the animal or plant is found. 4. ... carefully consider the consequences of the deliberate introduction into ecosystems of species which have not previously occurred therein.' 299 Section 139 of the EPBC Act implements these two Conventions by providing: 'In deciding whether or not to approve for the purposes of a subsection of section 18 or section 18A the taking of an action, and what conditions to attach to such an approval, the Minister must not act inconsistently with: (a) Australia's obligations under: (i) the Biodiversity Convention; or (ii) the Apia Convention; or (iii) CITES; or (b) a recovery plan or threat abatement plan.'"

Nevertheless, in my opinion the overriding principle stated by Clarke JA seems to be the appropriate test. That is, the exercise of the court's discretion is dependent upon whether the interests of justice require leave to be granted or refused.

Case23281,distinguished,Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc. v The Minister for the Environment (No.1) (1996) 69 FCR 1 ,"IFT contends that the fact that Gunns was joined to the proceeding on its own application should be taken into account when exercising the Court's discretion to award costs. IFT relies on the case of Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc. v The Minister for the Environment (No. 1) (1996) 69 FCR 1 for the proposition that it is appropriate to deny Gunns its costs in circumstances where it was joined to the proceeding as an interested person on its own application. In Friends of Hinchinbrook , Branson J imposed a condition on the joinder that the additional respondent not seek its costs in the proceeding. That decision was upheld on appeal: Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc. v The Minister for Environment (unreported, Northrop, Burchett and Hill JJ, 27 May 1997). 9 In Friends of Hinchinbrook at 13, Branson J did not view the State of Queensland as a necessary party to the proceeding. In this matter Gunns was a necessary party to the proceeding. Its rights and interests were capable of being directly affected by any order made in the proceeding. It should have been joined at the outset: see, News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 523-525. It is irrelevant that IFT did not seek any relief against Gunns. The challenge to the Minister's decisions involved IFT seeking relief against him and not Gunns. Even so, Gunns' direct interest in the outcome of the challenge was greater than any direct interest apart from that of the Minister."
Case5591,cited,R v Firns [2001] NSWCCA 191 ; (2001) 51 NSWLR 548,"The question of whether a matter is ""readily observable"" is one of fact. Observability does not depend on proof that persons actually perceived the information; the test is objective and hypothetical: see R v Firns [2001] NSWCCA 191 ; (2001) 51 NSWLR 548 at [88] per Mason P. 547 Where the information is a ""matter of supposition"", the question of whether it is generally available depends on whether the supposition is capable of being made or drawn by other investors based on readily observable matter or information that has been made known in the manner stated in s 1042C(1)(b)(i) of the Corporations Act : see s 1042C(1)(c). 548 ASIC called Mr Sisson to give expert evidence. However, his first report dated 31 October 2006 did not deal with the question of whether the ""information"" relied on by ASIC was generally available. Mr Sisson did address the question briefly in a later report dated 16 March 2007, in reply to the evidence of Citigroup's expert, Mr Richard Mews. 551 However, in my view, the test applied by Mr Sisson as to whether the information was generally available was not in accordance with that which has been recognised by the authorities. There are two reasons for this. First, the test of whether material is readily observable is not whether the particular matter was widely observed but whether it could have been: see R v Firns at [88], [91] per Mason P; see also Hannes v DPP at [626] per Barr and Hall JJ. 552 The second reason is that s 1042C(1)(c) of the Corporations Act does not appear to involve a consideration of whether the market has had a reasonable time to absorb the information: see the analysis of the extrinsic material in [55] [56] of the judgment of Mason P in R v Firns . His Honour was of the view that Parliament's intention was not to ""penalise individual initiative and diligence."" 553 Thus, it seems to me that Mr Sisson's evidence on this question must be rejected. The effect of what he did was to ask whether it was generally available by considering the question of whether it was generally known. 554 Nevertheless, it does not follow that I must find that the information was generally available. Citigroup submitted that I should make this finding upon the basis of the evidence of its expert, Mr Mews. But I am not satisfied that Mr Mews' evidence establishes the proposition for which Citigroup contends."
Case21624,applied,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v W157/00A [2002] FCAFC 281 ; (2002) 125 FCR 433,"Counsel for the Minister submitted that the Minister had considered the best interests of each of the applicant's children and that this was obvious from [24] to [26] of the reasons. Even accepting that the Minister did not expressly state that a decision to cancel the applicant's visa was not in the best interests of his children, that was the clear import of [26]. Reference was made to a number of decisions which make it clear that the Court was entitled to infer from reasons that the matter had been addressed even if the conclusion was not expressly stated: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v W157/00A [2002] FCAFC 281 ; (2002) 125 FCR 433 at [77] per Branson J (with whom Goldberg J at [84] and Allsop J at [88] relevantly agreed); Van Son v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 875 at [36] ; Chong Mun Chai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1460 at [47] ; Sebastian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1054 at [47] - [51] , an appeal from which was dismissed by the Full Court in Sebastian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 31. Counsel for the Minister submitted that Wan , the main authority relied upon by the applicant, was clearly distinguishable on the facts. The Tribunal in Wan had not described the best interests of the child as a primary consideration: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affars [2005] FCAFC 13 at [68] . The Tribunal in Wan had demonstrably failed to consider the interests of the children as a primary consideration and in subsequent cases, the Court had been prepared to accept that the issue had been considered notwithstanding limited express consideration of the issue: see for example Van Son and Chong Mun Chai . They had also been unable to find any decision considering or following Wan in which it had been said that findings as to which decision will best serve the interests of the child can never be inferred. 30 The identification of the best interests of the children has been described as the appropriate ""starting point"" for considering those interests as a primary consideration: see Wan at [26] and W157/00A at [77] per Branson J, with whom Goldberg and Allsop JJ agreed. In Wan , the Full Court was particularly critical of the Tribunal's failure to identify what the best interests of the children indicated that it should decide (at [26]). This arose in a context where the Tribunal had not identified the children's best interests as being a ""primary consideration"" and appeared to have approached the question of the children's best interests on the assumption that the applicant's visa would be cancelled. The Tribunal looked at how the children would be affected if their father was removed from Australia and the question of whether the children should relocate. The Full Court found that the Tribunal had erred by not identifying what the best interests of the children indicated that it should decide and, said that even if it was wrong in that conclusion, that it was ""inescapable that the Tribunal did not treat the best interests of the children as 'a primary consideration'"". In relation to the proper approach to be taken, the Full Court said (at [32]): ...Provided that the Tribunal did not treat any other consideration as inherently more significant than the best interests of Mr Wan's children, it was entitled to conclude, after a proper consideration of the evidence and other material before it, that the strength of other considerations outweighed the best interests of the children. However, it was required to identify what the best interests of Mr Wan's children required with respect to the exercise of its discretion and then to assess whether the strength of any other consideration, or the cumulative effect of other considerations, outweighed the consideration of the best interests of the children understood as a primary consideration. 35 In W157/00A , Branson J found that it was not open to the Court to positively conclude that the Minister did not take the respondent's children into account as a primary consideration in the decision to cancel his visa under s 501 of the Act . In that case, the respondent was advised of the decision in a letter which stated that a copy of the decision record was attached. The decision record was a departmental briefing paper, which, the Court concluded, could not on the facts be regarded as setting out the Minister's reasons for decision. However, the issues document set out various matters concerning the respondent's children and was before the Minister in making the decision. Branson J in that context said (at [77]): ...[I]n this case, as the content of the issues document reflects, everything pointed towards the best interests of the children favouring a decision not to cancel the respondent's visa. It would, in my view, be unrealistic to conclude that this was not appreciated by the Minister. 36 The approach indicated by Branson J has been applied or cited with approval by single judges in Van Son at [36] and Chong Mun Chai at [47]. The facts in Chong Mung Chai were similar to the present and, unlike in W157/00A and Van Son , the Minister had provided a statement of reasons. In Chong Mun Chai , the Minister's reasons said that the children would ""suffer significant hardship"" if the applicant's visa was cancelled, because the applicant's wife and children did not plan to accompany him to South Korea if he was removed. As in the present case, the Minister's reasons did not in terms state what decision was found to be in the children's best interests. In that case, Madgwick J did not accept the submission that a failure to expressly advert in the reasons to aspects of the family break up which would be contrary to the children's interests justified a conclusion that the Minister failed to consider the children's best interests as a primary consideration. Noting that the Minister had said in the reasons that she had given primary consideration to the best interests of the children, and despite the ""restrained language"" of the reasons in discussing the children's interests, his Honour at [47] applied the approach of Branson J in W157/00A . It should also be applied in the present case."
Case8613,considered,Stack v Brisbane City Council [2004] FCA 354,"In Stack v Brisbane City Council [2004] FCA 354 (the Third Set of Reasons) Cooper J said at [21] and [22]: For there to arise an issue estoppel binding against Stack and GST it must be shown that: (a) the issue ruled upon was indispensable or fundamental to the ultimate decision: Blair and Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 531; (b) the judgment is capable of giving rise to an issue estoppel: Administration of the Territory of Papua New Guinea v Guba [1973] HCA 59 ; (1973) 130 CLR 353 at 451; (c) the issues must be the same in each proceeding: Blair v Curran at 510, 532, 541; and (d) the parties to be bound by an issue estoppel were in controversy on the issue in question: Ramsay v Pigram [1968] HCA 34 ; (1968) 118 CLR 271 at 276, 279; Taylor v Ansett Transport Industries Ltd (1987) 18 FCR 342 at 356-358; 365. A practical test as to whether an issue was indispensable or fundamental to the ultimate decision is whether an appeal lies from a finding in respect of the issue: Murphy v Abi-Saab (1995) 37 NSWLR 280 at 288. In the instant case, each of the declarations was appealed to the Full Court of this Court and special leave to appeal in respect of them was refused by the High Court of Australia. Further, the fact that the proceedings were in respect of preliminary issues does not deny that they were capable of creating issues estoppel binding the parties to the proceedings: Fidelitas Shipping Co Ltd v V/O Exportchleb [1966] 1 QB 630 at 642."
Case308,cited,Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163,"in turn were enlarged upon in Mr Kronen's written submissions. These revealed that much of his complaint was with matters of fact involving merits-review. He is now aware that a wrong fact finding is not sufficient to establish an error of law: Waterford v The Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77. Nonetheless, the submissions also exposed that he was taking issue with the manner in which the Tribunal purported to apply the statute to the circumstances. In this one can discern that in several respects he was contending that the Tribunal fell into an error of law which caused it to identify a wrong issue, to ask itself a wrong question, and to ignore relevant material, so exceeding its authority or powers: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179. The essence of his complaints are both that the Tribunal failed to apply the correct sections of the Act (eg s 615), and misconstrued or misapplied the terms of the Act (eg ""to be negotiated"" or ""reasonable excuse""). To this extent, as I will indicate, I am satisfied that Mr Kronen's application to this Court has in some degree enlivened its jurisdiction under the AAT Act. Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success and for the reason that in ascribing error to the Tribunal he misapprehends the scheme of the Act and of the decision-making processes it mandates."
Case3281,cited,BMI Ltd v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (1983) 51 ALR 401,"The making of the declaratory order sought is a little more problematical. The Court has a wide discretionary power to make declarations under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): see Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581-2. The circumstances in which that power may be exercised are not circumscribed by strict rules: see per Gibbs J in Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Limited [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437. However, there has been a long held view that a declaration, a judicial act, should be made only on evidence and not simply on admissions or (as in this case) on deemed admissions: see BMI Ltd v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (1983) 51 ALR 401; Termijtelen v Van Arkel [1974] 1 NSWLR 525 at 533; Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 1 WLR 911 at 1029. In addition, it is appropriate to be cautious because a declaration may have effects more broadly than as between the particular litigants: Myer Queenstown Garden Plaza Pty Ltd v City of Port Adelaide (1975) 33 LGRA 70 at 82 per Wells J; Sung Li Holdings Ltd v Medicom Finance Pty Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 955."
Case23677,cited,Deane-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd (1997) 42 NSWLR 209,"The distinction between the status of court appointed liquidators and liquidators appointed under voluntary administrators, as a basis for the distinction between the language of s 479(3) and s 511 has long been recognised: see eg, Australian Securities Commission v Melbourne Asset Management Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager Appointed) (1994) 49 FCR 334 at 348-349 (Northrop J); Deane-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd (1997) 42 NSWLR 209. In the latter case Young J said that: ... the authorities tend to suggest that the court has the same jurisdiction under both sections... The reasons advanced in those and other cases for the conferral of express powers in s 511 are supported by the comment on one of its many predecessors, s 274 of the Uniform Companies Act 1961, in Wallace and Young, Australian Company Law and Practice (Law Book Co, 1965) at 759: the effect of this section (which the court has interpreted so as to give it wide powers) ... is to lessen the distinction between a voluntary and compulsory winding up. 50 Given the more substantive character of the applications contemplated by s 511(1)(a) the preceding observations are even more apposite in applications made under that provision. Whether the Court should proceed to entertain applications for the determination of substantive rights and award final relief as between competing creditors and others in an application under s 511, is a matter of discretion. As Young J said about s 511 in Deane-Willcocks 42 NSWLR 209 (at 212): There are many questions where the only order that the court should make is that the liquidator or the claimant proceed in the ordinary courts in the ordinary way for the determination of a dispute. However, there are many other situations where the court can summarily solve the difficulty that has arisen in the liquidation by an order under the section in a cheap and efficient manner. Where this can be done it is ""just and beneficial"" to exercise the power. 51 In my opinion it is open to the Court, in a suitable case, to entertain an application for the determination of questions under s 511 by joining affected parties with competing interests as defendants and permitting them to file cross-claims for declaratory relief as between themselves and any other interested parties and the liquidator so that there can be a res judicata between all of them. Such a course may be appropriate where the evidence necessary to determine the questions and the competing claims is largely documentary and amenable to expeditious hearing and determination. Otherwise the parties can simply commence their own substantive proceedings. 52 On the basis of the information provided at the directions hearing and the nature of the factual matters underpinning the questions raised by the liquidator, it appears likely that the resolution of the competing claims reflected in the liquidator's questions could proceed expeditiously on a largely documentary basis. I accept that there may be some oral evidence going to questions of estoppel in relation to IMF. Although the proposed statement of claim outlines a somewhat complex and convoluted sequence of transactions, the heavy documentary emphasis suggests that a largely documentary case can be run."
Case8321,cited,Bailey &amp; Co Ltd v Balholm Securities Ltd ,"(i) As an agent for sale ordinarily acts on behalf of its principal: but cf in relation to a broker selling in its own name: Bailey &amp; Co Ltd v Balholm Securities Ltd [1973] 2 Lloyd's Rep 404 at 408; Jackson Securities Ltd v Cheesman (1986) 4 NSWLR 484 at 489-490; is it apparent from the facts that the seller has actually conferred on the intermediary an authority to negotiate and/or to sell on the seller's behalf thus bringing into existence direct contracts between the seller and the third party buyer: Mercantile International Group plc at [30]-[34]? 55 There are two final matters to which I should refer. First, while the relationships of agency and sale are mutually exclusive, it is not uncommon for an intermediary to be the agent of its seller-principal but to be a principal vis-&agrave;-vis a third party on the sale to it: see eg Bailey &amp; Co Ltd v Balholm Securities Ltd at 408; Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd [1976] 1 WLR 676. As was said by Roskill LJ in Romalpa (at 690): I see no difficulty in the contractual concept that, as between the defendants and their sub-purchasers, the defendants sold as principals, but that, as between themselves and the plaintiffs, those goods which they were selling as principals within their implied authority from the plaintiffs were the plaintiffs' goods which they were selling as agents for the plaintiffs to whom they remained fully accountable. As will be seen, the respondents seek to draw some comfort from this."
Case16385,cited,Black &amp; Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 2) (2008) 76 IPR 99,The respondent has recently changed its name to Sunaone Pty Ltd. Under its former name GMCA Pty Ltd it was found to have infringed Black &amp; Decker's standard and innovation patents: Black &amp; Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 2) (2008) 76 IPR 99. I subsequently ordered that Black &amp; Decker's costs be the subject of a gross sum order under O 62 r 4(2)(c) and (d) of the Federal Court Rules : Black &amp; Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 4) [2008] FCA 1737.
Case3148,applied,Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325,"Justice Weinberg has usefully set out some other key aspects of the HREOC Act in the recent decision of Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [14] to [20]. I should note that Ms Bahonko submitted that the decision of Weinberg J should not be followed. However, leave to appeal from that decision was refused by Tracey J in Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1492 and in my respectful view, the statement of the relevant principles as set out by Weinberg J is correct. 47 Under s 46PO(2), it is clear that the Court has a discretion to grant an extension of time. The principles to be considered when deciding whether to extend time for the filing of an application were described by Weinberg J in the decision of Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at [21] to [24]. His Honour referred to the principles expounded by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-9, which related to an application for an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act'), and held that the principles therein stated were applicable to s 46PO. I respectfully agree with Weinberg J that those principles are relevantly applicable to an application under the HREOC Act. 50 However, it was always clear that the matter of the necessity for leave remained an issue. The way in which the proceeding has run its course has been a result of the number of interlocutory applications brought by all the parties which required consideration by the Court. No interlocutory application involved or proceeded on the basis that the issue of leave to file out of time was resolved in favour of Ms Bahonko. There can be no suggestion of waiver or abandonment by virtue of the conduct of the respondents to lead to the view that the extension of time issue need not be determined by me or that it did not remain a live issue for decision. Further, there is no basis to suggest that s 46PR is applicable to issues going to jurisdiction so as to permit me to consider the application for leave otherwise than in accordance with the principles set out above: see Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at [20] and [70]. Further, there can be no prejudice to Ms Bahonko, as the applications for summary dismissal, which were also before me, required consideration of the merits of the case, and therefore she was anticipating having to deal with the question of the merits of her complaints, and was given ample opportunity to do so. 51 The period of delay is not a significant one. Ms Bahonko explained that she had been involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11 April 2006 and was still ill from the time the Commission gave her notice of the termination of the complaint on 1 June 2006. She submitted a number of medical certificates which stated she was unfit to work because of the accident from 11 April 2006 to 17 July 2006. 52 On the basis of those certificates, I accept that Ms Bahonko was ill at the time she received notification of the complaint until 17 June 2006. I note that the delay in filing her proceeding is relatively short, and I consider her excuse is acceptable in the circumstances. 63 The Minister referred to the decision of Weinberg J concerning a discrimination proceeding brought by Ms Bahonko against the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ('RMIT') and others: see Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325. In that case, his Honour was similarly faced with an application for an extension of time, as Ms Bahonko had filed out of time, and an application for summary judgment made by one of the respondents. After his Honour considered the various claims, he refused to grant Ms Bahonko an extension of time, concluding in relation to the claims against RMIT as follows (at [86]): It would be quite wrong, in my view, to grant an extension of time in circumstances where there is a paucity of material to support claims of unlawful discrimination which are cast in sweeping, unparticularised and seemingly exaggerated terms. It is clear that the Commission acted correctly in terminating her complaints, having regard to the material that Ms Bahonko placed before it. The additional material placed before this Court in support of her application for review of the Commission's decision takes her case no further. 64 The Minister submitted that Ms Bahonko's material against the Minister was similarly sweeping, unparticularised and exaggerated and that the Commission was right to terminate and finalise her complaints against the Minister on the basis of the material before it. It was submitted that the additional material placed before this Court takes her case no further. In the alternative, it was submitted that if the material does take the case further, it is not the same or substantially the same as those in her complaints, and is therefore outside the scope of review by this Court under s 46PO(3). 116 In any event, I accept the Minister's submissions that the Minister's role in relation to the NBV was limited, in the same way Weinberg J found the role of the Minister for Education and Training was limited in Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325. The Minister was not directly involved in the decisions and conduct of the NBV, but rather the NBV was constituted as a distinct and separate body under the Nurses Act and its decisions were its own. 117 Further, and in any event, s 18A is confined to the acts of agents and employees which, as the Minister submitted, does not extend to the NBV, as the NBV is not an employee or agent of the Minister. True it is that the Minister appoints NBV members, but this does not make the Minister liable for actions of the NBV in relation to investigating professional conduct of nurses and imposing conditions on nurses' registrations: see also Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at 78. 118 Similarly, Ms Bahonko's claim that the Minister contravened s 122 of the DDA depended upon my finding that the NBV contravened s 42 of the DDA. On the basis of my finding above that there is no evidence to suggest that the NBV contravened s 42 , this claim is without merit. 119 I accept the Minister's submissions that Ms Bahonko did not make any credible claim against the Minister, and refuse her application for an extension of time to bring proceedings against the Minister."
Case24107,distinguished,Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 62,"Whilst the appellant relied upon the decisions of the Full Court in Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 62 and SZFOH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 63 , neither have application to the present proceedings since each of those cases concern service with regard to an 'authorised recipient' . For reasons referred to above, there was no appointment of such person in the present proceedings."
Case22035,referred to,BWK Elders (Australia) Pty Ltd v Westgate Wool Company Pty Ltd (No 6) [2002] FCA 807,"Furthermore, the applicant has recently changed its solicitors and is no longer represented by a small firm that carries on practise only in this State. The applicant has now instructed a firm which holds itself out as having a national presence. In affidavits filed in opposition to the respondents' application it was deposed on behalf of the applicant that ""Gadens"" represents ""a joint venture of independent firms carrying on business under the same name, 'Gadens'"". Whatever that may mean it may be concluded that any disadvantage that may have been inflicted upon the applicant if an order had been made for the proceeding to be transferred whilst it continued to be represented by Solomon Brothers is no longer a relevant consideration. (See: BWK Elders (Australia) Pty Ltd v Westgate Wool Company Pty Ltd (No 6) [2002] FCA 807). Circumstances have forced the applicant to change its solicitors and it may be assumed that being able to instruct solicitors who carry on business under the name Gadens in South Australia will be as convenient for the applicant as instructing practitioners who carry on business under that name in Western Australia given that the instructions are to be provided by persons resident in South Australia. 26 In addition to the foregoing another important change in circumstances is the need for another docket judge to be assigned the matter and to take over management of the proceeding. Obviously that may as easily be a judge in the South Australia District Registry of the Court as a judge in this registry. 27 Another recent event in the matter is the resurrection of the respondents' motion for the provision of security for costs by the applicant. As alluded to earlier in these reasons, on the current material provided the applicant offers personal guarantees and indemnities from the directors of the applicant by way of security. The worth of these offers depends upon the net worth of the property of the directors situated in South Australia. If further security is provided by the applicant in that form there will be a continuing prospect that interlocutory proceedings may occur related to the sufficiency of the security. The appropriate place for consideration of that issue would be in the South Australia District Registry of the Court."
Case12228,cited,"Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110","Quite apart from the problem that the alleged variation lacked consideration there was uncertainty about its terms. A reduction in fees for an unspecified but temporary period apparently to be determined at the will of one party, does not import certainty of obligation. In answering that question it is necessary not to demand unrealistic precision. As McHugh JA said in Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 (at 11,118): '... in an ongoing relationship, it is not always easy to point to the precise moment when the legal criteria of a contract have been fulfilled. Agreements concerning terms and conditions which might be too uncertain or too illusory to enforce at a particular time in the relationship may by reason of the parties' subsequent conduct become sufficiently specific to give rise to legal rights and duties. In a dynamic commercial relationship new terms will be added or will supersede older terms. It is necessary therefore to look at the whole relationship and not only at what was said and done when the relationship was first formed.' See Brambles Nationwide Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at 177 (Heydon JA) and Nationwide Produce Holdings Pty Ltd v Linknarf Limited (2005) Aust Contract Reports 90-424 at 88,509 (Tamberlin J). In Vroon BV v Fosters Brewing Group Ltd (1994) 2 VR 32, Ormiston J accepted that: '... in commercial transactions the court should strive to give effect to the expressed arrangements and expectations of those engaged in business notwithstanding that there are areas of uncertainty and notwithstanding that particular terms have been omitted or not fully worked out.'"
Case16599,cited,De Silva v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 89 FCR 502,"summary, delegated legislation may be held invalid because it is an unreasonable exercise of the empowering provision or because the delegated legislation is not reasonably proportionate to the purposes of the empowering provision. There is considerable overlap between the two grounds of review (see De Silva v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 89 FCR 502 at 510) ("" De Silva v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ""). As the Court does not have authority to conduct merits review, the test in the case of each ground of review is a very demanding one and, in the final analysis, involves a question of whether the delegated legislation represents a real exercise of the power in the empowering section. Cases in which delegated legislation has been held invalid on either ground of review are rare. Examples of cases in which regulations under the Act have been held invalid on the unreasonableness ground are Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77 and Li v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1147 ; (1999) 94 FCR 219. Examples of cases in which delegated legislation has been held invalid on the reasonable proportionality ground of review are Re Gold Coast City Council By-laws [1994] 1 Qd R 130 , Paradise Projects Pty Ltd v Gold Coast City Council [1994] 1 Qd R 314 , Re Gold Coast City (Touting and Distribution of Printed Matter) Law 1994 (1995) 86 LGREA 288 and House v Forestry Tasmania [1995] TASSC 95 ; (1995) 5 Tas R 169. Before leaving this brief review of the cases, I refer to the illuminating discussions of the relevant principles in De Silva v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Vanstone v Clark [2005] FCAFC 189 ; (2005) 147 FCR 299 at 331-343 [99] - [160] per Weinberg J.

Case16437,cited,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592,"The next step in the appellant's proposed challenge was premised upon what are said to be findings made by his Honour that the Tribunal did take account of inconsistencies between his visa application statement and his oral evidence, notwithstanding it disclaimed so doing. I will return to these findings below. What is contended is that because the Tribunal relied upon those inconsistencies in reaching its decision it was, as I noted above, obliged to put the inconsistencies to the appellant either as a matter of procedural fairness or because, in the circumstances it was required to do so by s 425 of the Act as explained in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at [33] - [36] . 30 By way of background to my consideration of that contention, I should refer to aspects of the provisions of s 422B , s 424A and s 425. Section 422B(1) of the Act provided at the relevant time: "" Exhaustive statement of natural justice hearing rule (1) This Division is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matter it deals with."" 31 Section 424A provided, insofar as presently relevant: "" Applicant must be given certain information (1) Subject to subsection (3), the Tribunal must: (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; ... (3) This section does not apply to information: ... (b) that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application."" 36 In SZBEL , the High Court commented of s 425 (at [33]-[36]) that: ""[33] The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the tribunal. The applicant is to be invited 'to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review '. The reference to 'the issues arising in relation to the decision under review' is important. [34] Those issues will not be sufficiently identified in every case by describing them simply as whether the applicant is entitled to a protection visa. The statutory language 'arising in relation to the decision under review' is more particular. The issues arising in relation to a decision under review are to be identified having regard not only to the fact that the tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions conferred by the Act on the original decision-maker (here, the minister's delegate), but also to the fact that the tribunal is to review that particular decision, for which the decision-maker will have given reasons. [35] The tribunal is not confined to whatever may have been the issues that the delegate considered. The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the tribunal. But if the tribunal takes no steps to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive, and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is, the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are 'the issues arising in relation to the decision under review'. That is why the point at which to begin the identification of issues arising in relation to the decision under review will usually be the reasons given for that decision. And unless some other additional issues are identified by the tribunal (as they may be), it would ordinarily follow that, on review by the tribunal, the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the applicant. [36] It is also important to recognise that the invitation to an applicant to appear before the tribunal to give evidence and make submissions is an invitation that need not be extended if the tribunal considers that it should decide the review in the applicant's favour. Ordinarily then, as was the case here, the tribunal will begin its interview of an applicant who has accepted the tribunal's invitation to appear, knowing that it is not persuaded by the material already before it to decide the review in the applicant's favour. That lack of persuasion may be based on particular questions the tribunal has about specific aspects of the material already before it; it may be based on nothing more particular than a general unease about the veracity of what is revealed in that material. But unless the tribunal tells the applicant something different, the applicant would be entitled to assume that the reasons given by the delegate for refusing to grant the application will identify the issues that arise in relation to that decision."""
Case13457,cited,Repatriation Commission v Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 ; (2002) 69 ALD 581,"applicant did argue before the Tribunal that his underlying condition had been aggravated by his employment in the sense contemplated by the definitions in s 4 of the Act. The argument was not developed much but this does not detract from the fact that the argument was put. The Tribunal was obliged to turn its mind to the argument and to deal with the question of aggravation. It was a significant part of the applicant's case before the Tribunal. The argument was seriously advanced by the applicant and was worthy of serious consideration. Whilst it is true that the Tribunal is not required to consider and address every submission made to it, serious submissions of the type to which I have just alluded must be addressed ( Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 79 ALR 267 at 276 277 per Jenkinson J). It is an error of law for the Tribunal not to consider such a submission and not to reveal its consideration of that submission in its Reasons for Decision (see Hartnett v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2004] FCA 50 at [50] ; and Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 ; (2008) 245 ALR 561 at [88] [89] (pp 579 480)). This statement of principle is consistent with the more general statements of principle directed to giving content to the concept of error of law made by the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 ; (2002) 69 ALD 581 at [59] (pp 597 598)."

Case17211,applied,George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 140,"The applicant further relied on George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 (' Rockett ') at 116: 'The objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something need to point more clearly to the subject matter of the belief, but that is not to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the balance of probabilities that the subject matter in fact occurred or exists: the assent of belief is given on more slender evidence than proof. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of the mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture.' 20 CASA submitted that, in deciding whether grounds are 'reasonable', emphasis is to be given to the primacy of the maintenance, enhancement and promotion of air safety, with particular emphasis on prevention of accidents and incidents. The applicant further contended that the establishment of those grounds, though objective, contemplates a reasonable person in the position of CASA, as is apparent from the reference in s 30DE(3) to ss 3A and 9A(1). 21 The principal proposition advanced by the respondents is that it cannot be the case that all that is required is 'reasonable grounds to believe' without taking account of any rebuttal evidence, as such a test would result in CASA's application being successful every time. 22 As to what is involved in 'reasonable grounds for a belief', the passage cited from Rockett is obiter as to belief because that case concerned suspicion. In any case, the respondents said that the High Court really decided in Rockett that 'reasonable grounds for believing' '[r]equires the existence of facts sufficient to induce' an actual belief (at 112-3), so that, to discharge its legal onus, while the applicant does not need to prove on the balance of probabilities that the take-offs at Innamincka constituted a serious and imminent risk to air safety, it must nevertheless prove facts sufficient to induce a belief in that proposition. 25 I do not accept that the establishment of the reasonable grounds for the necessary belief necessarily contemplates a reasonable person in the position of CASA . The point of the requisite approach to the Court is clearly to enable the Court to decide on all the materials before it, whether, objectively, there are reasonable grounds for the requisite belief. The Court is to adjudicate that matter, not CASA. It is not a mere question of considering whether CASA's view was such that no reasonable person could hold it. The Court is to form its own view of what are reasonable grounds for belief. So, the question is: regardless of whether or not there was in fact a serious and imminent risk to air safety, are reasonable grounds shown to the Court's satisfaction to induce an actual belief that there was such a risk? As the High Court said in Rockett (at [116]): 'Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of the mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture.' 26 Whereas the fact of such a risk need not be established, it will not, on the other hand, be sufficient to show reasonable grounds for a mere suspicion, even a serious suspicion, that there was a risk of the relevant kind. 27 If the judge is moved by all the evidence to conclude that there was in fact such a risk, it will follow that there were reasonable grounds for that belief. If not, the judge must consider whether, nevertheless, there are, in the judge's opinion, reasonable grounds for so believing."
Case13745,cited,Lei Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568,"In his Statement of Reasons, the Minister refers to the children cumulatively, singling out only one child (Darryl Holani). This in itself would not necessarily mean that the Minister has not taken into account the best interests of each of the applicant's children, in particular Larni and Joshua as submitted by the applicant, if the reasons of the Minister indicated that their interests had been taken into account: cf Mason CJ and Deane J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 292; Burchett J in Vaitaiki v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1998) 150 ALR 608 at 614, Lei Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 at [283] . Primary consideration 23 The key issue in this case is whether, in making findings concerning the best interests of Larni and Joshua, the Minister has in fact given the best interests of the children ""proper, genuine and realistic consideration"" (Branson J in Vaitaiki 150 ALR at 631; Branson, North and Stone JJ in Lei Wan [2001] FCA 568 at [34] ). Material before the Minister 30 In my view this not a case where the interests of Larni and Joshua are ""dismissed with...almost perfunctory curtness"" (cf Burchett J in Vaitaiki 150 ALR at 614). Further, this is not a case where the Minister has failed to identify anywhere in his Statement of Reasons what the best interests of the children indicated that he should decide with respect to the applicant's visa (cf Branson, North and Stone JJ in Lei Wan [2001] FCA 568 at [26] - [27] ): the Minister clearly stated that the best interests of the children required that the applicant's visa not be cancelled. The only real information of relevance before the Minister concerning Larni and Joshua other than their ages concerned their close relationship with their father and the support he provided them, and this issue was clearly taken into account."

The other documents fitting this description of being executed ""contemporaneously"" include the documents listed in [19] above as having been executed on 14 December 1994.

The relevant question was about whether the Tribunal's processes, not its actual decision, were in accordance with law. 21 Here, there is not the slightest doubt that Mr Goo gave to the Tribunal for the purpose of his application for review the information in the website printout of 2 May 2005.

Case16977,cited,Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 207 ,"The respondent also failed in proceedings in this Court by which he had sought to set aside the bankruptcy notice. This culminated in the dismissal of his appeal to the Full Court in December 2007: Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 207. 16 On 12 November 2007 the respondent's solicitors wrote to the AAT requesting it to reinstate the AAT proceedings abandoned by the respondent in 2005. This was shortly after the Court of Appeal dismissed the respondent's appeal against the decision refusing an extension of time within which to appeal. The Tribunal has yet to make a decision whether to reinstate the proceedings. The applicant has opposed the application for reinstatement. 17 Since then the respondent has filed a further application in the AAT. The application is to extend time for lodging an application for review of a decision. It concerns the sum of $9,375 which forms a part of the respondent's taxable income for the year ended 30 June 1998 and which was the subject of the amended tax assessment issued on 23 November 2000. It is yet to be determined. 50 The amount of $16,800 is included in the amount of $33,456 contained at item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice. That figure also includes two other amounts according to an affidavit sworn by Nola Kathryn Rice, a public service employee with the ATO: Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 207 at [10] . The respondent acknowledges this in his affidavit sworn 6 May 2008. The amounts are set out under para [13] above. There was no reason, in my view, for the applicant to think that para [36] was directed to an overcharge of general interest charges related to seven of the garnishee payments totalling $7,350 allegedly made prior to the date of judgment. 51 Further, in my opinion, nothing in para [36] would have alerted the applicant to the matter of the PAYG payments."
Case6206,cited,E v Australian Red Cross Society (1991) 27 FCR 310,"In Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc (1996) 70 FCR 403, Hill J at 407 pointed out that, for the purposes of enlivening the Court's power to control access to certain documentation under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the ""hearing of a proceeding"" could extend to a directions hearing or an interlocutory process. See also E v Australian Red Cross Society (1991) 27 FCR 310. That view is reflected in, and consistent with, the definition of ""hearing"" in O1 r 4 of the Rules, namely that ""hearing includes any hearing before the Court, whether final or interlocutory, and whether in open court or in chambers"". Order 10, referring to the Court's powers at a directions hearing, apparently uses the term ""hearing"" in r 1(2)(c) in a somewhat more confined sense as a hearing in which the Court proposes to perform an adjudicative function (not necessarily a final adjudication). Order 30 r 1(2)(a) uses the term ""trial"" to include any interlocutory hearing. In Martin v Abbott Australasia Pty Ltd [1981] 2 NSWLR 430, Hunt J at 434-436 regarded an appeal ""after a trial or a hearing on the merits"" as including to an appeal from an interlocutory hearing. A similar conclusion was reached by Anderson J in Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works v Bevelon Investments Pty Ltd [1977] VR 473 at 475-477."
Case10208,applied,Star Industrial Company Ltd v Yap Kwee Kor [1976] FSR 256,"off is a remedy for the invasion of a right of property in the business or goodwill likely to be injured by misrepresentations made by the passing off of one person's goods as those of another: Star Industrial Company Ltd v Yap Kwee Kor [1976] FSR 256 at 269; Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v Next Publishing Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 625 at [25] , [2005] FCA 625 ; 222 ALR 127 at 135 per Tamberlin J. It is not a remedy for the invasion of a right of property in a mark, name or get-up which has been improperly used. Nor is it, unlike s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , designed to protect consumers."
Case12666,considered,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pauls Ltd [1999] FCA 1750,"Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pauls Ltd [1999] FCA 1750 at [10] , with reference to sentiments to that effect then recently expressed by Wilcox J in Coshott v Kam Tou Mak [1998] FCA 147 , O'Loughlin J observed that there was a contemporary tendency against the taking of a pedantic approach to a pleading. A decade later that remains the case. Further, a pleading must be read as a whole. The countervailing consideration is whether, accepting it must be so read, the pleading fairly puts the other party on notice as to the case to be met. A pleading is but a means to the achievement of procedural fairness and of the efficient use of judicial resources and those of the parties by the identification of what is truly at issue."
Case15124,cited,Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1995) 57 FCR 119,"My attention was drawn by counsel for the respondent to Order 62 Rule 4(2)(c), and to the observations of von Doussa J in Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1995) 57 FCR 119 concerning the evident purpose of the Court's power to make costs orders of the kind here presently sought by the respondent, that being to avoid an ongoing counter productive dispute, in the interests of achieving finality, subject always to the need to ensure that unreasonable amounts of costs are not pursued and awarded. I have not approached the task of assessment akin to that of a detailed 'taxation', which cannot sensibly be the judicial task set by the Court Rules, but rather from the perspective of an overview of the nature and extent of the relating broad issues which fell upon me for resolution, being misconceived issues nevertheless of some complexity, raised unsuccessfully by the applicants for resolution at the final hearing of the proceedings. I refer of course to what appears in the detailed reasons apparent in my reasons for judgment of 20 December 2004. 15 Judgment should clearly enough be entered in principle in favour of the respondent and thus adversely to the applicants, in relation to the totality of its legal costs reasonably incurred. My conspectus of the amount of those costs, broadly undertaken in the light of the nature and extent of the issues raised by the applicants in the principal proceedings, leaves little room for any reasonable quantum of adjustment downwards of the assessment of professional costs and disbursements which has been assembled in the material in evidence before me. Adopting a broad approach generally in line with that taken by von Doussa J in Beach Petroleum , albeit that the size of the proceedings there involved was incomparable to that litigated before me, yet nevertheless taking into account the degree of complexity of the proceedings occasioned by the purported issues raised by the applicants, I would assess the costs and disbursements of the respondent broadly in the sum of $20,400 inclusive of counsel's fees, that sum being of course not far short of the total amount claimed, but nevertheless taking into account the respondent's concession. In reaching that figure, I have also considered the submissions of the applicants contained in their notice of objections to the respondent's bill of costs, those being the only submissions before me from the applicants on the costs sought. 16 That leaves unresolved the costs of the present interlocutory proceedings commenced by the respondent by notice of motion filed on 21 October 2005, in relation to which, as I have already recorded, there was no appearance by the applicants. The conduct of the applicants since the conclusion of the hearing, which I have briefly outlined, renders it inevitable that a further adverse order as to the costs of the present application must be made in principle in favour of the respondent, as is sought in its notice of motion filed on 21 October 2005. I say ' in principle ' for the further reason that it is traditional for a successful party to receive on taxation, an award of costs and disbursements incurred in the course of the taxation process, and it was I think reasonable in the circumstances for the respondent to have sought recourse to Order 62 rule 4(2). I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.

Case3886,distinguished,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Commercial and General Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 1349,"The applicant referred in its submissions to the finding of the Full Court in Griffiths [2006] FCAFC 196 ; 157 FCR 112 and a number of cases to which reference was made by the Full Court in Griffiths 157 FCR at 116, namely: &#8226; Holder v Searle (1998) 44 IPR 1 &#8226; Brimaud v Boston Securities Entertainment Investments Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 1392 &#8226; Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 144 ALR 458 &#8226; Inn Leisure Industries Pty Ltd (Provisional liquidator appointed) v DF McCloy Pty Ltd (No 1) (1991) 28 FCR 151 &#8226; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Commercial and General Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 1349. 21 Further, in relation to the other cases cited by the applicant, as the Full Court observed in Griffiths 157 FCR at 116: &#8226; in Holder v Searle 44 IPR 1 where the prosecution failed in two of the three informations it proffered against the defendant, and was only partially successful in respect of the remaining information, Spender J ordered that the prosecutor pay one-third of the defendant's costs &#8226; in Brimaud [1998] FCA 1392 where the applicant was successful in one of three claims against the respondents, and in respect of one of the unsuccessful claims the extent to which the length of the case was increased by the conduct of that issue was not insignificant, Emmett J ordered that the respondents pay 15% of the applicant's costs of the proceedings &#8226; in Esso 144 ALR 458 where the taxpayer's success overall was slight, Sundberg J made a broad-brush global order as to costs, determining that the taxpayer should pay five-sixths of the respondent's costs, and the respondent one-sixth of the taxpayer's costs &#8226; in Inn Leisure Industries 28 FCR 151 the applicant succeeded in one of three claims, however the Court considered in the circumstances of the case that the applicant should recover three-quarters of the costs of the application &#8226; in ACCC v Commercial and General Publications [2002] FCA 1349 , Heerey J observed that three-quarters of the trial was taken up with charges which were dismissed, and awarded the defendant half its costs."
Case20024,followed,Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 425,"The right of any suitor to approach a court of justice is a fundamental right in a free society. The right is protected by the power of the court to commit persons who interfere with that right for contempt. In Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 425 at 436 Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: 'In Raymond v Honey Lord Bridge of Harwich stated that ([1983] 1 AC 1 at 14) a citizen's right to unimpeded access to the courts can only be taken away by express enactment.' 16 This court has proceedings initiated in it either by the filing of either an application and affidavit or an application and a statement of claim. The rules of the court have been devised in a way that ensures that its processes are transparent. Where it is necessary to prevent persons knowing of the bases upon which the court has had its jurisdiction invoked, O 46 r 6(1) enables a judge to decide that material is truly confidential and ought not otherwise to be made available."
Case3698,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151,decision-maker engaged in determining whether an APS employee has breached the Code of Conduct has no general obligation to initiate inquiries or to make out a case for an APS employee in Mr Lohse's position. It is only in rare or exceptional circumstances that a decision-maker's failure to inquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure may render the ensuing decision manifestly unreasonable in the sense used in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223 ('Wednesbury') (See Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 ('Le')) or may allow a conclusion that there was a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction on the part of the decision-maker (see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 at [24]-[26]). For there to be a finding of jurisdictional error in this regard one would need to find a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact. Le was a case where the circumstances were rare or exceptional. In Le reliance had been placed by the Refugee Review Tribunal upon a transcript of a five and a half hour interview which had been recorded on seven only pages of notes. Kenny J referred to the fact that there had been a mistranslation which meant that the significance of the primary decision-maker's decision record and the typed notes of interview were doubtful or uncertain in a number of critical respects. The mistranslation raised several uncertainties.
Case15900,referred to,Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd [1894] AC 535,"In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to address a further argument put by Graphix Labels and Mr Atta against implying such a term and that was that such a term would amount to an unreasonable restraint of trade. I was referred to Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd [1894] AC 535; Amoco Australia Pty Ltd v Rocca Bros Motor Engineering Co Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 40 ; (1973) 133 CLR 288. Of course, there have been a number of cases dealing with the common law doctrine of restraint of trade since those two cases (see, for example, the discussion in Seddon and Ellinghaus, Cheshire &amp; Fifoot's Law of Contract (8 th Australian ed, 2002) pages 860-863)."
Case25074,cited,Basma v Weekes [1950] AC 441,"In the present case there was no qualification made by Dartbrook as to the capacity in which it contracted. The knowledge of a third party of the existence of the principal is not sufficient to excuse an agent from liability: Stanley Yeung Kai Yung v Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation [1981] AC 787 at 795. To do otherwise would permit oral evidence to contradict the written agreement: Basma v Weekes [1950] AC 441 at 451. In the present case there is nothing to suggest that the parties intended that Dartbrook not be liable as charterer. Even if one were to have regard to Hyundai MM's state of knowledge, it could not be assumed that it understood Dartbrook was not intended to have that liability. It merely knew that it was acting for the joint venture in connexion with its sale."
Case19524,referred to,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"applicant then referred to decisions which have considered whether various grounds in s 5 of the ADJR Act embody a ""no evidence"" or ""no probative material"" test.

Case21191,followed,WAAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399,"The requirement imposed by Rule 15(2) that there be "" special reasons "" is a requirement imposing a flexible discretionary power: Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187. Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ there observed at 195 : It is useful to consider the meaning and application of r 15(2) against a background of an understanding of how other courts have applied corresponding rules. But in the end, this Court must construe and apply the terms of its own rule. The question is what that rule means, and how it is to be applied to the circumstances of the case. It is clear that the rule reflects the same general structure exemplified by the various decisions we have discussed -- the provision of a time for lodgment of an appeal, but the provision also of a discretion to permit an appeal out of time where it is shown that the circumstances warrant the exercise of that discretion. As Lord Guest, speaking for the Privy Council, put it in Ratnam v Cumarasamy [1965] 1 WLR 8 at 12: ""The rules of court must prima facie be obeyed and in order to justify a court in extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to be taken, there must be some material on which the court can exercise its discretion. If the law were otherwise, a party in breach would have an unqualified right to an extension of time which would defeat the purpose of the rules which is to provide a time table for the conduct of litigation."" What is needed to justify an extension of time is indicated in r 15(2) by the words ""for special reasons"". It is that there be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed, though filed after the expiry of twenty-one days. In that context, the expression ""special reasons"" is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty-one days. But it may be so distinguished (not necessarily will, for the rule gives a discretion) wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary. We do not think the use of the expression ""for special reasons"" implies something narrower than this. The discretion to extend time is given for the purpose of enabling the Court to do justice between the parties: WAAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at [7] per Lee, Nicholson and Finkelstein JJ."

Case14961,applied,Flexible Steel Lacing Co v Beltreco Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331,"The parties are not in dispute as to the applicable principles which have been the subject of frequent discussion in the decisions of this Court: see, for instance, Flexible Steel Lacing Co v Beltreco Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331 (' Beltreco '); PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2005) 64 IPR 314 (' Photocure '); Sachtler GMBH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 373 (' Sachtler '). While it may be useful for me to set out some of the relevant principles I shall do so only briefly. 15 The ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument are applicable to the construction of the specification of a patent: Nobel's Explosives Co Ltd v Anderson (1894) 11 RPC 519 at 523; D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 (' D&eacute;cor ') at 391, 400; Photocure at [168]. However, there are also a number of special considerations that are relevant to the construction of a patent. The general basis for these rules was explained by Hely J in Beltreco at [70]: 'A patent is a public instrument which grants the right to protection of a defined monopoly, for the consideration of the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society. It is the need for balance between these symbiotic, yet competing interests which underscores the rules of patent construction.' 16 It is well established that the claims contained in the specification set out the legal limits of the monopoly. Yet, when construing the claims and determining the nature and extent of this monopoly it is necessary to consider the context in which the claims are made. This requires a consideration of the specification as a whole even if there is no apparent ambiguity in the claim; Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf (Australia) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 (' Minnesota Mining ') at 267-272; D&eacute;cor at 410-411; Beltreco at [75]-[78]. The specification is made up of several parts which have different functions: Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 (' Welch Perrin ') at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Beltreco at [73]. Nevertheless, reference to it as a whole may explain or elucidate the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of a technical term or in resolving ambiguities in the construction of claims: Martin v Scribal Pty Ltd [1954] HCA 48 ; (1954) 92 CLR 17 (' Martin ') per Taylor J at 97; Welch Perrin at 610-611; Electric &amp; Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd (1939) 56 RPC 23 (' Electric &amp; Musical Industries ') at 41-42, Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 (' Interlego ') at 478-479; D&eacute;cor at 400; Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd v Koukourou &amp; Partners Pty Ltd (1994) 30 IPR 479 (' Sartas ') at 486; Beltreco at [75]. 17 It is important, however, that the focus of the inquiry remain on the claims under consideration. If claims are clear and unambiguous, they are not to be varied, qualified or made obscure by statements found in other parts of the patent: Welch Perrin at 610; Interlego at 478-479; Electric &amp; Musical Industries at 41; Rosedale Associated Manufacturers Ltd v Carlton Tyre Saving Co Ltd [1960] RPC 59 at 69; Cooper Industries Inc v Metal Manufactures Ltd (1994) 29 IPR 106 at 113; Lantech Inc v First Green Park Pty Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 327 at 333; Beltreco at [74]. It is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of the monopoly as fixed by the words of the claims by adding to those words a gloss drawn from other parts of the specification: Welch Perrin at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Braas &amp; Co GmbH v Humes Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 273 at 284; Beltreco at [74]. 18 A patent specification should be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction: Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 (' Catnic ') at 242-243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Improver Corporation v Remington Consumer Products Ltd [1990] FSR 181 (' Improver '); Nicaro Holdings Pty Ltd v Martin Engineering Co (1989-1990) 16 IPR 545 at 560-561; Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd v M W A Holdings Pty Ltd (1970) 44 ALJR 385 at 388; Beltreco at [81]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoeschst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 (' Kirin-Amgen '); Sachtler at [43]-[67]. It is inappropriate, however, to approach construction of the specification with a view to being 'fair' to the patentee; Kirin-Amgen at [33]; Sachtler at [60]. The fact that the monopoly is granted in consideration for the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society must be recognised: Beltreco at [70]. Indeed, the principles governing a definition of a monopoly operating over the public at large require a description of the claims that 'is not reasonably capable of misunderstanding': Martin at 59. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct prohibited: British United Shoe Machinery Co Ltd v A Fussell &amp; Sons Ltd (1908) 25 RPC 631 at 650-651. The public are entitled to be able to design around the monopoly claimed in a patent and therefore they must be able to determine reliably the scope of the claims: Beloit Technologies Inc v Valmat Paper Machinery Inc [1895] 24 RPC 705 at 720. 20 The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date: Welch Perrin at 610; Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 (' Populin ') at 476-477; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 103 ALR 239 at 260; D&eacute;cor at 397; Stanway Oyster Cylinders Pty Ltd v Marks (1996) 66 FCR 577 at 582-583; Beltreco at [81]; Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at [24] ; Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care South East Asia Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 442 at [113]; Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 477 at 496; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 513 (' NV Philips ') at 531; Catnic at 225; Wheatley (Davina) v Drillsafe Ltd [2001] RPC 7 at 141 142. Thus, the words used in a specification are to be given the meaning that the hypothetical addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: D&eacute;cor at 391; Photocure at [170]. 25 A feature of a claim is considered essential if the hypothetical reader (that is, a reader skilled in the art before the priority date) would have understood from the language used in the claim, in the context of the specification as a whole, that the patentee intended that strict compliance was an essential requirement of the invention: Catnic at 243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Populin at 476; Beltreco at [81]."
Case1367,cited,Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342).

Case3961,considered,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002; Appellant S106/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 77 ALJR 1165,"Any assessment of the impact, in terms of an apprehended bias challenge, of the Tribunal's treatment of the Hospital Document and the Labour Reform Camp Document must be guided by the cautionary note sounded by McHugh and Gummow JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 ; Appellant S106/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at 1174, [49]. ""[49] In a dispute adjudicated by adversarial procedures, it is not unknown for a party's credibility to have been so weakened in cross-examination that the tribunal of fact may well treat what is proffered as corroborative evidence as of no weight because the well has been poisoned beyond redemption. It cannot be irrational for a decision-maker, enjoined by statute to apply inquisitorial processes (as here), to proceed on the footing that no corroboration can undo the consequences for a case put by a party of a conclusion that that case comprises lies by that party. If the critical passage in the reasons of the Tribunal be read as indicated above, the Tribunal is reasoning that, because the appellant cannot be believed, it cannot be satisfied with the alleged corroboration. The appellant's argument in this Court then has to be that it was irrational for the Tribunal to decide that the appellant had lied without, at that earlier stage, weighing the alleged corroborative evidence by the witness in question. That may be a preferable method of going about the task presented by s430 of the Act. But it is not irrational to focus first upon the case as it was put by the appellant."" (Emphasis added) 59 On one view of matters, that is all that the Tribunal has done here. It is possible to discern differences of detail in respect of an event or experience both within the applicant's evidence at the Tribunal hearing and as between that evidence and that given in other material submitted either with the initial protection visa application or later. Such differences certainly could provide a basis for a finding about the applicant's credibility and an affording of no weight to seemingly corroborative documents. In relation to the apprehended bias challenge, the factors are certainly not all one way. 60 Yet the Tribunal's findings concerning the credibility of the applicant's account have themselves been influenced by comparison with inferences that the Tribunal drew from an inspection of the Hospital Document and the Labour Reform Camp Document. This interplay in my opinion distinguishes the present case from the position described by McHugh and Gummow JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 in the passage quoted above. 61 The Tribunal rightly acknowledged, explicitly, that the general information that it had from the Australian Embassy concerning document fraud in China did not mean that all documents from that country were fraudulent. Possession of such information reasonably puts any administrator on guard, but nothing more than that, in relation to particular documents. 62 The Tribunal's perception of the genuineness of the applicant's account of his beating at the hands of the police, as well as of the Hospital Document itself, was expressed to be influenced by the fact that this document did not state a cause for the injury. That is true, but the Tribunal had no material before it as to whether it was the usual practice in this or any such Chinese hospital to record a cause, especially when this would record an injury inflicted on a citizen at the hands of State officials."
Case21029,cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Ibrahim [2000] HCA 55 ; (2000) 204 CLR 1,"The notion of 'systematic conduct' was referred to in Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 62 ; (1989) 169 CLR 379, at 429-430, per McHugh J. As McHugh J observed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Ibrahim [2000] HCA 55 ; (2000) 204 CLR 1, at [95], the use of this expression proved somewhat unfortunate in that some RRT decisions read it as meaning that there can be no persecution for the purposes of the Convention unless there has been a systematic course of conduct by the oppressor. McHugh J made it clear in Ibrahim that that had not been his meaning. Rather, he intended the expression to be a synonym for 'non-random'. McHugh J also said this (at [99]): ' It is an error to suggest that the use of the expression ""systematic conduct"" in ... Chan was intended to require, as a matter of law, that an applicant had to fear organised or methodical conduct, akin to the atrocities committed by the Nazis in the Second World War. Selective harassment, which discriminates against a person for a Convention reason, is inherent in the notion of persecution. Unsystematic or random acts are non-selective. It is therefore not a prerequisite to obtaining refugee status that a person fears being persecuted on a number of occasions or ""must show a series of co-ordinated acts directed at him or her which can be said to be not isolated but systematic"". The fear of a single act of harm done for a Convention reason will satisfy the Convention definition of persecution if it is so oppressive that the individual cannot be expected to tolerate it so that refusal to return to the country of the applicant's nationality is the understandable choice of that person. ' [Citations omitted.] 26 In the present case, the RRT used the expression 'a course of systematic conduct', or its equivalent, on three separate occasions. On each occasion, the RRT cited the observations of McHugh J in Chan . Of course, the RRT's decision in the present case was handed down long before the clarification of the law in Ibrahim ."
Case24364,cited,Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679,"referred to cl 10 at [18] above. Clause 10 was as follows: The Licensor or their agent shall sell the seed or product delivered to it by the grower (or otherwise subject to this agreement) via the payment schedule as per attachment. Clause 10 appears to be a promise by AAC to ICM that AAC or Namoi will sell seed and product delivered to ""it"" by ICM ""via the payment schedule as per attached"". It is common ground that at least the form of the Commercial Crop Contract was attached. There is a sort of payment schedule in cl 4 of the Commercial Crop Contract. That clause listed ""Guaranteed Minimum Prices"" promised to ICM as the grower. It appears that either AAC was, through its agent Namoi, a party to the Commercial Crop Contract as a principal whose existence and identity were not disclosed on the face of that document, or at least the agent Namoi entered into the Commercial Crop Contract in its own right but AAC approved of its doing so as the necessary and contemplated means of implementing the Grower's Licence. Even on the latter basis, it is arguable that AAC was bound by Mr Young's conduct on behalf of Namoi in the discussion on 29 May 2003. The date fixed for completion of the Commercial Crop Contract, 30 June 2003, was not intended to be of the essence of that contract. I mean that ICM was not entitled immediately following 30 June to terminate the contractual relationship for Namoi's failure to pay on that date. This is demonstrated by the second and last sentences of cl 3(c). The whole of cl 3(c) is as follows: Subject to normal seasonal conditions, delivery and payment under this contract is to be completed prior to 30 June 2003. If due to extraneous circumstances by either party that this contract is not completed by this date then mediation with regards to settlement terms must occur. A suggestion is that if the Grower is deemed to be at fault they would not charge the Licensor carry (storage) from this date and the credit limit in place would be renegotiated. If the Licensor is deemed to be at fault then a negotiated percentage of the balance of the products to be paid at this date. The present case concerns an assignment of a bare cause of action for unliquidated damages for breach of contract, not of a property right to which a cause of action is ancillary. The parties accepted that in these circumstances the assignment could be sustained only if Mr Young had a genuine commercial interest in taking the assignment and enforcing it for his own benefit: see Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 703, which has been followed in many cases in Australia including, but not limited to, Re Timothy's Pty Ltd and the Companies Act [1981] 2 NSWLR 706; Commonwealth v Ling (1993) 44 FCR 397 ; National Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1995) 132 ALR 514 ; and see G Tolhurst, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006) at [6.59]ff . The circumstances of the present case are analogous to those in Monk in which the assignee's interest was that of obtaining a set-off against a judgment debt. In that case, Cohen J said (at 153): The plaintiff's only apparent interest is in the possibility of his becoming a creditor of the Bank. That is, his interest is in using the debt which might arise from the cause of action for his personal benefit. That no doubt is the interest of any assignee. The using of the debt as a set-off against the judgment debt is merely an example of obtaining some personal benefit. In that regard the plaintiff is in no stronger position than he would be if he had obtained an assignment of a cause of action for negligence by a customer of the Bank who claimed to have suffered injuries arising from unsafe premises. In the authorities where the Trendtex test has been applied, the commercial interest has gone beyond a mere personal interest in profiting from the outcome of the proceedings and has required an interest by the assignee in the assignor or its business affairs or activities which the assignment may in some way protect. These observations are applicable, mutatis mutandis , to the present case."

Case13816,considered,Petrusevski v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Ltd [2003] FCA 61,"33H deals with the content of the originating process whereby a representative proceeding is commenced. That section provides as follows: Originating process (1) An application commencing a representative proceeding, or a document filed in support of such an application, must, in addition to any other matters required to be included: (a) describe or otherwise identify the group members to whom the proceeding relates; and (b) specify the nature of the claims made on behalf of the group members and the relief claimed; and (c) specify the questions of law or fact common to the claims of the group members. (2) In describing or otherwise identifying group members for the purposes of subsection (1), it is not necessary to name, or specify the number of, the group members. Order 73 r 3 of the Federal Court Rules further provides that a representative proceeding "" must be commenced by filing an application in accordance with Form 129 "". That form is framed by reference to s 33H(1)(a), (b) and (c): Bailey v Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Ltd [2007] FCA 1664 at [9] . Amongst the other requirements imposed by s 33H, s 33H(1)(a) requires the "" group members "" to be clearly identified: Auskay International Manufacturing and Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 at [27] , [2008] FCA 1458 ; 251 ALR 166 at 175 per Tracey J. In an attempt to give greater clarification as to what is required by s 33H(1)(a), Sackville J in Petrusevski v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Ltd [2003] FCA 61 observed: [19] In determining what s 33H(1)(a) of the Federal Court Act requires, it is important to consider why it is necessary to describe or identify the group members in a representative proceeding. One reason, as the High Court observed in Wong v Silkfield , is to enable the Court to determine whether the requirements of s 33C have been satisfied. Unless the group member is adequately described or identified (although not necessarily named or counted: s 33H(2)), it may be difficult to ascertain, for example, whether the claims of all the group members give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact. [Emphasis in original] [20] Another reason for describing or identifying group members is to enable group members to decide whether or not to opt out of the representative proceeding pursuant to s 33J(2) of the Federal Court Act . If a person who is a group member does not opt out of the proceedings he or she will be bound by the judgment. (Section 33ZB requires the judgment in a representative proceeding to ""describe or otherwise identify the group members who will be affected by it""and provides that the judgment binds any such persons other than any person who has opted out.) The failure by a group member to opt out of representative proceedings may therefore be attended by serious consequences, although of course the litigation might also produce advantages for that group member. [21] These factors suggest that it must be possible for persons who may be within the represented group to ascertain from the pleadings whether they are in fact group members. The point was made by Hedigan J in Cook v Pasminco Ltd [2000] VSC 534 , at [59], in relation to similar State legislation: ""It is beyond doubt that in a group proceeding the description of a group membership must be such so that it is at least possible to determine who falls within the group as described. Persons contemplated as being within the group would themselves not understand whether they were within it, unless the definition of the group is intelligible, although not necessarily exact. Members of the group are entitled to know what constitutes the essentials of the group. A decision concerning opt-out cannot be sensibly made unless it is known what it is that is being opted out from."" It follows from his Honour's observations that a person must be able to ascertain from the description of the represented group whether he or she is a member of that group. ... [23] Clearly enough, not every description or identification of the represented group will satisfy the requirements of s 33H(1)(a) of the Federal Court Act . A useful, although not necessarily exhaustive test, is whether the description is such as to enable a person, with the assistance of a legal adviser if necessary, to ascertain whether he or she is a group member. If the description incorporates a reference to conduct alleged in the pleadings, a person or his or her adviser ought to be able, by reading the description and the relevant portion of the pleadings, to determine whether he or she is a member of the represented group. If a person cannot reasonably be expected to do this, the definition is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of s 33H(1)(a). In Wright Rubber Products Pty Ltd v Bayer AG [2008] FCA 1510 at [13] Tracey J referred to "" the need for precision in the framing of group definitions in representative proceedings "". In Johnstone v HIH Insurance Ltd [2004] FCA 190 at [52] Tamberlin J likewise said that ""... it is necessary to know with some precision who the group members are ""."
Case7024,applied,Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 ; (2009) 83 ALJR 951,"the High Court has had occasion to reflect upon the amendment of pleadings and case management principles in the context of litigation: see Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 ; (2009) 83 ALJR 951 (Aon Risk Services). One factor which, in my opinion, emerges from the judgments delivered in that case is that decisions in relation to whether or not to permit amendments ought to be informed not merely by the interests of the parties but also by a wider public interest. For example, at para 25, French CJ observed: Recognition of the public interest in the administration of civil justice procedures in Australia and the United Kingdom pre-dates the Woolf Report and its attendant reforms. In Dawson v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation , King CJ acknowledge the responsibility of judges to ensure, ""so far as possible and subject to overriding considerations of justice"", that the limited resources which the State commits to the administration of justice are not wasted by the failure of parties to adhere to trial dates of which they have had proper notice. In a late amendment case considered by the House of Lords in 1987, there was a marked departure from the approach of Bowen LJ in Cropper v Smith . Lord Griffiths required that judges considering amendments weigh in the balance: the pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in litigation and the consequent necessity that, in the interests of the whole community, legal business should be conducted efficiently. French CJ continued: The same indulgence could not be shown towards the negligent conduct of litigation as might have been possible in a ""more leisured age"". That approach was followed by Sheppard J in a revenue case heard in the Federal Court. And in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in GSA Industries , Samuels JA said that: the emollient effect of an order for costs as a panacea may now be consigned to the Aladdin's cave which Lord Reid rejected as one of the fairy tales in which we no longer believe. Accepting, as I do, that an appeal statement is not a pleading document, its purpose nonetheless is to serve the ends of justice by ensuring procedural fairness. At this late stage of a proceeding, and having regard to sentiments evident in Aon Risk Services , the purpose of Tax List directions and of case management generally, it seems to me that it would be procedurally unfair to permit the Commissioner to rely upon the appeal statement in its amended form. Especially that is so in light of the deliberate statement made in open court six months ago by reference to which the appellant taxpayer has cast its case. There is a further observation which I feel constrained to make, and that is in relation to the Commissioner's utilisation of, or attempted utilisation of, s 15 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) in relation to the conduct of serious revenue law litigation in this Court. Like any litigant, the Commissioner is entitled to appear in person. Section 15 also makes it plain that the intention is that the Commissioner may in writing authorise one of his officers to appear. In so doing, though, that officer is not clothed with all that a court is entitled to expect from a person on the roll of legal practitioners."
Case13453,cited,Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536,"Tribunal then returned to the concept of "" material contribution "". At this point in its reasons, it referred to and discussed the judgment of Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536. The Tribunal then concluded its Reasons with the following (at [60]): After considering all the evidence, in particular the possible factors that may have contributed to the onset or aggravation of the Applicant's psychiatric condition, we find that the circumstances of the Applicant's employment with Centrelink did not substantially contribute to his disease. Mr Nelson is not entitled to compensation pursuant to section 14 of the Act. It follows that he is not entitled to compensation in respect of medical expenses under section 16, nor is he entitled to compensation for incapacity under sections 19 , 20 , 21 or 21A of the Act. The only places that the concept of "" aggravation of an ailment "" were mentioned at all in the Tribunal's Reasons was at [5] (when s 4 of the Act was extracted) and at [60]. In the present case, in order to make good the contention concerning aggravation of an existing ailment which the applicant submits was advanced to the Tribunal, the applicant would need to demonstrate that, at the time he commenced his employment with Centrelink, he was suffering an ailment within the relevant definition and that that ailment was aggravated (ie made more severe) by his employment by Centrelink or that the aggravation was contributed to in a material degree by his employment by Centrelink. The notion of material contribution was explained by Finn J in Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; 156 FCR 536. In that case, his Honour concluded that, in order to assess whether the aggravation of an ailment was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment, the Court was obliged to evaluate all relevant contributing factors in order to determine whether the employment made a contribution which was more than a mere contributing factor. His Honour described the exercise as a matter of fact and degree ( Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; 156 FCR 536 at [16] (p 542 543)). The fundamental premise of the applicant's argument is that the Tribunal simply failed to address his case based upon alleged aggravation of an existing ailment (viz his underlying psychiatric condition). The Tribunal described the applicant's complaint at [1] of its Reasons as a complaint to the effect that his psychological condition was sustained because of his employment. That language tends to suggest that the Tribunal regarded the applicant's case as being confined to a case based upon the contention that he sustained an ailment as an employee of Centrelink, being an ailment that was contributed to in a material degree by Centrelink. The terms of the general formulation of the issue in [1] of the Tribunal's Reasons tend to suggest that the Tribunal did not regard aggravation of an existing ailment as being an alternative basis for the applicant's claims before it."
Case19937,referred to,Legione v Hateley [1983] HCA 11 ; (1983) 152 CLR 406,"PN relied on the words of Mason and Deane JJ in Legione v Hateley [1983] HCA 11 ; (1983) 152 CLR 406 ("" Legione "") at 430 to support the formulation of the third category. In the passage to which PN referred, their Honours said that estoppel in pais includes common law estoppel comprising conventional estoppel and estoppel by representation. They also said that it includes ""the overlapping equitable doctrines of proprietary estoppel and estoppel by acquiescence or encouragement"". 666 It follows from the description of estoppel in pais in Legione at 430 and from the three categories propounded by PN, that each of the categories put forward is a species of estoppel in pais. 667 Without endeavouring to discuss the many and varying observations that have been made in the cases, I will attempt to state the essential propositions which flow from the cases and which underlie the determination of the present proceedings. 668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:- (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 ("" Thompson "") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 ("" Grundt "") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an ""unjust"" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the ""narrower"" and ""broader"" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or ""real detriment"" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 ("" Con-Stan "") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- ""In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise."" (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 ("" Humphreys ""). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 ("" Mobil Oil "") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that ""a particular legal relationship"" or ""interest"" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- ""If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation."" (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 ("" Plimmer"") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 ("" Austotel "") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA."
Case21393,distinguished,Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company v Bovis Lend Lease Limited [2004] EWHC 2197 (Comm),"CGU argued that the judgment of Colman J in Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company v Bovis Lend Lease Limited [2004] EWHC 2197 (Comm) supported this submission. In that case a builder, Bovis, sued an owner, Braehead, for about [sterling]37 million being the monies allegedly outstanding under a building contract. Braehead counter-claimed for about [sterling]46 million for defective and non-compliant work and for about [sterling]49 million for mismanagement, together with [sterling]7 million claimed for liquidated damages. The total of the counter-claim amounted to about [sterling]103 million. The litigation was settled by an agreement under which Braehead agreed to pay Bovis [sterling]15 million. 16 Bovis held a professional liability policy with Lumbermens. It made a claim on the policy following the settlement. Lumbermens refused to indemnify and bought proceedings for a declaration that it had no liability to indemnify under the policy. Colman J upheld Lumbermens' argument. He said that under a liability policy the insurer was not obliged to indemnify unless the liability of the insured was ascertained, in the case of the settlement, by the settlement agreement. Until the liability of the insured was ascertained the insured had no cause of action for an indemnity. He said at [55]: ... a global settlement agreement of the nature of that found in the present case does not satisfy the requirement of ascertainment of loss under these liability insurance policies. It does not impose on the assured any identifiable loss in respect of any identifiable insured eventuality. It merely identifies the overall price paid by the assured as consideration for a contract which conferred on the assured various different benefits including the dropping by Braehead of all claims in respect of the project. 17 The facts of the instant case are distinguishable from those in Lumbermens . In Lumbermens it was not possible to determine from the settlement agreement whether any liability for mismanagement, the only liability which attracted indemnity, was part of the settlement sum. Colman J described the position at [7] thus: ... The method of calculation of that global sum was not identified in the agreement. In particular, there was no indication as to what extent if any Bovis's claim of [sterling]37,778,226 had been treated as validly in excess of [sterling]15 million or which if any of the many detailed elements of Braehead's counterclaim had been treated as valid. Indeed, the terms of the Settlement Agreement gave no indication as to whether the parties agreed that there was any substance in any of the elements of Braehead's counterclaim that is to say whether there was any common position that the claim by Bovis fell to be reduced because it was partly intrinsically defective or because part of Braehead's counterclaim could be set off against Bovis's claim. Nor does it contain any indication as to whether any particular amount was paid to settle such part of the counterclaims as the Insurers could not dispute fell within the scope of the indemnity. 18 In the present case the settlement agreement provided for CCAS to consent to orders that: (b) the Trustee pay the Applicants' costs of the Proceeding including reserved costs and costs of the amendments to the statement of claim, to be taxed on a party/party basis in default of agreement such costs to be paid forthwith. Thus, in this case, the agreement itself specified the liability incurred by the insured. The agreement thereby ascertained the liability of CCAS. Hence, the lack of ascertainment of the liability incurred by the insured which was the reason for Colman J upholding Lumbermens' argument, does not exist in this case. Rather, the present controversy concerns the discharge by the settlement agreement of the liability of CCAS which was not covered by the indemnity provided by CGU. That liability, although not its amount, was obvious from the terms of the settlement agreement. 19 In any event, the principle formulated in Lumbermens has been the subject of controversy. A little over a year after judgment in Lumbermens , Aikens J in Enterprise Oil Limited v Strand Insurance Company Ltd [2006] EWHC 58 (Comm) said at [166- 171]: Therefore, contrary to the view expressed by Colman J at paragraph 47 of his judgment in Lumbermen's , in my view those cases do not establish that it is a pre-condition for recovery under a liability policy that the insured has 'ascertained', by virtue of the wording of a judgment, or award or settlement agreement itself, the 'specific cost to the insured of discharging its insured liability'. In other words, in my view an insured does not have to show an amount of its loss to be claimed under an insured peril covered by the liability policy has been 'specifically ascertained' in the wording of a judgment, award or settlement. I say this for two particular reasons, quite apart from the fact that neither case uses such language. [original emphasis] The most important, if obvious, point is that an insurer always has the right to challenge whether the insured's right to indemnity under the policy has been established. Therefore it has the right to challenge whether the insured was, in fact and law, liable to the third party. It has the right to challenge the quantum of the liability. And it must also have the right to challenge whether, on the facts of the case, the insured's liability to the third party is a loss within the scope of the liability policy, whatever is stated in a judgment, award or settlement. Apart from anything else, the insurer will not be a party to the judgment, award or settlement, unless specifically involved. I accept that in the case of judgments and awards, the conclusion of a competent tribunal on the merits as to liability and quantum is unlikely to be upset in an action on the liability policy. But I cannot see why, in principle, it should not be challenged. In the case of settlements, Colman J himself specifically accepted that an insurer is not bound by a settlement agreement between the insured and the third party as to liability, or quantum. However, Colman J draws a distinction between two functions of 'ascertainment' by judgment, award or settlement. He describes one function as a 'source of evidence' as to liability and quantum of the insured to the third party. He says that cases affirming an insurer's right to challenge issues of liability and quantum in a settlement agreement are concerned only with that function of 'ascertainment'. But he states that the primary function of 'ascertainment' is to identify and 'thereby represent the assured's loss attributable to the relevant liability'. I cannot find that function identified in any of the cases to which Colman J refers. Moreover, it seems to me wrong in principle for the reason that I have already given, ie. that a judgment, award or settlement between an insured and a third party is not concerned to 'ascertain' the loss of the insured under a liability policy; it is irrelevant to those parties. I accept that if the insured has negotiated a settlement which identifies certain heads of claim as being referable to certain causes of action that are within the perils insured under the insured's liability policy, then that will be evidence that the insured has suffered a loss that is covered by the policy. But, as the case of MDIS Ltd v Swinbank shows, that can be challenged by underwriters. If it is challenged, then the question of whether there has been a loss covered by the policy terms will be decided on evidence that is extrinsic to the settlement agreement itself. If that exercise is permissible, which it must be, then I cannot see the basis for saying that an insured has no cause of action against a liability insurer unless it can demonstrate that there was a pre-existing determination, in the settlement agreement itself, of the precise amount of its liability to a third party that is attributable to a peril insured under the liability policy. Therefore, on principle, I think that it is open to an insured to assert and prove, by extrinsic evidence, that it is liable to a third party for a particular sum under a settlement that has been made and that the particular sum represents a loss covered by an insured peril under the liability policy. Equally, if an insured had made a settlement which purported to identify a particular sum as representing the quantum of liability for a particular type of loss that equated to an insured peril under the liability policy, the insurer would be free to challenge the insured's liability to the third party, the quantum of the liability and whether the particular liability identified in the settlement did, in fact, constitute a loss covered by an insured peril under the policy. These comments are obiter. Nevertheless they were adopted by Morrison J, also in obiter, in AIG Europe (Ireland) Limited v Faraday Capital Limited [2006] EWCH 2707 (Comm) at [69]. 20 In the event that I am wrong in my view that Lumbermens is distinguishable, I would find the criticism of that case by Aikens J compelling and prefer the approach adopted by him. I would apply it in this case. The result would be to permit CCAS to lead evidence of the separate costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS in order to establish that the settlement agreement included a liability which attracted the indemnity provided by CGU and was reasonable. 21 It follows from the above reasoning that CCAS has leave to reopen its case to establish that part of the settlement which represents the reasonable costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS, and, hence, the amount of the indemnity which CGU has contracted to provide. 22 Ms Dealehr has been a legal costs consultant for nearly 20 years. She has had extensive experience in the area. When the consent order was made on 18 November 2003 consequent upon the settlement of the applicants' claims, Ms Dealehr was engaged by the applicants' solicitors to prepare the bill of costs. She spent a month in the offices of the applicants' solicitors for the purpose and had access to their files. The bill which she produced was 353 pages long. It itemised each step in the litigation with detailed notation. The bill contained just over 2,300 separate items. They were recorded after consideration of the material in the files of the applicants' solicitors and this recording was done approximately at the time when Ms Dealehr considered that material."

Accordingly the matter is to be approached under subss (4) and (5). 30 It is common ground that the alleged delay in relation to the s 192 and s 39B parts of the case are to be dealt with on the same basis as the ADJR aspect, so that relief may be refused if application was not made within a reasonable time. 31 A chronology of the relevant events will assist in understanding the parties' contentions on delay. 14 January 2000 Extension of term granted 12 March 2002 Applicant incorporated May 2003 Applicant signed agreement with EBEWE Pharma Late May 2005, 2006- 2007 Dr Schnait of EBEWE Pharma tells Mr Gray that while Lilly had an Austrian patent for the product he could find no equivalent patent in Australia 2 August 2007 Applicant becomes aware of Australian patent and extension of term 12 October 2007 Applicant obtains patent file from IP Australia 26 October 2007 Applicant's TGA application 5 December 2007 Applicant writes to Lilly contending that extension of term was wrong and seeking confirmation of this 18 December 2007 Lilly sends letter of demand as to infringement 20 December 2007 Applicant seeks without prejudice meeting with Lilly to discuss commercial resolution 11 January to 27 February 2008 Communications about without prejudice meeting 28 February 2008 Without prejudice meeting 6 March 2008 Negotiations break down; Lilly sends second letter of demand 18 March 2008 Applicant informed of Austrian injunction 19 March 2008 Applicant seeks review of extension"
Case4309,discussed,Erduran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 814 ; (2002) 122 FCR 150,"Federal Magistrate pointed out that the Tribunal had not accurately reflected the observations of Branson J in Mijoljevic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 834 in that passage. Her Honour in that decision at [23] said that it is ordinarily the case that a basis for a claim of persecution within the meaning of the Convention will not flow from the enforcement of laws providing for compulsory military service, or for the punishment of those who avoid such service. The Federal Magistrate then referred to the decision of Gray J in Erduran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 814 , in particular at [28] where Gray J said: The question would have to be asked whether conscientious objectors, or some particular class of them, could constitute a particular social group. If it be the case that a person will be punished for refusing to undergo compulsory military service by reason of conscientious objection stemming from political opinion or religious views, or that is itself political opinion, or that marks the person out as a member of a particular social group of conscientious objectors, it will not be difficult to find that the person is liable to be persecuted for a Convention reason. It is well-established that, even if a law is a law of general application, its impact on a person who possesses a Convention-related attribute can result in a real chance of persecution for a Convention reason."
Case5771,applied,Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357,"In other words there was, as often happens in communications between two parties, a disconnect between the dominant purposes of each party for engaging in the communication. The question is whose purpose is relevant. In Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 , it was made clear (at [35]) that the relevant purpose is that of the person who procured the creation of the communication or document. In this case, the creation of both the communication (the Hodgson Interview) and the document (transcript) containing that communication was procured by the ACCC; that the ACCC had to offer and discuss immunity for Hodgson in order to get them was incidental to fulfilment of that dominant purpose. The correspondence and memoranda relied on by Cadbury, while illuminating the concerns of the interviewee Hodgson and the ACCC discussions of the means by which to meet those concerns and obtain the information sought, do not support a finding that the ACCC's dominant purpose was other than to investigate and prosecute suspected cartel conduct. 14 In my view, a review of all the documents identified by Cadbury confirms that the investigative purpose acknowledged by Cadbury (albeit incompletely) was in fact the dominant one. That is to say, as Cadbury accepted in its written submissions, the ACCC sought an interview of Hodgson to further its investigation; but that statement of purpose is not complete without answering the questions ""investigation of what"" and ""to what end."" 15 A letter from the ACCC to Hodgson's lawyers dated 13 December 2004 and attached to an affidavit of a solicitor for Cadbury answers the first question. It indicates that the ACCC at that time was investigating ""alleged cartel conduct engaged in by Amcor Limited and other corporations in relation to the supply of corrugated fibreboard containers."" A letter from the ACCC to Hodgson's lawyer dated 16 December 2004 and attached to an affidavit of a solicitor for the ACCC answers the second question. (Cadbury did not argue that Hodgson never received the 16 December letter, but objected to it on the basis that there was no evidence that it was sent on 16 December rather than provided to Hodgson at the interview on 17 December. However, I do not consider that anything turns on whether Hodgson received it on 16 December or instead 17 December.) The 16 December letter indicates that the ACCC sought information from Hodgson for the purpose of ""the investigation and any ensuing Court proceedings,"" including execution of affidavits and giving of evidence in Court proceedings. In other words, the letter shows that the dominant purpose of the interview was for the ACCC to obtain and assess evidence for Court proceedings then in contemplation."

It is not necessary to resort to any implied power in this case. The source of the Court's power to award costs against practitioners is to be found in s 43 and O 62 r 9. The latter rule authorises costs against practitioners as a specific application of the discretion to award costs conferred by the Act. The power is to be exercised with care and in clear cases only in which there has been conduct on the part of the solicitor which amounts to a serious dereliction of duty De Sousa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1993) 41 FCR 544 at 548. Unreasonable conduct in connection with the litigation may be sufficient to justify such an order. That criterion was described by Goldberg J in White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Flower &amp; Hart (a firm) (1998) 156 ALR 169 at 236 as: '... some deliberate or conscious decision taken by reference to circumstances unrelated to the prospects of success with either a recognition that there is no chance of success but an intention to use the proceeding for an ulterior purpose or with a disregard of any proper consideration of the prospects of success.' (emphasis added) 22 Having regard to the passages to which I have referred from the decision of the Full Court in Levick and the subsequent cases, I do not consider that the generality of the approach enunciated in De Sousa has been relevantly limited. A costs order may be made under s 43 of the Federal Court Act or O 62 r 9 when the solicitor or counsel has so failed in the duty to give proper consideration to the legal and/or factual questions involved in the preparation and presentation of an application as to be seriously derelict in his or her duty to the client and/or to the Court. There is no relevant distinction here between the position of solicitor and barrister whether in a divided or a fused profession."

The right of an object to take legal proceedings to prevent a disposal of income or capital by the trustee to persons outside the designated object does not involve the assertion of a proprietary right by the object and does not require the conclusion that the object has a proprietary interest in particular assets within the fund or is a 'beneficial owner' of such assets"".

Case4315,applied,Industry Research and Development Board v Bridgestone Australia Ltd [2004] FCAFC 56 ; (2004) 136 FCR 47,"regard to at least some of the evidence led before the Tribunal, supervisors of the applicant employed by the respondent and those associated with implementing his rehabilitation scheme possibly together with the members of Tribunal may have formed the view that the applicant was an extremely difficult person at best indifferent to the efforts of those trying to rehabilitate him and perhaps even unworthy of any sympathy. The Tribunal may also have found entirely unattractive the suggestion that the applicant's consumption of narcotic drugs to deal with the symptoms it thought were grossly exaggerated could be thought to justify, because it provided a reasonable excuse, his failure to comply with the rehabilitation program. However the SRC Act is beneficial legislation intended to operate for the benefit of injured employees whatever their personal attributes. If in fact the applicant's drug consumption prevented him from travelling to work then a finding to that effect would at least raise a question about whether there existed a reasonable excuse. In my opinion, the Tribunal was under a duty to consider the argument and reach and express a conclusion about it. It failed to address a case of substance advanced on behalf of the applicant and, in so doing, erred in law: Industry Research and Development Board v Bridgestone Australia Ltd [2004] FCAFC 56 ; (2004) 136 FCR 47 per Tamberlin, Sackville and Selway JJ at [26]. It is unnecessary to address the other grounds seeking to impugn the Tribunal's decision affirming, indirectly, the decision to suspend the applicant's rights to compensation. I deal briefly with the Tribunal's decision concerning compensation for cleaning services. The only ground challenging the Tribunal's affirming, indirectly, the respondent's decision that it was no longer liable to pay compensation for household cleaning services, was that the Tribunal did not give reasons for doing so. However, as best I can glean from the transcript, the challenge to that decision assumed no real prominence at the hearing before the Tribunal. Whether or not the applicant was entitled to compensation for household cleaning depended upon whether his work related injury limited his capacity to clean himself. As I have already explained, the Tribunal rejected, in fairly robust terms, the applicant's evidence about the disabling effect of his injury. Necessarily this involved a rejection of the contention that his injury prevented him from undertaking household cleaning. Little more was probably required by the Tribunal to indicate its rejection of the applicant's claim that the compensation for household cleaning services should have continued. I am not satisfied that the Tribunal erred, in this respect, as alleged. I propose to set aside the Tribunal's decision in relation to the suspension of rights to compensation and remit the matter but otherwise dismiss the appeal and application. As the applicant has had substantial success in its appeal, he is, in my opinion, entitled to his costs.

Case3409,considered,Commissioner of Taxation v Sleight [2004] FCAFC 94 ; (2004) 136 FCR 211,"Section 177D(b) requires the decision-maker to consider the eight matters referred to in the paragraph, and those matters alone, and to decide on the balance of probabilities if a certain conclusion would be drawn: Peabody v Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 40 FCR 531 (' Peabody ') at 541 per Hill J (Ryan and Cooper JJ concurring); Calder v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 61 ATR 267 (' Calder ') at 290 [91]. The conclusion to be drawn is, in this case, as to the relevant taxpayer's purpose and by reason of s 177A(5) that means his or her dominant purpose. A relevant taxpayer may have more than one purpose and one of his or her purposes may be to obtain commercial benefits. However, if, having regard to the matters in s 177D(b) , his or her dominant purpose is to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme, then Part IVA applies even if one of the relevant taxpayer's other purposes is to obtain commercial benefits: Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404 (' Spotless ') at 415-416; Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216 (' Hart ') at 227 [16] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J; Commissioner of Taxation v Sleight [2004] FCAFC 94 ; (2004) 136 FCR 211 (' Sleight ') at 229-230 [67] and 238-239 [113] per Hill J (with whom Hely J agreed); Calder at 291 [92]) . The question is to be determined objectively in the sense that the question is not as to the relevant taxpayer's subjective intention and purpose: Spotless at 421-422, 424; Hart at 233 [37], 243 [65] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; Peabody at 542; Calder at 291-292 [96]. What these propositions mean in this case is that the applicant's subjective purpose in entering into the scheme, even if a commercial one, is not of itself relevant. Furthermore, a decision-maker may conclude, after having regard to the matters in s 177D(b) , that the applicant had a commercial purpose in entering into the scheme but that will not assist him if it is otherwise concluded that his dominant purpose in entering into the scheme was to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme. 74 The authorities establish that in relation to the matters in s 177D(b) in any particular case one matter may be decisive and in another case it may only be after a careful weighing of all matters that a conclusion can be drawn. Furthermore, some factors may be neutral, others may point towards a commercial purpose but the conclusion drawn from a consideration of all matters may support a conclusion of a dominant purpose to obtain tax benefits in connection with the scheme ( Sleight at 229-230 [67]; Calder at 290 [91]). 75 In [58] above I have identified the Tribunal member's conclusion with respect to this matter and the fact that he said the six matters he identified did not 'diminish' the finding that the applicant's prevailing purpose was to obtain tax benefits in connection with the scheme. The applicant submits the Tribunal member should have found that the six matters negated a finding of a prevailing purpose of obtaining tax benefits, or at the least diminished it. 76 It is important to appreciate the reasoning of the Tribunal member. He identified features relevant to the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out. He decided, after considering those features, that a conclusion of a dominant purpose of obtaining tax benefits should be drawn. With respect, the Tribunal member's use of the word 'diminished' is not entirely felicitous, but I think, reading his reasons as a whole, it is clear what he meant. I do not think he was saying the six matters should not be considered or should not be weighed in the balance. In my opinion, all the Tribunal member was saying was that weighing them in the balance they did not dissuade him from reaching the conclusion that, in relation to the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out, the applicant's prevailing purpose was to obtain tax benefits in connection with the scheme. 90 The Tribunal member was entitled to have regard to the round-robin arrangements in concluding that the applicant's prevailing purpose was to obtain tax benefits. The weight he placed on the matter is unclear but ultimately that was a matter for him, and the applicant's case is not advanced by referring to another case where a Judge said that he was not inclined to place a great deal of weight on the round-robin arrangements Sleight at 232 [77] per Hill J). 91 The Tribunal member did not err in law in his approach to the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out, and the conclusions he reached in relation to that matter were reasonably open to him. 92 The Tribunal member said that the form of the scheme was one whereby the applicant conducted a business of growing wine grapes and using a limited recourse loan, whereas the substance of the scheme was a passive investment which, but for the tax benefits, would ordinarily have been cast in a different form. He said that that difference pointed to a prevailing purpose on the part of the applicant to obtain tax benefits. 95 The approach taken by the Tribunal member in relation to this matter was consistent with the approach taken in decisions of this Court. In Sleight , Hill J said (at 233 [81]- [82]): 'There is a difference between the form and the substance of the present scheme. In form there is an option whether to farm alone or to employ the management company. There is a management agreement and financing and interest payments. The form, involving prepayment of management fee and interest is, it may be concluded readily, designed to increase the taxation deductions available to an investor. The substance is, however, quite different. As senior counsel for the Commissioner put it, in substance the investor is a mere passive investor in what, once the tax features are removed, is a managed fund where no deduction would be available, or perhaps an alternative characterisation of the substance of the scheme is an investment in shares in the Land Company which at the expiration of 15 years is to own the tea tree plantation. With respect to the learned primary judge it is not correct to say that form and substance are the same. Rather the particular shape the investment took was clearly fashioned in a way that would maximise the tax deductions. They were geared up by the loan agreement with up front interest payments. But for the tax deductions the form the investment might be expected to take would clearly relate more to the substance of what happened. Rather than a loan with prepaid interest where the loan was to be repaid out of the investor's profit share without recourse (achieved through the indemnity agreement) the substance is that the investor was to receive only a lesser share of profit over the term of the loan agreement. The loan allowed, also, the prepayment of the management fee and the deduction which emanated from that.' 96 I refer also to the Full Court's decision in Calder (at 295-296 [116]-[118]). 97 I did not understand the applicant to challenge the Tribunal member's conclusions in relation to this matter. 102 The Tribunal member said that the matter must be considered as at the date the scheme was entered into and he referred to the reasons of Carr J in Sleight at 255-256 [223]-[224]. The applicant did not take issue with that approach. 103 The applicant's first submission in relation to the Tribunal member's reasons in relation to this matter was that he had made an error in concluding that, according to the projections, the applicant would begin to derive after tax returns in 2007, that is, after 10 years. The applicant submitted that this was wrong and that the projections indicated after tax-returns after six years. As I understand the projections, the applicant is right in the sense that after about six years there are after-tax returns before repayments of the loan are taken into account. If repayments of the loan are taken into account there are only after-tax returns after 10 years. 104 I have no doubt that the Tribunal member did not misunderstand the effect of the projections. Earlier in his reasons he summarised the position accurately as follows: 'Moreover, until 2007, tax savings were, in substance, the only source of returns to the participant as follows: (a) From 1997-2001, the participant's returns were the result of tax savings which more than covered the cash payments required of him pursuant to the loan; (b) From 2003-2006, the project was expected to generate revenue of its own. However, in those years, the structure of the loan resulted in neutral cashflows to the participant who, after meeting his loan obligations was to be paid enough only to meet anticipated tax obligations. (c) Only in the latter years of the project, 2007-2012, when the loan was paid off, was the project expected to be cashflow positive to the participant by reason of revenue received from the proceeds of the project itself.'"
Case9364,followed,Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 144,"ACI submitted that if the Court held that it had the power to make an order for compensation which took into account non-economic loss it should be guided by the principles for the award of non-pecuniary loss which have been developed in unfair dismissal jurisprudence. It referred to the judgment of the Full Court of Industrial Relations Court of Australia in Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 144 at 156 where the Court said: ""There is an element of distress in every termination. To ensure compensation is confined within reasonable limits, restraint is required. But in this case there were unusual exacerbating circumstances that make it appropriate to include in the compensation an allowance for the distress unnecessarily caused to Ms Burazin. These circumstances include Ms Burazin having to suffer the humiliating experience of being escorted from Blacktown's premises by the police. Having regard to these circumstances, the compensation assessed by the trial judge should be increased by the sum of $2000, to $5,000."" 6 ACI observed that the only evidence of non-economic loss before the Court was that contained in Mr Williams' affidavit of 14 October 2005 which referred to the financial stress occasioned by his termination. It said that there was no evidence about any ""unusual exacerbating circumstances"" associated with the manner of his termination. 7 The Union submitted that the passage in Burazin relied upon by ACI did not articulate a ""benchmark test"" but only stated why, on the facts before the Court, compensation for distress was appropriate. The Union contended that there is no warrant for limiting compensation for non-economic loss to situations which are ""unusual and exacerbating."" 8 The Union said that Mr Williams suffered an injury in two ways. First, it said that he was not permitted to leave his work premises in a dignified way but was pressed to leave the factory quickly with security summoned. Second, it said that Mr Williams' sudden unemployment caused him stress and tension as a result of his family losing the income of its sole breadwinner. 9 The Union conceded that Mr Williams gave no evidence about the impact of ACI's treatment on him on the day of his termination. It further accepts that some restraint is called for but contends that, in the circumstances, some compensatory order should be made. It also submitted that some compensation should be given to Mr Williams as a result of his affidavit evidence that his termination caused him shock and emotional strain and placed his relationship with his wife under pressure. 11 I make no order as to compensation in the circumstances of this case. To do otherwise would not be acting with restraint. In my view Burazin establishes that something more is required for compensation for non-economic loss than the usual element of distress which accompanies most terminations. Whilst ""unusual and exacerbating circumstances"" is not necessarily the yardstick, there must be something attending a termination which justifies an order for non-economic loss. Such an order may have been made in this case had Mr Williams given evidence of the effect on him of his ejection from his workplace by security personnel. Order There be no order as to compensation.

Case2725,cited,WAEJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 188,"preceding those observations, the Tribunal contextualised its conclusions concerning the weight and utility of the witness statements by making this observation: In SZANI v MIMIA [2004] S[F]CA 1298 Tamberlin J referred to the decision of WAEJ v MIMIA [2003] FCAFC 188 where the Full Court at page [para] 52 said: ""On its face the foregoing was a statement by the RRT that the document was not authentic. This was not a case where dishonesty on the part of the appellant had been demonstrated thereby providing support for the further conclusion that the appellant had arranged for the preparation, and tender of, a non authentic, or forged, document which the RRT could disregard. There was no finding by the RRT that the evidence of the appellant was so discredited that any purportedly corroborative material presented on his behalf could be discarded without further analysis (emphasis added by the Full Federal Court)."" [There is no emphasis in the quoted passage] The sequence of reasoning adopted by the Tribunal seems to have been reflected in four steps. Firstly, the Tribunal has ""duly considered"" the information from the appellant's witnesses relating to the appellant's engagement with Maoist groups or her husband's engagement with such groups and has duly considered information from these witnesses relating to the ""consequences of such connections"". Secondly, the nature and degree of the credibility problems the Tribunal has with the evidence of the appellant is such that the witness statements cannot be redemptive of the poisoned well of credibility, that is, the Tribunal cannot give the statements such weight ""as can help resolve the appellant's credibility problems in relation to her claims about abuse in Nepal"". Thirdly, guidance in the approach to the utility of corroborative statements can be found in the decision of Tamberlin J in SZANI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1298 and the reference in that decision to the reasons of the Full Court in WAEJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 188 , which suggest to the Tribunal that where there is a finding by the Tribunal that the evidence of the appellant is fundamentally ""discredited"", any purportedly corroborative material presented in support of a discredited version of events, may be discarded."
Case5525,cited,Hocking v Bell (1947) 75 CLR 125,"this application, there are no contested questions of fact which might be resolved one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed in the sense contemplated in Hocking v Bell (1947) 75 CLR 125 , which influenced the approach to s 31A by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352. Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 246 ALR 465 took the view that the test of reasonable prospect of success was a less stringent test than that proposed by Rares J in Boston Commercial . Plainly, the Court must be cautious not to do Mrs Vranic an injustice by summarily dismissing or foreclosing the proceeding. However, the question is whether as a matter of substance rather than form ( White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 per Lindgren J) Mrs Vranic's construction has no reasonable prospect of success."

Case9230,referred to,Russell v Scott [1936] HCA 34 ; (1936) 55 CLR 440,"The presumption of a resulting trust that arises when property is transferred without consideration into the name of a person who is neither the child, adopted child or wife of the transferor, does no more than call for proof of an intention to confer beneficial ownership. Prima facie there is a resulting trust but where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership, the presumption is rebutted (see Russell v Scott ('Russell v Scott') [1936] HCA 34 ; (1936) 55 CLR 440 the case of an aunt who put money into a joint bank account in her name and that of her nephew on the basis that it would be held in trust for the aunt during her lifetime but thereafter the beneficial interest would pass to the nephew). 131 Given Mr Ku's evidence that he prepared the 'Change to company details' form, a copy of which is reproduced in Schedule 1, before his meeting with Luke Song on 25 October, that it bears the date 23 October and was handed by Mr Ku to Mr Kim on 24 October with the request that Mr Kim forward it to ASIC in the express post envelope which Mr Ku provided, I have great difficulty in accepting that, when he was speaking with Luke Song on 25 October 2006, he said: 'I will transfer all my shares of Kjun International Pty Ltd to your son first as good gesture if you sign this agreement.' It is unlikely that he would have used the words mentioned and in particular the word 'if' in circumstances where the 'Change to company details' form had already been prepared, signed and handed to his solicitor Mr Kim for transmission to ASIC in Melbourne. I would place greater emphasis upon the words 'Everyone will say I am the most stupid person doing this but I value more our trust than who is got what and who has the right'. Equally, I have difficulty in accepting that the conversation included the words 'If anything goes wrong I didn't get a single dollar so I can get the shares back'. This is not a case where a resulting trust should be implied if it be found that the shares were duly transferred by Mr Ku to Ji Song. As was said in Russell v Scott there will be no resulting trust where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership. In my opinion such a transfer was intended in respect of the shares but not perfected, there being no duly executed share transfer form which was delivered to Ji Song or another person on his behalf. 132 Mr Ku says that, at the meeting on 25 October, he and Luke Song addressed the longer form of agreement which he had prepared on 24 October 2006. He said in relation to the consideration of the longer form of agreement: 'We ran through all the clauses in the agreement one by one.' 133 Luke Song deposed to the production by Mr Ku of a document with clauses 'A' to 'G' on it. This is hardly illuminating. There was no form of agreement which included clauses A, B, C, D, E, F and G. There were, however, two different forms of agreement which began with 'A' and ended with 'G'. The longer form of agreement included clauses A, B, C, D, D (a second D), F and G. The shorter form of agreement contained clauses A, B, D, F and G."
Case10510,cited,Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341,"Notwithstanding the circumstances in which the orders were made, on 14 July 2008 the unusual course of permitting cross-examination was again raised with Counsel for the Applicants and, more relevantly, Counsel for Mr Kiriakidis. Reference was made to the observations of Menzies J in Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341. Counsel for Mr Kiriakidis requested, and was granted, a short adjournment to obtain further instructions in light of reference being made to the unusual course being pursued. The cross-examination thereafter continued without any submissions being advanced on his behalf. As events unfolded, it was probably the only effective means whereby the Applicants could have exposed what they believed were inadequacies in the existing discovery as provided particularly by the Fourth Respondent. As a result of the cross-examination, the Applicants were proved right. An order requiring a further affidavit to be filed in respect to particular documents, without knowledge of the manifest deficiencies in the existing discovery, may well have proved as ineffective as the discovery previously provided. 51 At least two observations need to be made. 52 First, some evidence given during cross-examination was that documents had been destroyed. As explained by Mr Kiriakidis, the destruction of documents occurred by reason of either: &#8226; such records as had been kept by Mr Kiriakidis being stored in boxes in a room behind a caf&eacute; where he was then residing, and being thrown out when he was in Greece for a period of six months from July 2006 to January 2007. The owner of the premises was said to have thrown out the boxes when Mr Kiriakidis did not return after what was expected to be only a three month visit; and &#8226; such other records as may have been maintained being routinely destroyed by employees, upon instructions, at the conclusion of every two week period. Mr Kiriakidis explained his concern as to whether or not the business was illegal and that he did not want records being maintained in such circumstances. Whether or not there was a basis for those concerns was not an issue pursued by Counsel for the Fourth Respondent during his cross-examination. It is a matter, however, which it is expected will emerge as an issue to be resolved at the final hearing."

An error of fact which may have been made by the Minister is not reviewable by this Court unless it relates to a jurisdictional fact or is a manifestation of some error of law, substantive or procedural, which constitutes jurisdictional error and thereby vitiates the purported decision: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 351-352 per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; NABE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 at [53] ."
Case13508,cited,Chapman v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2000) 77 SASR 181,"As I have said, paragraph 46 identifies the imputations which are said to arise in both the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, and by way of a true innuendo. It is necessary to give particulars of the facts and circumstances which are said to support a claim of libel which relies upon the true innuendo. The applicants have given particulars of those facts and circumstances, and there is no complaint about those particulars. There was no obligation at common law to plead particular imputations where the cause of action relies upon the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. However, in New South Wales there was an obligation to plead such imputations under the Defamation Act (1974) (NSW): s 9(2). More recently, it has become the practice in this State and other States in Australia to plead the imputations which are said to arise out of publication, even if those imputations are said to arise in the natural and ordinary meaning of the words: Chapman v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2000) 77 SASR 181. 49 In response to the respondent's request, the applicants provided a schedule which identified the particular documents in each of the paragraphs either for the plea that the imputation arises in the natural and ordinary meaning of the words or for the plea that the imputation arises by way of innuendo."
Case11258,considered,Puhlhofer v Hillingdon London Borough Council [1986] UKHL 1 ; [1986] AC 484,"Further, Smith FM said, at [44]: The applicant's counsel in his written and oral submissions made unfocused complaints about the Tribunal's decision which were clearly outside the ambit of his amended application. These were, in my opinion, almost entirely attacks on the merits of the factual assessments reached by the Tribunal. However, the Tribunal was required to address impressionistic criteria which were particularly difficult to apply to the present case. In this situation a court of judicial review must bear in mind its duty ""to leave the decision of that fact to the public body to whom Parliament has entrusted the decision-making power save in a case where it is obvious that the public body, consciously or unconsciously, are acting perversely"" ( Puhlhofer v Hillingdon London Borough Council [1986] UKHL 1 ; [1986] AC 484 at 518, quoted in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Eschetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [41] ). Counsel's arguments did not cause me to arrive at such a judgment in this case. 36 The draft Notice of Appeal contains a ground: 3. The Federal Magistrate erred by accepting MRT's ""impressionistic criteria"", which revealed a misconception of the law and therefore consciously or unconsciously acted perversely. 37 Whether the factual integers in Regulation 1.15A can fairly and properly be described as ""impressionist criteria"" is open to argument. It is arguable that the proposition, stated by the Federal Magistrate that a court of judicial review can only interfere in the facts of this case if it was obvious that the Tribunal or the delegate consciously or unconsciously was acting perversely , relying on the observation of Lord Brightman in Puhlhofer v Hillingdon London Borough Council [1986] UKHL 1 ; [1986] AC 484 at 518, is an overstatement of what Lord Brightman said. 38 The full quote indicates that the nature of the duty of a Court to respect the fact-making function to the person to whom Parliament has entrusted the decision making power of which his Lordship was speaking, is to be understood in the context of the variable circumstances of fact finding described by the opening words: Where the existence or non-existence of a fact is left to the judgment and discretion of a public body and that fact involves a broad spectrum ranging from the obvious to the debatable to the just conceivable ... 39 In this case, the first respondent says that ""the proposed notice of appeal has no merit nor is there any jurisdictional error apparent in the Tribunal's reasons for decision or legal error apparent in the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate."" 40 The first respondent acknowledges that the delay in filing the Notice of Appeal was occasioned by the applicant's counsel's absence from Australia and that the delay is short, and no prejudice has been occasioned by that delay. 41 The respondent submits: The sole basis for the respondent's opposition to the application is that, in the respondent's submission, the proposed appeal does not have sufficient prospects to justify the Court's discretion being exercised in the applicant's favour."
Case15168,applied,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 794 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220,"Once the Tribunal's actual findings are set out in this way, it is plain enough that grounds 4 and 5 fail. The Tribunal plainly rejected the appellant's claim to be homosexual. At the same time, it allowed for the possibility that a homosexual demeanour might be attributed to him in Australia on account of his involvement in the CAAH and his association with homosexuals in Australia. It held, however, that it was unlikely that his involvement in CAAH or his association with homosexuals in Australia would result in a homosexual demeanour being attributed to him in Bangladesh. It also held that it was unlikely that he would continue activities of this kind on returning to Bangladesh (since they were done in Australia to enhance his refugee claim). Notwithstanding this, however, in accordance with Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 794 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 ("" Rajalingam "") at 62-63, the Tribunal went on to consider the appellant's situation in what it saw as the unlikely event that this attribution or imputation was made in Bangladesh. In this regard, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant would ""be subject to serious harm amounting to persecution"". 28 If the passage set out at [17] above is understood in this way, it is apparent that no error of the kind for which the appellant contends has occurred. That is, in the Tribunal's reasons, the passage can be read as intended to support the proposition that there is no real chance of serious harm befalling a person in Bangladesh on account of overt (and a fortiori covert) homosexual behaviour. 29 Another passage towards the conclusion of the Tribunal's reasons, on which the appellant relied, must also be read in the light of the findings and in the entirety of the Tribunal's reasons. In this passage, the Tribunal referred first to the provision of country information by the appellant's adviser and to her submission about a lack of state protection. It then commented: While accepting that Bangladesh is at the moment experiencing severe political disruption and turmoil, and there is some politically orientated violence, the Tribunal has not been able to find any evidence that homosexual males, and even more importantly than [sic] those people like the Applicant who may have a gay demeanour or association imputed to them, are being subject to a particular persecution or are being targeted at this time because of it or that there has been a breakdown in effective state protection for this particular social group. Accordingly, in view of all the above and its earlier findings, the Tribunal does not accept this claim and is satisfied that there is not a real chance that the Applicant would be subject to serious harm amounting to persecution for a Convention reason (including his particular social group, actual or imputed) because of the current political difficulties in Bangladesh. 30 The appellant argued that the expression ""like the Applicant"" indicated that the Tribunal made a positive finding concerning the imputation of a homosexual demeanour to the appellant in Bangladesh. When this passage is read in the context of the Tribunal's entire reasons, as indeed the Tribunal expressly invited the reader to do, it is clear that this is not so. In this passage, the Tribunal was doing no more than responding to the appellant's adviser's submission concerning effective state protection upon the basis required by Rajalingam. That is, it was considering the appellant's position in what it saw as the unlikely event that an imputation of homosexuality was made in Bangladesh. In this regard, the Tribunal was not satisfied that there was a real chance that the appellant would be subjected to serious harm amounting to persecution for a Convention reason. 31 When the Tribunal's actual findings are stated, it is apparent that the Tribunal gave consideration to the appellant's claims to fear persecution because of ""his ... imputed membership of a Particular Social Group being gay men in Bangladesh"" (compare ground 4), although it considered the imputation in Bangladesh to be unlikely. In this latter regard, ground 4 misstates the Tribunal's finding. The Tribunal gave this question consideration in accordance with its obligation as outlined in Rajalingam . Ground 4 is therefore not sustainable. Similarly and on the same basis, the Tribunal gave attention to the question ""whether gay men (imputed or actual) as a Particular Social Group were the subject of persecution in Bangladesh for the purposes of the Convention as modified by the Act "". Ground 5 also fails. Examination of the Tribunal's reasons and the appellant's submissions shows that the appellant's real argument is with the merits of the Tribunal's decision. This is not, however, a matter that properly falls for consideration in the Federal Magistrates Court on judicial review or in this Court on appeal."
Case23807,cited,Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193,"On 23 February 2007 I delivered reasons substantially upholding Mr Guest's contentions in this matter. I directed that counsel bring in minutes of proposed orders to give effect to the reasons: Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193. 2 Differences have arisen between the parties as to the appropriate calculation of interest for which I have held Mr Guest is entitled to deductions. Written submissions have been filed. 3 Two issues arise: the method of calculation of interest and the application of sale of fruit proceeds. Depending on which approach is correct as to each issue, Mr Guest may have been under no liability at all to Rural Finance as at 31 March 1991 in which case no deductions will be allowable for the tax years in question (1998 2001 inclusive). Alternatively, there may be a liability which will result in a deduction for substantially less than the amounts claimed."
Case4311,referred to,Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 456 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280,"have identified the focus of submissions on the appeal in that way because, notwithstanding the general observations of the Tribunal set out in [6] above which may demonstrate legal error, they do not do so relevantly except in the context of a claim by the appellant to be a conscientious objector. I would otherwise read the Tribunal's observations in that passage, with an eye not keenly attuned to the perception of error (see Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 456 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280) , as indicating no more than that the enforcement of laws for compulsory military service do not of themselves provide a basis for a claim of persecution merely because those obliged to undertake compulsory military service might thereby be at greater risk than civilians. If the appellant were not in fact a conscientious objector, there was nothing to indicate that she was required to undertake compulsory military service for a Convention reason or that she would then be treated differently whilst doing so for a Convention reason. Indeed, counsel for the appellant appeared to accept as much. At one point, he said that the error discussed by the Federal Magistrate flowed from failing to ask what would happen to the appellant if she is a conscientious objector."

Case720,referred to,Unilever Australia Limited v Karounos [2001] FCA 1132 ; (2001) 52 IPR 361,"First, it is contrary to established authority on the construction and operation of s 88(2)(a). In Unilever Australia Limited v Karounos [2001] FCA 1132 ; (2001) 52 IPR 361 at [13] , Hill J said that under this sub-section: The court is required to consider the question as at the time of registration and determine whether as at that time it was proper for the registrar to admit the mark to the register. Facts subsequent to the date of registration will be irrelevant. 109 Other authorities to the same effect are referred to in Davison M, Johnston K, Kennedy P , Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off , (3 rd ed , Thomson Lawbook Co, 2003) at [14.175] n 127."
Case1678,cited,Lawrance v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2005] FCA 541,"The second category arises out of the application heard by Senior Member Kelly on 1 November 2004. The applicant seeks an order prohibiting the learned member from making her decision and orders removing her from the conduct of the review. However, I refused to grant interlocutory relief which sought to prevent Senior Member Kelly from making her decision; see [2005] FCA 79. Leave to appeal from my judgment was refused by Hely J; see [2005] FCA 541. The request for such orders in the present proceedings has thus been overtaken by the publication of Senior Member Kelly's decision on 24 May 2005. 167 Moreover, as Hely J observed in Lawrance v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2005] FCA 541 at [39] there is an additional problem with the applicant's claim. A witness appearing before the AAT has the protection conferred by s 60(3) of the AAT Act . As his Honour said, the applicant's claim for an injunction would run counter to the immunity given by that section even if it were established that Ms Smith lied at the hearing before Senior Member Kelly. 168 In any event, Senior Member Kelly accepted the evidence of Ms Smith. That was a finding of fact made within jurisdiction. 169 The applicant asks me to make an order under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the Court suppress her name and refrain from publishing its decision in this matter."
Case15893,referred to,Corrs Pavey Whiting and Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434,"As far as the confidentiality agreement is concerned, Mr Atta made the following submissions: 1. The confidentiality agreement is void for uncertainty because it contains only an inclusive and not an exclusive definition of confidential information. Reading down or severance is not possible. 2. The confidentiality agreement is a restraint on competition and void as against public policy because it purports to go beyond what may be lawfully protected. Mr Atta referred to the decision in Wright v Gasweld Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 317. Again, it is said that reading down or severance is not possible. 3. As I understood it, the submission was that even in the case of a confidentiality agreement which purports to define confidential information a party complaining of a breach of such an agreement must prove the information disclosed was in fact confidential. Reference was made to the requirements in equity for the protection of confidential information: Corrs Pavey Whiting and Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 at 443 per Gummow J. There is no evidence that the information was confidential and Mr Atta said that it was not confidential. 4. The information disclosed [to THQ and Cygnett] was disclosed after Mr Atta had left the company's employ. 5. There is no pleading of loss which could conceivably flow from a breach of the confidentiality agreement. There is a claim for damages for breach of the confidentiality agreement, but the only claim for loss and damage particularised in the statement of claim relates (so it is said) to the alleged breach of the implied term. 170 I do not think the submission in paragraph 3 is right. In the case referred to Gummow J identified the elements of an equitable action for breach of confidence. His Honour was not dealing with a claim for breach of contract by disclosing confidential information as defined in the agreement. There is nothing to suggest that subject to restraint of trade considerations the parties cannot define for themselves what is confidential. They are not bound to protect no more than is already protected in equity. 171 The submission in paragraph 4 cannot succeed because the confidentiality agreement specifically purports to apply to the period after Mr Atta has left the employ of Futuretronics. 172 The submission in paragraph 5 is essentially a pleading point which I would not allow Mr Atta to raise at this late stage or at least without giving Futuretronics the opportunity to apply to further amend."
Case13147,referred to,Richardson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1932] HCA 67 ; (1932) 48 CLR 192,"fact that a tax liability remains outstanding against two taxpayers pending the ascertainment of the taxpayer truly liable is no bar to the exercise of the power to assess both to tax in respect of the same income. As Dixon J, as his Honour then was, observed in Richardson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1932] HCA 67 ; (1932) 48 CLR 192 at 207 when upholding the validity of an assessment to tax against a second person while the first person's assessment remained on foot and unamended 'it was not unnatural that [the Commissioner] should delay relieving one of two persons whom he considered culpable until the liability of the other was established'. The co-existence of tax liabilities in two or more taxpayers in respect of the same income is, as Dixon J observed at 207, attended with difficulty. Sometimes the difficulty will be removed by the objection, review and appeal procedures where the taxpayer will establish the facts in order to establish that the assessment is excessive (per Brennan J in Richard Walter at 201)."
Case12937,cited,Re Hansen; Ex parte Hansen (1985) 4 FCR 590,"present relevance is whether a mistake in the name of the creditor vitiates a bankruptcy. In Re Hansen; Ex parte Hansen (1985) 4 FCR 590 Beaumont J concluded that there was a formal defect in a bankruptcy notice issued in the name of "" Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation of Australia Limited "". That company had, however, changed its name to "" MGICA Limited "". His Honour at 592 concluded: Strict compliance with the requisites of a bankruptcy notice is essential to its validity and if the notice is capable of misleading the debtor in a material respect, the court will not inquire whether the debtor has in fact been misled: it is sufficient that he could be misled ... He concluded at 594 as follows: In my opinion, it is essential to the validity of a bankruptcy notice that the judgment debtor be in no reasonable doubt as to the identity of the judgment creditor. In the present case, the judgment creditor was identified by a name which it had abandoned some considerable time previously. That name was quite different from the name of the judgment creditor at the time of issue of the bankruptcy notice and the judgment debtor could hardly be expected to connect the two corporate names. The judgment debtor could thus have been misled as to the identity of the party with whom he had to deal in order to comply with the requirements of the bankruptcy notice. The notice was accordingly defective ... Similarly, in McWilliam v Jackson [2000] FCA 175 , 96 FCR 561 Wilcox J concluded that a bankruptcy notice that identified the creditor as ""Anthony Jackson &amp; Ors"" rather than ""Anthony Jackson"" was defective."
Case10471,cited,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592,"The Minister submits that this issue was fully canvassed before the RRT.

Case5963,referred to,Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 ,"determination of the dominant purpose is a question of fact that must be determined objectively. It is not the same as the 'primary' or the 'substantial' purpose ( Grant v Downs at 678). The dominant purpose may be best described as the ruling, prevailing, paramount or most influential purpose ( Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victoria WorkCover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332 at 336 337). Where the claim is in respect of communications in documents, the court may examine the documents to ascertain the purpose for their creation (Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at 70). An appropriate starting point is to ask what was the intended use or uses of the document which accounted for it being brought into existence ( Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 (' Pratt ') at [35] per Finn J, confirmed in AWB v Cole (No. 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 at [44] ). If a court finds on the balance of probabilities that the entirety of the document was created for the requisite purpose, then the entire document attracts the privilege. If a court finds that parts, but not all of the document, were created for this purpose, then those parts will attract the privilege (see GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology [2000] FCA 593 at [11] ; Grofam Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 408 at 414 417)."
Case18178,referred to,BT Australasia Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 8) (1998) 154 ALR 202,"For the purposes of subsection (2), the applicant must establish that the client ""knowingly and voluntarily disclosed to another person the substance of the evidence and the disclosure was not made [in one of the four specified circumstances]"". None of the specified circumstances obtain. Moreover, it is clear that there was disclosure ""to another person"" (the applicant himself) of the entirety of the evidence, such that no question as to what amounts to ""the substance of the evidence"" arises. The point turned upon whether the disclosure was made ""knowingly and voluntarily"". The relationship between mistaken or inadvertent disclosure and voluntary disclosure cannot be expressed definitively. It has been held that disclosure by mistake is not, for that reason alone, involuntary, at least where the disclosure is made in the course of formal discovery: Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 145 ALR 391 at 406 per Goldberg J. The relevant disclosure in the present case occurred when written submissions were served upon the applicant by the respondents. In fact, in the formal discovery process, that is, when the respondents' list of documents was filed, privilege was claimed over those parts of the memorandum dealing with the legal advice from the AGS. Even if some mistaken disclosures can nonetheless be made knowingly and voluntarily within the meaning of subsection (2), I was not satisfied that there was such a disclosure in this case. This is a case ""where everything indicates an intention to claim privilege in respect of the document and what has gone wrong is attributable to sheer inadvertence or carelessness"": Sovereign at [23] per Austin J; see also BT Australasia Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 8) (1998) 154 ALR 202 at 208-209 per Sackville J. In Sovereign , Austin J placed weight upon the fact that the solicitor in receipt of the privileged letter mistakenly disclosed must have realised that it was privileged. That is equally true in the present case in light of the respondents' solicitors' letter to the applicant of 7 February 2007 which asserted the privilege. Moreover, the written submissions (to which the unedited copy of the memorandum was attached) referred to the memorandum as ""document 49 in the List of Documents"", in respect of which privilege was claimed, and claimed to the knowledge of the applicant. This fact militates against the view that the respondents intended to change their position in respect of the privilege and that it was voluntarily waived when the written submissions were served."
Case20191,cited,Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Ltd [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538,"Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Ltd [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 at 568: 'If a statement is directed from one place to another place where it is known or even anticipated that it will be received by the [applicant] , there is no difficulty in saying that the statement was, in substance, made at the place to which it was directed, whether or not it is there acted upon. ...'"
Case19491,cited,Chatterton v Cave (1878) 3 App Cas 483,"In the context of these observations, the following remarks of Lindgren J in Eagle Homes v Austec Homes (supra) concerning the role a finding of conscious copying plays in aiding the determination of the question of reproduction apply in the present case. The observations are these: '[91] ...In no case concerning project homes of which I am aware, where there has been such a finding of actual copying, has it been held that nonetheless the copier will not have infringed copyright unless there is in addition an extraordinarily close resemblance between his or her drawing and the copyright work. Rather, I think that the issue of sufficient objective similarity simply poses in the case of project homes, as in other cases, the usual question whether the copyright drawing can still be seen embedded in the allegedly infringing drawing, that is, whether the allegedly infringing drawing has adopted the ""essential features and substance"" of the copyright work Hanfstaengl v HR Baines &amp; Co Ltd [1895] AC 20 at 31 [Lord Shand]. [92] ... I do not accept, however, that where, as here, actual copying is found to have occurred, ""reproduction"", and therefore infringement, cannot be proved in the absence of such a specially close similarity as might be required in a particular case to support an inference of subjective copying. To insist that a copyright owner can satisfy the ""sufficient objective similarity"" limb of reproduction only by establishing such a close similarity is a hurdle too high to be placed before a copyright owner who is found to have proved subjective copying. The way of the copier, including the copier of a plan of a project home, should not be made easy. A copier intends to benefit from another's skill and labour. It may transpire that what the copier produces is, at the end of the day and as a result of whatever intervening causes, so dissimilar from the copyright drawing that the copyright drawing cannot be seen in the allegedly infringing drawing. But in my view that is not this case. ... [94] A similar observation was made by Starke J in Blackie &amp; Sons Ltd v Lothian Book Publishing Co Pty Ltd [1921] HCA 27 ; (1921) 29 CLR 396. His Honour, sitting at first instance, found actual copying and said (at 404): ""It is not for the court to make the way of the taker of copyright matter easy. It is a sound principle of copyright law that the court should not allow one man to take away the result 'of another man's labour, or, in other words, his property', unless it is satisfied that the part taken is 'so slight, and the effect upon the total composition was so small', 'as to render the taking perfectly immaterial', or, what is much the same thing, that the part taken is an unsubstantial part: Hogg v Scott (1874) LR 18 Eq 444 at 458; Chatterton v Cave (1878) 3 App Cas 483 at 490, 495. ... [98] The two elements of ""causal link"" and ""sufficient objective similarity"" are not referred to in the Act and are but aspects of ""reproduction"". The two are interrelated and it can be artificial to consider them separately, at least in a case like the present one where actual copying is found to have occurred. A finding of copying can add significance to objective similarity; cf Anchor, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278 at 289; S W Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems [1985] HCA 59 ; (1985) 159 CLR 466 at 474; 61 ALR 251 (Wilson J). [99] It is often suggested that, once a copyright owner has established subjective copying, that makes easier the task of proving that what was taken was ""a substantial part"" of a protective work. For example, in Anchor, Mortlock, Street J said (at 289) ""I have already ... inferred that the defendant did engage in unfair copying of the plaintiff's plans and houses. This adds significance to the similarities that do exist and diminishes significance from the dissimilarities"". See also Bradbury v Hotten (1872) 8 LR Ex 1 and Chappell &amp; Co Ltd v D C Thompson &amp; Co Ltd [1928-35] MacG Cop Cas 476 (Ch D).'"
Case2900,considered,Western Australia v Strickland [2000] FCA 652 ; (2000) 99 FCR 33,"The occasion for affording the word ""likely"" the meaning ""more probable than not"" in a provision directed to the dismissal of a native title application without a hearing on the merits of that application is less compelling. It is true that the occasion for the exercise of the dismissal power in s 190F(6) of the Native Title Act may arise after the Registrar's registration decision has either been administratively reviewed on the merits by the NNTT or reviewed by this Court. In the latter form of review the Court may make such decision in respect of issues of fact and law on the material then available as will do justice: Western Australia v Strickland [2000] FCA 652 ; (2000) 99 FCR 33 (Full Court). Yet the focus of these review alternatives remains the Registrar's registration decision, not a determination of the merits of the native title claim made in the application. 46 Regard pursuant to s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) to secondary materials concerning the Bill which became the Technical Amendments Act offers no assistance either in the preferable meaning to afford the word ""likely"" in s 190F(6)(a) or, for that matter, in the ascertainment of the purpose of the power conferred on the Court by the sub-section. 47 The reference in the explanatory memorandum to the clause which became s 190F(6) is nothing more than a paraphrase of the provision. The Ministerial Second Reading Speech (Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 29 March 2007, p. 1) in respect of the Bill which became the Technical Amendments Act is brief, the then Attorney remarking generally of the amendments proposed in that Bill, ""While these amendments are minor and technical in nature, they will substantially improve the workability of the Native Title Act ."" There is no reference to the proposed empowerment of the Court to dismiss an application as a sequel to a decision by the Register not to accept for registration the claim made in it and after exhaustion of review remedies in respect of that decision. 48 Amendments to that Bill were proposed in the Senate following a report by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of that House. Both in that committee's report and in Parliamentary debates one finds reference to the report of a review commissioned by the then Attorney-General of native title claims resolution processes by two members of the Queensland Bar, Mr Hiley RFD, QC and Dr Levy RFD (Hiley and Levy, Native Title Claims Resolution Review, Commonwealth of Australia, released on 31 March 2006). The report of that review was made public but it was not tabled in the Parliament. Further, the extent of its influence on the presence in the Native Title Act of what is now s 190F(6) is not made clear either in an explanatory memorandum or the Second Reading Speech. In these circumstances, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to refer to that review report for statutory construction purposes. 49 A study of secondary materials confirms what a perusal of the 2007 Amendment Act and the Technical Amendments Act would in any event suggest, which is that the two Acts were the culmination of an endeavour to address inadequacies perceived by the Parliament in native title law and practice under the Native Title Act even after major amendments were made to that Act by the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth) (1998 Amendment Act)."
Case17272,cited,Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187,"Minister's notice of appeal should have been filed and served by 27 March 2009. It was filed and served six days late. Order 52 rule 15(2) empowers the Court to extend time for ""special reasons"". In Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195 the Full Court said that ""special reasons"": is an expression describing a flexible discretionary power, but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify a departure, in the particular circumstances, from the ordinary rule prescribing a period within which an appeal must be filed and served. In my view the Minister has sufficiently explained the short delay in filing the notice of appeal. In several cases an extension of time has been granted where there has been a short delay caused by reliance on incorrect advice as to time limits. Jess v Scott was such a case. Prospects of success Section 494B of the Act provides in part: (1) For the purposes of provisions of this Act or the regulations that: (a) require or permit the Minister to give a document to a person (the recipient ); and (b) state that the Minister must do so by one of the methods specified in this section; the methods are as follows. ... (4) Another method consists of the Minister dating the document, and then dispatching it: (a) within 3 working days (in the place of dispatch) of the date of the document; and (b) by prepaid post or by other prepaid means; and (c) to: (i) the last address for service provided to the Minister by the recipient for the purposes of receiving documents; or (ii) the last residential or business address provided to the Minister by the recipient for the purposes of receiving documents. Regulation 2.16(3) of the Regulations requires the Minister to notify an applicant of a decision to refuse to grant a visa by one of the methods in s 494B."
Case9578,cited,Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151,"By its notice of motion, the applicant sought its costs of the motion on an indemnity basis. Counsel properly did not press this application today. It is true that the applicant sough to put the respondent on notice that there were problems with his pleading late last year when it wrote its letter of 22 December 2005. Ordinarily, however, costs in this court are awarded on a party and party basis. The respondent has made a good faith effort to respond to the allegations against him. In Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 ("" Re Wilcox "") at 156-157, Cooper and Merkel JJ said that: (a) the court ought not to depart from the usual party and party basis for costs unless this was warranted by the circumstances of the case; and (b) these circumstances arise ""as and when the justice of the case so requires or where there may be some special or unusual feature in the case to justify the court in departing from the usual course"". I do not find that the circumstances of this case warrant a departure from the usual course. 12 Nevertheless, the applicant has been successful in its motion and, notwithstanding the respondent's opposition, costs should follow the event. I propose to order that the respondent pay the costs of the motion on a party and party basis. 13 I also propose to direct that the parties file and serve submissions on the following two questions: whether or not the proceeding should be transferred to the Queensland District Registry; and (2) whether or not the proceeding should be referred to mediation under O 72 of the Federal Court Rules. I have already raised these matters with the parties in the course of the recent directions hearing. I would also make a further direction in the terms discussed in court today in relation to matters presently the subject of a confidentiality order."

Case20553,applied,Sankey v Whitlam and Ors [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1,"A Court will not order the production of a document, even if relevant and admissible, if it would be injurious to the public interest to disclose it: see Alister and Ors v The Queen [1983] HCA 45 ; (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 450-1; Sankey v Whitlam and Ors [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 per Gibbs ACJ at 38; The Commonwealth of Australia v Northern Land Council and Anor [1993] HCA 24 ; (1993) 176 CLR 604; Young v Quin (1985) 4 FCR 483; Attorney-General for New South Wales v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 674-6. 47 It is the duty of the court, and not the privilege of the executive government, to decide whether a document will be produced or withheld: see Sankey v Whitlam at 38. An objection may be taken to the production of a document because it would be against the public interest to disclose its contents, or because the document belongs to a class of documents which, in the public interest, ought not be produced: see Sankey v Whitlam at 39. The category of documents to which the 'class' rule applies is relatively narrow, and includes documents such as cabinet minutes and documents which relate to the framing of government policy at a high level: see Sankey v Whitlam at 39. The claim in the present case is made on the basis of the contents of the draft reports, and not on the basis that the draft reports are a class to which public interest immunity attaches."
Case10789,followed,Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386,"respect of each of the offers upon which Flottweg relied, Olivaylle submitted that, even if it were a necessary conclusion flowing from my dismissal of the application that it was worse off than the position offered by those letters, there was no presumption flowing from this that costs taxed on an indemnity basis must be awarded. The importance afforded by Lindgren J in NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (No 11) [2001] FCA 480 ; (2001) 109 FCR 77 at 98, [88] to ""sufficient particularity"" in relation to an explanation for an offer and ""inevitability of failure"" was stressed. So, too, was stressed the need to remind myself that it was for Flottweg as offeror to show that the conduct of Olivaylle as offeree in rejecting any ""Calderbank"" offer was unreasonable, the application by Weinberg J in Alpine Hardwood (Aust) Pty Ltd v Hardys Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 224 ; (2002) 190 ALR 121 at [35] of the Full Court's statement to this effect in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] [218] being cited in support. Flottweg's submissions did not gainsay the matters of principle for which the cases relied upon by Olivaylle stood, only the application of those principles in the circumstances of this particular case. In particular, Flottweg accepted that the mere fact that the result at trial left Olivaylle worse off than any pre-trial offer carried with it no presumptive entitlement to an award of indemnity costs. Rather, it was submitted that the question was whether the rejection of the offers (or at least one of them) was unreasonable or imprudent, the discussion and conclusions reached by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [59] to [63] with respect to Black v Lipovac , supra and other authorities being adopted. Flottweg further submitted that, while it may not have been unreasonable or imprudent for Olivaylle to have instituted or, as the case may be, continued the litigation in the absence of one or more of the offers it made, at least one of those offers constituted a fair commercial compromise such that it was unreasonable or imprudent to institute or continue the litigation in the face of that offer. That sentiment, it was submitted, was evident in the approach taken by Emmett J in Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [17] . I am bound to follow matters of principle enunciated by the Full Court. In that regard, it may be, as Buchanan J highlights in the following passage from his judgment in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 at 597, [22] , that there is a difference in opinion at intermediate appellate level as to whether, for the purpose of satisfying a condition precedent to the awarding of indemnity costs and as an alternative to ""imprudent"", the rejection of an offer of compromise should be able to be described as ""unreasonable"" or ""plainly unreasonable"": In Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 ( Dukemaster) Sundberg and Emmett JJ said, in a case like the present where O 23 r 11 did not apply because an applicant had been wholly unsuccessful, that an applicant for a more generous award of costs than party-party costs 'must show that the rejection of the offer was imprudent or plainly unreasonable' (see at [7]). There has been doubt expressed about the soundness of the statement in Dukemaster that rejection of an offer, if unreasonable, must be 'plainly unreasonable' in the light of the earlier judgment of a Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] [218], to which Wilcox J also referred in Coshott (see Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 at [59] [62]). In the earlier of the Full Court authorities, Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at 432-433, [218] , the point was made that the conduct of an offeree need not be ""plainly unreasonable"" in order to warrant the ordering of indemnity costs because ""To adopt an especially high standard of unreasonableness would operate as a fetter on the discretion to award indemnity costs and diminish the effectiveness of the Calderbank offer as an incentive to settlement."" I respectfully agree and, for that reason, would choose to follow the earlier Full Court authority were that to be critical to the resolution of the costs application. It is not though because in both Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 and Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 the alternative of imprudent rejection was acknowledged. Like Buchanan J in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) and, as his Honour noted (at [22]), like Heerey J in AFP Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [24] [25], it is sufficient to assess whether the rejection of any of the offers was, ""imprudent"". That basis of assessment accords with the exemplar given by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited , which I have already noted, whose judgment, as Heerey J acknowledged in AFP Properties (ibid), is the locus classicus on the subject."
Case5384,referred to,Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society [1999] FCA 718 ; (1999) 217 ALR 495,"was referred to a number of authorities, but I do not need to go through them in detail. The general principles are well known. They are summarised by Branson J in Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society (1999) 217 ALR 495 ; [1999] FCA 718 at [6] - [9] . They were applied by Kenny J in Fleming's Nurseries Pty Ltd v Hannaford [2008] FCA 591. Orders separating liability from damages or an account of profits are often made in intellectual property cases. In Liberty Financial Pty Ltd v Scott [2003] FCA 226 at [40] , Weinberg J expressed the view that intellectual property cases, or at least intellectual property cases other than patent cases, should be treated no differently from other commercial cases. I do not need to enter that debate because this is not an intellectual property case. The claims made by the applicant include claims made under the Corporations Act and the TPA. In any event, there is no fixed and invariable rule that an order for the determination of separate questions will be made in intellectual property cases."
Case10076,cited,Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550,"to the second point, it was submitted that it is obvious that the communication was relevant to the inquiry being undertaken by the Tribunal. A decision-maker is obliged to disclose adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made: Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601 at 631 [123] , per McHugh J and 1005 [227], per Kirby J; Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 629; Minister for Local Government v South Sydney City Council [2002] NSWCA 288 ; (2002) 55 NSWLR 381 at 438 [260] , per Mason P. Accordingly, a breach of the rules of procedural fairness occurred. By failing to afford the applicant procedural fairness, the Tribunal committed an excess of jurisdiction and hence an error of law."
Case19941,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 21 FCR 193,"There are a number of reasons for this. First, any suggestion that a sitting government would act, or be likely to act, in a particular way based upon expressions of a particular point of view must usually be rejected. Although his Honour was dealing with principles of administrative law, it seems to me that what Gummow J said in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 21 FCR 193 at 207 211 applies equally in the present context. A discretion conferred by statute is to be exercised on a proper understanding of what the statute requires and, ordinarily, is not to be confined by a statement or decision which forecloses the discretion. 862 It seems to me to follow from this that any suggestion of a lost opportunity to obtain the benefit of Mr Hamill's support cannot be an opportunity which the law would recognise. 863 Second, there is nothing to suggest that a long lease would have been negotiated in the available time. It took nearly three years for the parties to agree the final terms of the three year lease that was the subject of the 4 April 1993 Heads. The good faith negotiations for a new lease which commenced in May 1996 had not culminated in an agreement after about 10 months of negotiations."
Case8851,cited,"Firebelt Pty Ltd v Brambles Australia Ltd [2002] HCA 21 ; (2002) 188 ALR 280 , (2002) 76 ALJR 816","The position established in Minnesota Mining [1980] HCA 9 ; 144 CLR 253 was of relatively short duration. Until then, the wider view of Williams J in HPM Industries Pty Ltd v Gerard Industries Ltd [1957] HCA 47 ; (1957) 98 CLR 424 had applied (see Graham Hart (1971) Pty Ltd v SW Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 61 ; (1978) 141 CLR 305 per Aickin J at 329 330). The 1990 Act widens the prior art base, but does not change the nature of the issue. Leaving aside Aktiebolaget [2002] HCA 59 ; 212 CLR 411 , the principal survey of the topic by the High Court since Minnesota Mining [1980] HCA 9 ; 144 CLR 253 was in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] HCA 21 ; (2007) 235 ALR 202 , (2007) 81 ALJR 1070 , particularly at [31] [66]. That case did not involve the problem that arises here. It is noteworthy that the Court said of the 1990 provisions (at [127]): ""As stated above, by enlarging the prior art base through including relevant prior disclosures beyond those disclosures proven to be part of the common general knowledge, these provisions raise the threshold for inventiveness. However, the idea remains that the prior disclosures to be taken into account, even as enlarged by s 7(3), are being considered for a particular purpose. That purpose is the purpose of looking forward from the prior art base to see what a person skilled in the relevant art is likely to have done when faced with a similar problem which the patentee claims to have solved with the invention."" (Emphasis added.) (cf Firebelt Pty Ltd v Brambles Australia Ltd [2002] HCA 21 ; (2002) 188 ALR 280 , (2002) 76 ALJR 816 at [33] as to combination patents.) The applicants do not seek to utilise the contents of the prior specification as an admission as to common general knowledge (cf Lockwood Security Products [2007] HCA 21 ; 235 ALR 202 , 81 ALJR 1070 at [105] [109]). Rather, it is a statement of the nature of the inventive step that is claimed (cf in another context, Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Ltd [1959] HCA 71 ; (1959) 102 CLR 232)."
Case20977,discussed,Franbridge Pty Ltd v Societ&eacute; &amp; Generale Finance Corporation Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 304,"Other limits on the court's power to give directions under s 424 have been discussed in the authorities. In particular, the authorities make it clear that it is not appropriate for the court to give directions about the commercial propriety or reasonableness of a transaction that the receiver proposes to enter into: see One.Tel at 91 [30], 92 [33] and 93 [38]; and Best &amp; Less at 247, 249 and 250. In Franbridge Pty Ltd v Societ&eacute; &amp; Generale Finance Corporation Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 304 (' Franbridge') , Einfeld J refused to make directions to the effect that a particular transaction was not improper and, more particularly, that the receiver had acted reasonably: at 308, 309. 35 The cases decided under s 424 show a distinct disinclination on the part of courts to make any direction that approves, or appears to approve, the undertaking of a commercial transaction by a receiver. Likewise, the courts have resisted the notion that they should make a direction under s 424 that a receiver has acted reasonably in the performance of his duties pursuant to s 420A. There is a good reason for this caution. Unless directions are carefully worded, they might give a false public perception that the court is placing its imprimatur upon a particular transaction: see Lockhart J in Best &amp; Less at 249 and Franbridge , where Einfeld J said at 308: 'The court should not be asked to make orders, give directions or make declarations that would convey to the public, quite wrongly, for the reasons Lockhart and Hodgson JJ point out, that the court is giving judicial approval to the sale after due consideration in accordance with regular procedures when, however the words are hedged, in fact it is not doing that at all.' 37 In the present case, the deed of charge dated 17 October 2003 provides that the receiver and manager from appointment is the agent of the chargor, Lake Federation. As Hodson J pointed out in Vartex , the consequence of that agency is that the sale of property by the receivers and managers to a company associated with the appointor does not infringe the mortgage principle: see also Franbridge at 308 and Actwane at [13]-[15]."
Case8535,cited,The British South Africa Company v The Companhia de Mo&ccedil;ambique [1893] AC 602,"In The British South Africa Company v The Companhia de Mo&ccedil;ambique [1893] AC 602 ( Mo&ccedil;ambique ), the House of Lords held that the Supreme Court of Judicature had no jurisdiction to entertain an action to recover damages for a trespass to land situate abroad. Mo&ccedil;ambique recognised a distinction between ""transitory"" and ""local"" actions. The English courts would exercise jurisdiction in respect of the former but not the latter. Actions in which title to land or infringement of rights and interest in real property were in issue were prime examples of local actions. 38 The "" Mo&ccedil;ambique rule"" has been held to apply to intellectual property rights. In Potter v The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd [1906] HCA 88 ; (1906) 3 CLR 479 ( Potter ), the High Court held that a cause of action for infringement in New South Wales by a Victorian company carrying on mining operations in New South Wales, of the plaintiff's patent issued under the Patents Act 1899 (NSW), was not justiciable in Victoria. 40 In Tritech Technology Pty Ltd v Gordon (2000) 48 IPR 52, Finkelstein J recognised that the Mo&ccedil;ambique rule was subject to exceptions. 41 In Potter the High Court described one exception to the Mo&ccedil;ambique rule (at 498-499 per Griffith CJ): The Courts will no doubt entertain such a question of title if it arises merely incidentally in a case in which the foundation of the jurisdiction is a personal obligation arising from contract or quasi-contractual relationship between the parties."
Case15021,cited,Spain v Union Steamship Co of New Zealand Limited [1923] HCA 21 ; (1923) 32 CLR 138,"is concerned that the discharge of Mr Ireland from bankruptcy does not excuse it from the requirement to seek leave to prosecute its claim for fraud in the civil action. It is concerned, moreover, that the claim for fraud may arguably be a claim for liquidated damages comprising the purchase price paid by it to Mr Ireland at the direction of Acarus to acquire a 30% interest in the tenements. So the damages claim, albeit based in fraud, may give rise to a 'provable debt' within the meaning of s 82. To the extent that the claim seeks recovery of moneys paid by way of the purchase price for the tenements, it is arguably a claim for liquidated damages. As was said in Spain v Union Steamship Co of New Zealand Limited [1923] HCA 21 ; (1923) 32 CLR 138 (at 142 per Knox CJ and Starke J): is well said by Mr Odgers (Pleading and Practice, 5 th ed, p 41), ""whenever the amount to which the plaintiff is entitled ... can be ascertained by calculation or fixed by any scale of charges, or other positive data, it is ... liquidated"".' On the other hand, in Cornelius v Barewa Oil and Mining NL (In liq) (1982) 42 ALR 83 Burt CJ observed that (at 84): claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation remains a claim or demand for unliquidated damages even if the relief as claimed is for a liquidated amount.'"
Case23189,cited,State of New South Wales v Swiss Bank Corporation (2001) 39 NSWLR 350,"to interest, the rule appears to be that as regards the judgment in the foreign currency, interest should be calculated at the rate applicable for that foreign currency. In Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd (No 2) [1977] QB 489 at 497 Bristow J held that the plaintiff, who obtained judgment in Swiss francs, was entitled to interest at a rate at which someone could reasonably have borrowed Swiss francs in Switzerland at simple interest. The same approach has been adopted by Australian courts: see eg Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nurenburg AG v Altikar Pty Ltd (1984) 3 NSWLR 152 ; Swiss Bank Corporation v State Bank of New South Wales (1993) 33 NSWLR 63 affirmed on appeal State of New South Wales v Swiss Bank Corporation (2001) 39 NSWLR 350. In Vlasons Shipping Inc v Neuchatel Swiss General Insurance Co Limited [1998] VSC 135 , Byrne J applied the US prime borrowing rate in respect of a judgment in US dollars. This decision was reversed on appeal, but on other grounds: Neuchatel Swiss General Insurance Co v Vlasons Shipping Inc [2001] VSCA 25. I would also apply that rate calculated on a monthly basis. In the case of judgment for damages to be entered in Australian dollars, the practice is to adopt the rate prevailing in the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the Federal Court is sitting: Namol Pty Ltd v AW Baulderstone Pty Ltd (No 2) [1993] FCA 606 ; (1993) 47 FCR 388 at 389."
Case10419,referred to,"BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union of Workers (2006) 151 IR 361","There is a body of authority bearing on the foregoing subject to which I have already made reference starting at [26] of these reasons, for instance Stevens, Hollis and Damevski. Attention was drawn by CAO also to ACT Visiting Medical Officers Association v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2006) 153 IR 228 and BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union of Workers (2006) 151 IR 361, which will shortly be discussed. The majority of those decisions were made in the broader context of determining whether a particular worker was an employee or else an independent contractor of the beneficiary of his or her work. 134 The effect and operation of that line of authority may be outlined as follows: (i) the totality of the relationship is to be considered; thus in Stevens , the following appears in the reasons for judgment of Mason J (as he then was) at 24: 'But the existence of control, whilst significant, is not the sole criterion by which to gauge whether a relationship is one of employment. The approach of this Court has been to regard it merely as one of a number of indicia which must be considered in the determination of that question. Other relevant matters include, but are not limited to, the mode of remuneration, the provision and maintenance of equipment, the obligation to work, the hours of work and provision for holidays, the deduction of income tax and the delegation of work by the putative employee.' To that dictum may be added what I have earlier cited at [26] of my reasons from the joint judgment of Wilson and Dawson JJ in Stevens ; (ii) in the most recent of the foregoing five authorities above recorded ( ACT Visiting Medical Officers) , a Full Federal Court comprising Wilcox J, myself and Stone J in a joint judgment applied the principles emerging from analogous authority for the purpose of characterising relevantly the visiting medical officers engaged by public hospital authorities to provide medical services to public patients; the Full Court observed the practical realities inherent in the circumstance that in the course of their treatment of patients undertaken at the hospitals, the visiting medical doctors 'moved seamlessly between patients in the two groups' , being both private and public patients, as an integral part of the businesses that each of those doctors individually carried on; (iii) in BHP Billiton the person at the centre of the dispute had been employed by BHP Billiton and its precursors as a locomotive driver until he was made redundant in 1999; in 2001 he applied successfully for employment with a labour hire company then supplying contract drivers to BHP Billiton; from that time to 2004, and while directly employed by the labour hire company but working at BHP Billiton, he applied for advertised direct employee position with BHP Billiton on four separate occasions but was unsuccessful each time; the Union alleged that BHP Billiton had unreasonably refused to employ him, and that he was in any event jointly in the employ of entities inclusive of BHP Billiton; declaratory relief was sought to that latter effect, as was also an order in any event that such person be employed by BHP Billiton on an award; in the course of decision-making the Industrial Appeal Court of Western Australia was required to consider the Union's case that the person concerned was an employee of BHP Billiton according to ordinary concepts; the Union submitted that the correct approach to deciding the question as to the existence or otherwise of an employment relationship was to have regard to the totality of the relationship, citing inter alia in that context Hollis and Stevens . At [114] in the reasons for judgment of Le Miere J, with whose reasons Wheeler J agreed and Pullin J at least substantially agreed, it was observed as follows: 'In Hollis v Vabu and Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd the High Court set out the common law principles for distinguishing between an employee and a contractor. These principles do not embody a definition of employment as such. They rely instead on a test which involves the consideration of a number of established factors or indicia, some of which are characteristic of a contract of service and others of which suggest a non-employment relationship. The task of the court which must assess the employment status of a worker is to consider the parties' relationship in light of each of these indicia and to determine, on balance, into which legal category the relationship falls. The exercise is not a mechanical one. Rather it is a matter of obtaining the overall picture from the accumulation of detail.' 135 CAO submitted that the operation relevantly of the reasons for the respective decisions in Stevens, Hollis, Damevski, ACT Visiting Medical Officers and BHP Billiton , somewhat repetitively as in the preceding paragraph, as follows: (i) the totality of the relationship in issue between the parties is to be considered; (ii) the measure of control exercised by a putative employer over a worker is a prominent factor but not the sole criterion; and (iii) other factors include the manner in which work is performed, the mode of remuneration, the provision and maintenance of equipment, the obligation to work, the hours of work and entitlements to leave, the deduction of income tax, the delegation of work by the putative employee, the presentation to the public of the putative employee as an emanation of the putative employer, the supply of a uniform and the description by the parties of their relationship in the contract the subject of consideration. 136 CAO emphasised that the importance of those factors will vary with the circumstances, no single factor being normally determinative, and that a balancing exercise is to be undertaken in relation to all of the relevant factors ( ACT Visiting Medical Officers at [19]-[20], [27] and [30] and BHP Billiton at [114]). CAO pointed out additionally that the fact that a party is benefited by the activities of a person is not a sufficient indication that the person is an employee, pointing thereby to Hollis at [40], where in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, the following observation was made: 'Thus, by itself, the circumstance that the business enterprise of a party said to be an employer is benefited by the activities of the person in question cannot be a sufficient indication that this person is an employee.' 192 I think that CAO is correct in its comprehensive case advanced, in a sense in the alternative, to the effect that the conduct and functions of the respective parties were not otherwise indicative of an employment relationship between the applicants and CAO, having regard to the totality thereof, and having regard in particular also to the criteria apparent from the authorities to which I have already referred, inclusive in particular of Stevens, Hollis, Damevski, ACT Visiting Medical Officers and BHP Billiton , keeping in mind in so doing that it is labour hire arrangements that are here inherently involved. I would acknowledge the relevance and force of all of the factors formulated in [135], each having varying significance without each being determinative in any fulfilment of the need for undertaking a balancing exercise in relation to all relevant factors bearing upon resolution of the principal issue arising as the existence or otherwise of relationships of employment. I would further acknowledge the prospective operation, in cases such as the present, of the principles enunciated generally in Mason and Humberstone , as well as perhaps more specifically in Drake , and additionally of course in Forstaff where reference to and examination of authority is undertaken by way of focus on labour hire arrangements."

He held, correctly, that the country information fell within the exception set out in s 424A(3)(b). His Honour accepted that the Tribunal relied in part on the information that the appellant left China legally, that the information was provided in the protection visa application and that the appellant's reference in his review application to the statement in the protection visa application did not refer to that information. However, his Honour found the appellant did provide the information that he left China legally at the hearing before the Tribunal. The Tribunal had asked specific questions about the appellant leaving China legally and the appellant had answered those questions. He held that the appellant would have clearly understood the nature and importance of what he was saying and that he had not only acknowledged the information in his protection visa application but ""volunteered"" that information as to how he left legally.

Case23930,followed,Delnorth Pty Ltd v State Bank of New South Wales (1995) 17 ACSR 379,"notion of not warranting further investigation has assumed importance in a particular class of case. Where the dispute relates to a simple question of construction that can be decided following a short hearing and there is no factual issue to be resolved, the Court will decide the question and, if the construction is against the company, the dispute will not be classified as ""genuine"": see Delnorth Pty Ltd v State Bank of New South Wales (1995) 17 ACSR 379 at 384-5 ( Delnorth ); Lifestyle Retirement Projects No 2 Pty Ltd v Parisi Homes Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 705 at [16] - [17] ; BBX Holdings Ltd v American Home Assurance Co [2007] NSWSC 549 at [15] - [17] . In the same vein, in the earlier case of Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 785 , McLelland CJ in Eq said that the expression ""genuine dispute"" connotes ""a plausible contention requiring investigation "" (at 787 my emphasis). Counsel for Lodge submitted that it sufficed that Lodge raised an arguable construction. I accept that counsel for Lodge did raise a construction that was arguable, at least on the face of the provision, but the cases cited above show that this is not the end of the matter. The following oft cited passage from the judgment of Cohen J in Delnorth (at 384-385) is pertinent: Section 459H(1) refers to the court finding that there is a genuine dispute. The parties have argued this case on the issue of whether the proper construction of the agreement and the facts results in the plaintiff owing money to the defendant. The facts were not in dispute and there was thus no question of whose evidence would be accepted on a final hearing. Under the previous legislation, when there was a claim that there was a bona fide dispute on substantial grounds as to the debt claimed, the court could decide that dispute if it arose from a question of law or was of short compass. See, for example, Offshore Oil NL v Acron pacific Ltd (1984) 2 ACLC 8. I consider that under the provisions of the Corporations Law, the same approach can be taken. Although questions of disputed fact will not be decided on an application to set aside a statutory demand, the issue of whether there is a genuine dispute can be resolved on that application where the question arises on a short point of law or the construction of documents or agreed facts. In Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 785 ; 12 ACLC 669 , McLelland CJ in Eq said that the expression ""genuine dispute"" connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation. Where no further investigation is required, I consider that the court on an application under s 459G may decide as a matter of law if there is a genuine dispute. The occasions when this is possible may be few, but in my view this is one of them."

See Collector of Customs (Tas) v Flinders Island Community Association (1985) 7 FCR 205.

Case9767,distinguished,Neowarra v Western Australia [2003] FCA 1402,"The Commonwealth cites several first instance decisions as authorities to the contrary of Ward (FC) (No 2) . Leaving aside the fact that I am bound by Ward (FC) (No 2), each of these cases is distinguishable. In Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2004] FCA 298 , Cooper J was concerned with native title rights over certain waters which rights were expressed to be good against all the world other than people exercising public rights of fishing, navigation or innocent passage, or other rights lawfully conferred by statute. Cooper J, with respect, correctly considered that a formulation in these terms amounted to an attempt to control access to and use of the land in a manner that was inconsistent with the reasoning in Ward (HC) : see at [188]. Lardil Peoples v Queensland did not involve any native title right of the kind dealt with either in para 5(e) of the determination in Ward (FC) (No 2) or in the determination made in De Rose (FC) (No 2). Similarly, the passages cited from Daniel v Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 , at [134]-[136], and Neowarra v Western Australia [2003] FCA 1402 , at [475], do not directly bear on a native title right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of land by Aboriginal peoples bound by traditional laws and customs."
Case410,discussed,South Australia v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 7 ; (1992) 174 CLR 235,"The authorities cited by the applicants are St Lucia Usines and Estates Company Limited v Colonial Treasurer of St Lucia [1924] AC 508 ( St Lucia ) at 512; Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Limited [1938] HCA 69 ; (1938) 63 CLR 108 ( Carden's Case ) at 155; Permanent Trustee Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1940) 6 ATD 5 ( Prior's Case ) at 13; South Australia v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 7 ; (1992) 174 CLR 235 at 253; and Bowaters Sales Co Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1958) 38 TC 593 ( Bowaters ) at 597 599.

Case13690,applied,The Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia Limited) [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407,"respondent submits that when one has regard to the fact that the concept employed by the parties in their consent orders eschewed the broader concept of deceptive similarity as explained in The Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia Limited) [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407, it is at least open to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether what the respondent did, as previously found by me (in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 3) [2006] FCA 602 at [12] ) was in fact a use that was the same or substantially identical with either of the registered marks. (The respondent does not accept that that finding was one which should have been arrived at on the facts, but has left such rights as he may have to deal with that matter to be the subject of an appeal rather than seeking leave to reopen generally.) The respondent referred to the decision of Windeyer J in the Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia Limited) (1961) 109 CLR at 414-415, where his Honour considered the concept of 'substantial identity' within the meaning of the then Trademarks Act 1955 (Cth) and the decided cases on those words, both here and in England, in contradistinction to the other concept used in the legislation of 'deceptive similarity'. He explained that the task was to compare side by side the similarities and differences noted and the importance of those assessed having regard to the essential features of the registered mark and the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from that comparison. He said that the judgment ought to be by eye alone for the purposes of determining substantial identity, but noted that in an animated depiction where matters do not stand still fleeting glimpses of substantial identity were not enough, although the position may be different with regard to deceptive similarity. Since order 1 does not refer to the latter concept I need not deal with it. Given that these are proceedings which are criminal in nature in which the liberty of the subject is in issue, it seems to me that I should err on the side of caution in construing order 1. Having now had the benefit of the argument put by the respondent, I am of opinion that the words 'substantially identical' as used in that order could be construed as denoting the concept in s 120 of the Trademarks Act 1995 (Cth) and as expounded in judicial decisions and that it is a reasonable construction of order 1 to read it in the way submitted by the respondent today. That is so even though this is not necessarily the only construction that one would make. That is to say, the parties were identifying a limited legal concept as defining the extent of the protection that the order was seeking to give to the applicant's two trademarks and they accepted that the particular depiction, included as part of order 1, was an infringement of them. While that is not, for the reasons I have given in my earlier judgements, the construction which I would place on the words, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, having now reflected upon the new argument put by the respondent through his counsel today, that that is the only way one would read the consent orders in light of the heads of agreement which the respondent signed on 12 December 2005."
Case7752,discussed,Fernando v Commissioner of Police (1995) 36 NSWLR 567 ,"writing what appears at [68]-[80] above, I have become aware that the issue of comity has been the subject of considerable judicial discussion to which the parties did not refer. In Fernando v Commissioner of Police (1995) 36 NSWLR 567 ( Fernando ) the New South Wales Court of Appeal (NSWCA) considered the matter. The question was whether the NSWCA should follow a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Franklin (1979) 22 SASR 101 ( Franklin ) on a statutory provision in substantially identical words to those of the relevant New South Wales statute. All three members of that Court thought that the South Australian Full Court's construction of the provision had been wrong. Priestley JA described (at 584) the ""rule of comity"" as a ""sound one for most purposes"", such that the NSWCA ""usually follows the decisions of courts of like position in other Australian jurisdictions on similar points"". Priestley JA said (also at 584) that the reasons favouring the construction of the provision which his Honour thought to be right, were ""so strong"" that an exception should be made to the ""rule of comity"". Powell JA was of a similar view, going as far as to describe the South Australian decision as ""clearly wrong"" (at 593). However, Clarke JA, while also preferring the construction favoured by Priestley JA and Powell JA, considered (at 591) that the question was one on which minds could reasonably differ and that Franklin was not ""plainly wrong"". Applying as a matter of comity a rule that the NSWCA should follow a decision of another Australian intermediate appellate court on the construction of the substantially identical statutory provision unless ""it is convinced that the earlier decision is clearly wrong or that considerations of justice require the court to decline to apply the decision of the other court"" (at 589-590), his Honour decided that Franklin should be followed. In R v Dyson (1997) 68 SASR 156 ( Dyson ) the Supreme Court of South Australia Court of Criminal Appeal was specially constituted as a bench of five members to consider the conflict between Franklin and Fernando . Bollen J distinguished Fernando . All other four judges, and Bollen J in the alternative, considered that Franklin was correct and Fernando incorrect."

Case24954,discussed,GE Capital Corporate Finance Group Ltd v Bankers Trust Co [1995] 1 WLR 172; [1995] 2 All ER 993,"The respondent submits that the course it has taken accords with a longstanding practice as to the masking or sealing up of documents on the ground that the concealed parts of a document are irrelevant. It submits that the oath of the party giving discovery is conclusive unless there are grounds for concluding that proper discovery has not been given (see O 15 r 8). That means, so it was submitted by the respondent, that it is conclusive not only as to whether there are any other relevant documents but also as to whether the sections of a document sealed up or concealed are relevant or irrelevant. A clear statement of the rule of practice upon which the respondent relies was made by Hoffman LJ in GE Capital Corporate Finance Group Ltd v Bankers Trust Co [1995] 1 WLR 172; [1995] 2 All ER 993 ("" GE Capital "") at 174; 994-995: It has long been the practice that a party is entitled to seal up or cover up parts of a document which he claims to be irrelevant. Bray's Digest of the Law of Discovery, 2nd ed. (1910), pp. 55 56 puts the matter succinctly: ""Generally speaking, any part of a document may be sealed up or otherwise concealed under the same conditions as a whole document may be withheld from production; the party's oath for this purpose is as valid in the one case as in the other. The practice is either to schedule to the affidavit of documents those parts only which are relevant, or to schedule the whole document and to seal up those parts which are sworn to be irrelevant; ..."" The oath of the party giving discovery is conclusive, ""unless the court can be satisfied--not on a conflict of affidavits, but either from the documents produced or from anything in the affidavit made by the defendant, or by any admission by him in the pleadings, or necessarily from the circumstances of the case--that the affidavit does not truly state that which it ought to state:"" per Cotton L.J. in Jones v. Andrews (1888) 58 L.T. 601, 604. 18 The applicant submits that the rule of practice identified in GE Capital does not apply under the Rules of this Court. He submits that a party making discovery is not entitled to seal up or mask parts or sections of a document unless he has the consent of the other party or the permission of the Court. He refers to Telstra Corp v Australis Media Holdings (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division, McLelland CJ in Eq, 10 February 1997) ("" Telstra Corp ""); Gray v Associated Book Publishers (Aust) Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1045 ("" Gray "") and Fig Tree Developments Ltd v Australian Property Custodian Holdings Ltd [2008] FCA 1041. In Gray , Branson J said (at [15]-[16]): 15 In my view, where in this Court categories of documents are required to be discovered and thereafter made available for inspection, the true obligation on the party giving discovery is the same as that identified by McLelland CJ in Eq in Telstra Corporation v Australis Media Holdings by reference to Pt 23 of the New South Wales Supreme Court Rules . The Chief Judge there said: ""Under the new discovery rules, Pt 23 of the Supreme Court Rules , ... classes of documents required to be discovered may be, and were in the present case, specified not by reference to relevance to a fact or facts in issue, but by description of the nature of the documents, rendering it unnecessary to consider questions of relevance to an issue, as such. If in such cases the party giving discovery desires to withhold, by making [sic] or otherwise, production of part of a discoverable document on the ground that that part does not contribute to the satisfaction of any of the criteria by reference to which the class of documents is described, then it may be that a case can be made for giving effect to that desire, but in my view, unless there is some relevant qualification in the order for discovery, the order requires that the whole document be produced unless there is an agreement to the contrary by the party to which discovery is being made, or unless relief from the requirement, for example by making [sic] certain portions is obtained from the Court. 16 The respondents did not obtain the agreement of the applicant to the masking of portions of their discovered documents, nor did they seek relief from the Court from their prima facie obligations to allow full inspection of their discovered documents. Nonetheless, having regard to the course of argument on the applicant's notice of motion, it seems appropriate now to give consideration to the claim of the respondents that the masking undertaken by them is appropriate in the circumstances and ought to be authorised by the Court. 24 An order for limited discovery is, or is becoming, the more usual order made by this Court. In the case of such an order, cases such as Telstra Corp and Gray suggest the rule of practice referred to in GE Capital does not apply because the nature of the order (that is, discovery by classes or categories of documents identified in the order) is such that the party giving discovery does not have to consider questions of relevance to an issue. Had I made such an order in this case, I would have been disposed to follow those cases. Perhaps, as Sundberg J observed in Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1335 (at [26]), in practical terms the difference between the two approaches will not often be of great significance. In this case it does make a difference because the respondent did not seek to justify the masking of the documents beyond its reliance on the oath of discovery and, although in some cases ( GE Capital is an example) the Court is able to say from its own examination of the masked documents that there are no grounds to think the masked portions are relevant, I am not satisfied that, if I had to address the question, I could reach that conclusion in this case. 25 The difficulty facing the applicant is that I did not make an order for limited discovery in this case. I made an order for general discovery in the sense of an order which imported the criteria in O 15 r 2(3). Relevance is not determined by the order but by the party giving discovery, having regard to the issues in the case and the criteria in O 15 r 2(3). In those circumstances I see no reason not to apply the longstanding rule of practice referred to in GE Capital . It seems to me that the only difference between a party swearing that there are no other relevant documents and swearing that masked parts or sections of a document are not relevant is perhaps that in the latter case there is an increased possibility of error in excluding parts or sections of a document which put the disclosed parts of a document in their proper context. That, no doubt, is a problem the Court must guard against, as it has had to since the longstanding rule of practice was formulated. However, it is not suggested that any Rule of Court has been made in response to a perceived need to overcome difficulties of this nature."

Case10176,cited,Hanave Pty Limited v LFOT Pty Ltd (formerly Jagar Products Pty Ltd) (in liq) [2003] FCA 1154,"general principles applicable to s 51A have been helpfully summarised by Finn J in HK Frost Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) v Darvall McCutcheon (a firm) [1999] FCA 795 at [6] to [11] as follows (citations omitted): [6] (1) It is well settled that the objective of provisions of this type is to compensate an applicant for the loss it suffers in being kept out of its money or damages ... [7] (2) The award of interest under s 51A(1) is mandatory ""unless good cause is shown to the contrary"" ... Ordinarily it will be for the respondent to establish such ""good cause"" ... Furthermore, it is open to the court, for example, to take into account such considerations of public policy as may be relevant in the circumstances ... [8] (3) Though the matter is and remains one of judicial discretion, it is the usual practice of this Court in applying s 51A(1) to adopt the rates of interest applied by the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which this Court is dealing with the matter ... though, no less so than a State court, the Court may then depart from those rates as a matter of discretion given the circumstances of the case ... A justification for this practice is that it helps to ensure that damages are awarded on the same basis at least as to rates of interest whether a proceeding is instituted in this Court or in a Supreme Court. Parity in the making of interest awards will, though, often be unattainable because the legislation of a particular State may prescribe varying periods for which pre-judgment interest may be awarded (depending upon the nature of the cause of action in question) that differ from what is allowable under s 51A(1) ... [9] (4) Given the variations in the language and structure of the pre-judgment interest provisions of the various Australian States, care must be taken in using the decisions of State courts on their own statutes to elucidate the meaning of s 51A(1). For example, for the purposes of s 51A(1) the formula ""good cause to the contrary"" would appear on its proper construction to mean only good cause for not allowing interest at all ... The subsection itself otherwise provides discretions as to the rate and the period of an interest award. In contrast, the same formula as used in s 58 of the Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic) has been interpreted to mean good cause for allowing interest otherwise than in accordance with the terms of that section ... But s 58 , notably, does not provide the same discretions as does s 51A(1). [10] (5) It is neither possible nor desirable to define what will constitute ""good cause"" disentitling a party to interest under s 51A(1) ; each case must be considered by reference to its own circumstances ... [11] (6) There is considerable diversity in judicial opinion as to the extent to which, if at all, the rate or (more usually) the period selected for an interest award should as a discretionary matter be moulded adversely to a party that delays in the prosecution or defence of a claim where no resultant detriment to the other party is shown ... Nonetheless, insofar as concerns a successful applicant who has been guilty of unreasonable delay, the view I am prepared to follow in the absence of binding authority is that the period for which the interest award is made can properly be adjusted if to allow interest for the whole period for which it could otherwise be ordered would work an injustice to the respondent in the circumstances ... Such would seem to be consistent with the policy of the [sic] s 51A(1) in that an applicant that has been held out of the benefit of its money because of its own unreasonable actions should not be allowed as of course to cast the effects of a 'self-inflicted burden' onto the respondent ...

There was no dispute about the monies owing. Young J held that the Court had no jurisdiction to grant approval under s 477(2A) because what was proposed was not a compromise of a debt, and that the proper course, if the liquidator wanted to pursue the matter, would be for him to seek directions under s 479(3).

Doyle CJ (with whom Duggan and Nyland JJ agreed) said at 158 that: ...reg 5.6.24(3) refers to a creditor who has voted in respect of his or her whole debt or claim...When a vote is taken on the voices or by a show of hands each creditor who votes does so simply in the capacity of a creditor. The Chief Justice went on to say that in his opinion: ...it cannot be said that a creditor who votes on the voices (or by a show of hands) votes in respect of the value of the debt or claim. 20 It is plain on the evidence before me that this is what occurred in the present case. It follows from what Doyle CJ said that the provisions of reg 5.6.24(3) were not enlivened. This regulation contains a statement of one situation in which a secured creditor is deemed to have surrendered his or her security. However, as I have said, that provision is not enlivened in the present case and it is unnecessary to further consider this issue. 22 Doyle CJ in Health &amp; Life Care went on at 162 to explain the relationship between reg 5.6.24 and the provisions of s 554E of the Act. It is evident that even if the provisions of the regulations are not applicable, there may nonetheless amount to conduct on the part of a secured creditor which would constitute an election within the principles stated in Sargent v ASL ."

Case22809,cited,TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175,"The appellants say that they use the term 'no evidence' in the 'strict sense' of an error of law on the part of the Tribunal in reaching a conclusion unsupported by any evidence before the Tribunal rather than as an impermissible attempt to challenge a finding of fact on an appeal concerned only with questions of law ( TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175). The appellants say, 'where is the evidence upon which the Tribunal could conclude as a reasonable prediction of events, absent the scheme, that Mr and Mrs McCutcheon would have been likely to receive an equal distribution of the income stream of $3,232,813.00?' The appellants say the evidence of historical distributions by the trustee of the P &amp; A Trust is entirely inconsistent with such a hypothesis. The Tribunal reached these conclusions. At [145], the Tribunal agreed, 'with the reasons and submissions advanced by [the Commissioner] in connection with the quantification of the tax benefit in the case of each of Mr and Mrs McCutcheon for reasons which will be explained next'. At [146], the Tribunal said this: 146. The Tribunal is of the opinion that while the scheme was entered into for the purpose of obtaining a tax benefit in the case of both Applicants (the non-inclusion of assessable income within section 177C(1)(a)), nevertheless it is not correct to say, as the respondent contended that the full amount of the non-included assessable income would have been shared equally by the applicants. 43 The Tribunal noted that the previous distribution history concerning the P &amp; A Trust indicated that there were persons apart from the appellants who had received distributions. The Tribunal concluded that there was no evidence before it upon which it could act in order to determine what distributions the appellants might have caused the trustee to make, had the scheme not been entered into or carried out. The appellants contended before the Tribunal that evidence of historical distributions provided a basis on which the Tribunal could conclude that distributions would not have been made consistent with the hypothesis. The Tribunal examined the history of distributions and was unpersuaded that those distributions provided support for the appellants' contentions."

Case19995,cited,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Ltd (1988) 12 NSWLR 643,"In the determination of the issues of construction arising on the appeal, being issues on Lindsay's case related to the operation at least ultimately of Item 36 headed Subcontractors , it was submitted by Lindsay that a broad and beneficial approach is appropriate. I was referred in that regard to the Full Court decision in Commissioner of Taxation v Reynolds Australia Alumina Ltd and others (1986) 18 FCR 29, where Burchett J observed generally at 46, in relation to the then Item 14 and the then definition of aids to manufacture of the precursor to the present STEC Act, that 'the beneficial purpose of the legislation with which this appeal is concerned is as apparent as was that of Div 10 in the cases to which I have referred '. That case involved the exemption or otherwise of sales tax in relation to a conveyor in operation from a mine to a refinery, and in particular whether (to cite the description of Beaumont J at 35) that conveyor should be seen as 'something ancillary to the activities at the mine site and therefore part of the mining operations...'. In that latter regard his Honour expressed the need for appraisal of the character of a conveyor by the adoption of a broad perspective. Earlier in relation to an issue involving modifications appearing in the Third Schedule to that precursor legislation, Olney J (sitting as a single justice) in Commissioner of Taxation v Sherwood Overseas Pty Ltd (1985) 75 FLR 474 at 479 spoke of the need for 'a robust approach... to be taken to the construction of the Third Schedule, particularly in view of the fact that it is part of a statute imposing taxation... '. That latter dictum was subsequently cited with approval by Hope JA in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Ltd (1988) 12 NSWLR 643 at 654, in a context also of sales tax, and where his Honour observed that '[s]ales tax legislation is not intended to stultify trade and commerce but is intended to produce revenue for the government from trade or commerce'. More recently in Dick Smith Electronics Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 97 ATC 5089 at 5094, Carr J (with whose reasons Foster and Tamberlin JJ agreed) endorsed what he termed the need for a 'somewhat robust approach to the problem [as] appropriate in sales tax cases' , and Tamberlin J (at 5096) added that 'a presumption... should be given [to] the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances'. In that latter regard, his Honour referred to the High Court's decision in Downland Publications Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1983) 57 ALJR 286, where at 288, Gibbs CJ (with the concurrence of the other four members of the High Court) spoke of the need, in the context of construing an Item of the then sales tax legislation, '... to look at its form, its contents and its use', and endorsed earlier dictum of Stephen J Rotary Offset Press Pty Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1972) 46 ALJR 609 that 'the test properly is one of popular usage and... that the matter is entirely a question of fact to be decided upon an inspection of the document guided by common knowledge'. The Full Court decision in Dick Smith related incidentally to the present sales tax exemption legislation."
Case5203,referred to,Burger King Corporation v Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 187 ,"Although no implied duty to negotiate in good faith was pleaded or relied on, it is convenient to consider the issue for such light that it sheds upon the express duty that was both pleaded and relied on. There has been a recent willingness of Australia Courts to find that a duty of ' good faith ' in negotiations is an implied or incidental term of every commercial contract unless the duty is either excluded expressly or by necessary implication: Pacific Brands Sport &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 288 at [64] ; Vodafone Pacific Ltd v Mobile Innovations Ltd [2004] NSWCA 15 ; Burger King Corporation v Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 187 ; Garry Rogers Motors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Subaru (Aust) Pty Ltd (1999) 21 ATPR 41-703; Alcatel Australia Pty Ltd v Scarcella (1998) 44 NSWLR 349; Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (1997) 76 FCR 151 and Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works (1992) 26 NSWLR 234 . 143 As a result, some academics and judges have resorted to ascertaining the scope of ' good faith ' by focusing on the negative or the exclusions - what constitutes ' bad faith '. This has been described as the ' excluder ' definition on the basis that the good faith requirement cannot actually be satisfied in positive terms: See Summers RS, ""'Good Faith' in General Contract Law and the Sales Provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code"" (1968) 54 Va L Rev 195; Renard Constructions at 266; Burger King at [150]; and Pacific Brands Sport &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 288 at [64] - [65] . 184 In Australia, part of the impetus for the recognition of a implied duty to act in good faith has been the desirability and practice of courts in controlling reliance on general rescission clauses so as to prevent their use "" for improper and extraneous purposes "": see Godfrey Constructions Pty Ltd v Kanangra Park Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 36 ; (1972) 128 CLR 529 at 548; Pierce Bell Sales Pty Ltd v Frazer [1973] HCA 13 ; (1973) 130 CLR 575 at 587 (per Barwick CJ); and Burger King at [151]. In light of these matters and of the foregoing analysis, the issue is whether the conduct of BreakFree, in the course of negotiations and ultimately relying on its power to terminate the HofA under cl 2.2.2, judged objectively, demonstrated a lack of good faith."
Case7089,cited,Bradley v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1989] 1 All ER 961,"The main issue that was argued before me was whether, within the meaning of O 15A r 6, there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have the right to obtain relief from KPMG. On this question, some preliminary observations can be made: &#8226; It is necessary to examine the various elements of the potential cause of action that is sought to be relied upon to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that each of the necessary elements exist. That task requires the Court to conclude at least that there is a reasonable cause to believe that each of the elements of the relevant cause of action might be established. The test is an objective one, and it is not necessary to prove that each of the elements do in fact exist. The rule contemplates that there be reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have a right to obtain relief: see Austrac Operations Pty Ltd v New South Wales [2003] ATPR 41-960 at [11] and Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Page Kirkland Management Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 288 at [5] . &#8226; If the cause of action on which an application for preliminary discovery is based could not succeed, is bound to fail, is ill-founded or is doomed to fail, then discovery ought not be ordered: Bradley v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1989] 1 All ER 961 at 963 to 964; Harris v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Health Authority [1989] 2 All ER 273 at 277. If the potential cause of action would not survive an application for summary judgment pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ('Federal Court Act'), then discovery ought not to be ordered. &#8226; ""Belief"" under O 15A r 6 requires more than mere assertion, a ""hunch"", conjecture or suspicion. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition: see: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 at [13] to [14]; St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 154. &#8226; The availability of preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6 depends upon the evidence before the Court. . The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter of fact in question: see Austrac Operations [2003] ATPR at [37]; John Holland Services [2004] FCA at [13] to [14], [17] and [73] and St George v Rabo 211 ALR at 154. &#8226; The rule is one which should be construed beneficially. In Paxus Services Ltd v People Bank Pty Ltd (1990) 99 ALR 728 at 733 Burchett J said: It is no answer to the applicant's application under r 6 to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a fishing expedition: cf Meth v Norbert Steinhardt &amp; Son Ltd (1959) 33 ALJR 78 at 81. Rule 6 is designed to enable an applicant, in a situation where his proof can rise no higher than the level the rule describes, to ascertain whether he has a case against the prospective respondent -- that is, to ""fish"" in the old sense... It would be unfortunate if a rule designed to amplify the court's power to penetrate obscurities and uncertainties in the interests of justice were to be weakened by restrictive and unnecessary glosses. I think the rule is of a beneficial kind within the meaning of the well known principle of interpretation, and should be given the fullest scope its language will reasonably allow. The proper brake on any excesses in its use is the discretion of the court, which is required to be exercised in the particular circumstances of each case.

Case1252,applied,Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425,"In relation to this ground, I was referred to what was said by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [28] as to the proper test to be applied for apprehended bias in the case of administrative proceedings held in private. To fully appreciate what their Honours there said, one needs to refer also to the surrounding context of [27] [31] inclusive: ' [27] The test for apprehended bias in relation to curial proceedings is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. That formulation owes much to the fact that court proceedings are held in public. There is some incongruity in formulating a test in terms of ""a fair-minded lay observer"" when, as is the case with the tribunal, proceedings are held in private. [28] Perhaps it would be better, in the case of administrative proceedings held in private, to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair-minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias. Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation, there is, in our view, no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility, as distinct from probability, as to what will be done or what might have been done. To do otherwise, would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof. [29] Though the test in administrative proceedings, as in curial proceedings, is, in our view, one of objective possibility, the non-curial nature of the body or tribunal in question and the different character of the proceedings must, as already indicated, be taken into account. In the present case, a significant difference between curial proceedings and the proceedings of the tribunal is that the former are adversarial and the parties are usually legally represented, whereas the latter are inquisitorial in nature and the parties are not represented. [30] Where, as in the present case, credibility is in issue, the person conducting inquisitorial proceedings will necessarily have to test the evidence presented -- often vigorously. Moreover, the need to ensure that the person who will be affected by the decision is accorded procedural fairness will often require that he or she be plainly confronted with matters which bear adversely on his or her credit or which bring his or her account into question. Similar questions by a judge in curial proceedings in which the parties are legally represented may more readily give rise to an apprehension of bias than in the case of inquisitorial proceedings. [31] Where, however, parties are not legally represented in inquisitorial proceedings, care must be taken to ensure that vigorous testing of the evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses do not result in the person whose evidence is in question being overborne or intimidated. If that should happen, a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person might readily infer that there is no evidence that the witness can give which can change the decision-maker's view. 29 There is no submission on behalf of Dr Mathews in relation to this ground of apprehended bias that he was overborne or intimidated by vigorous testing of his evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses at the hearing before the Committee such as to lead a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person to infer that there is no evidence he could give which could change the Committee's view. The only basis of this ground is put in terms of [27] supra. 30 It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that Dr Mathews' contention that the Committee ought to have had regard to unspecified 'further evidence' allegedly incorporated in his submissions on the Draft Report should be rejected. It was submitted that while Dr Mathews was entitled to make '... written submissions suggesting changes to the Draft Report ...', he was not entitled to give evidence see subs 106KD(3) of the Act."
Case8515,followed,Gerhardy v Brown [1985] HCA 11 ; (1985) 159 CLR 70,"Shaw also contended that s 47 of the NTNER Act should be read as requiring procedural fairness to be given to the residents, including Ms Shaw, before a decision is made because s 132(1) declares the provisions of the NTNER Act and actions taken under it for the purposes of those provisions as ""special measures"" for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). As explained in Gerhardy v Brown (1985) 159 CLR 70, s 8(1) of that Act has the consequence that other provisions of that Act (in particular, those that prohibit racial discrimination in various forms) do not apply to ""special measures"" as described in Art 1 paragraph 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (defined in s 3 of that Act). Relevantly, special measures are ones ""taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups ... as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups ... equal enjoyment"" of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It was argued that Indigenous wishes about their lands and their participation in such decision-making as may occur under s 47 is of great importance, and so s 132 supports the preservation of procedural fairness when such a decision is to be made. I do not think that s 132 supports the contention in that way. It is a legislative confirmation that the NTNER Act, in its terms as properly construed, and acts which it authorises, will not breach the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) because what is authorised by and under the NTNER Act are ""special measures"". In other words, I consider s 132 is a legislative declaration that the NTNER Act, and the conduct it authorises, has each of the characteristics described by Brennan J in Gerhardy v Brown 159 CLR at 133. In respect of the town camps, that view is also evidenced also from the Second Reading Speech of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007 (Hansard, House of Representatives, 7 August 2007, pages 26-7). Further, and more fundamentally, s 132(2) of the NTNER Act specifically excludes the operation of Part II of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). Section 132(2) provides: The provisions of this Act, and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions, are excluded from the operation of Part II of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). In my view, the combination of s 132(1) and (2) evinces a clear intention on the part of the legislature to ensure that the NTNER Act and acts done in accordance with that Act, do not contravene the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). Did the Minister give procedural fairness to the residents in the circumstances? My conclusion on the first issue means that it is not necessary to determine this issue. However, as the evidence on this aspect of the case was quite extensive, it is appropriate at least to record my findings on what the Minister and her officers did do in relation to Ms Shaw and the residents and to express my views about it."
Case5638,cited,"Rudge v Bowman , Law Rep 3 Q.B. 689","As between the parties to a transfer and as regards the liability of one to the other, (that is, the inter-parties position) the transaction is not affected by [the section] ( Rudge v Bowman , Law Rep 3 Q.B. 689). The transfer is void 'so far as regards any effect to be given to it by the company ' ( In Re Onward v Building Society (1891) 2 Q.B. 463 per Lord Esher at p 475). The parties might choose to make a contract and it 'may be good as between themselves, though if either of them desires that any effect should be given to it by the company, the Act does apply' ( Onward Building Society , per Lord Esher at p 475). When the question is one of transfer of the shares after the commencement of the winding up, the question is 'would it be beneficial to the company' ( Onward Building Society per Bowan LJ at p 481) and would it 'benefit the creditors' ( Onward Building Society per Bowan LJ at p 482). The general scheme of the provision is that 'as the tree falls so it must lie, unless the Court chooses to alter the existing state of things' ( Onward Building Society per Bowan LJ at p 482). The Court will do so if it 'would be of some benefit to the company or those interested in its assets, and that it (the Court) would not so exercise its discretion unless for very strong reasons' ( Onward Building Society per Kay LJ at p 483). Although Kay LJ makes reference to a demonstrated benefit to 'those interested in [the company's] assets', it seems clear that the reference is not one to the interest of an investor/shareholder. Kay LJ clearly had in mind a reference to the creditors of the company when using that phrase ( Onward Building Society per Kay LJ at p 484). In that particular case, no benefit arose out of the proposed transfer of shares to a buyer in favour of either the company or its creditors as a result of which the Court refused to exercise the discretion to avoid the transfer being rendered void."
Case11189,applied,Bassett v French 64 NY St Rep 292 (1895),"The principle I intend to apply is that if a plaintiff earns any money which he is not able to collect, he is not to be charged with that money. I have not been able to find any Anglo-Australian authority on point but I did come across a decision of the New York Court of Common Pleas that is in point. The case is Bassett v French 64 NY St Rep 292 (1895). The action was for damages for wrongful dismissal. As regards the assessment of damages Pryor J said of the plaintiff: ""He was bound only to reasonable diligence in quest of other employment, and the proof is that he fulfilled the obligation. Having credited the defendant with every dollar he actually received, he is not responsible for money he earned but could not collect."" [citations omitted] 31 Although consultancy fees were credited to Mr Hem's account in the books of SSSA, the fees were not paid, the company is no longer in business, and it is unlikely to have assets to discharge the debt. At least Mr Cant, on whom the onus falls, has not shown otherwise. Thus, there will therefore be no deduction from the claim. 32 The appeal will be allowed and Mr Cant will be directed to admit Mr Hem's proof for $75,000. On the question of costs, I think that Mr Hem should have them on a solicitor and client basis save for the costs incurred on 3 October 2006. Not only was Mr Hem successful on the appeal, on the evidence available to Mr Cant he had no basis for rejecting the proof. I have excluded the costs of 3 October 2006 because they were incurred when Mr Hem applied for and was granted leave to reopen his case and tender additional evidence.

Case19731,cited,Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118,"Generally as to the setting aside of findings of fact that rest on credibility findings by the trial judge, the position is as summarised by McHugh J in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [65] - [67] : 65 Whether an appellate court should intervene in a decision of a trial judge who has made findings based on the credibility or demeanour of a witness is governed by the principles stated in Abalos v Australian Postal Commission. In that case, I said [at 178-9]: [W]here a trial judge has made a finding of fact contrary to the evidence of a witness but has made no reference to that evidence, an appellate court cannot act on that evidence to reverse the finding unless it is satisfied ""that any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses, could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge's conclusion"" [ Watt (or Thomas) v Thomas [1947] AC 484 at 488]. ... [W]hen a trial judge resolves a conflict of evidence between witnesses, the subtle influence of demeanour on his or her determination cannot be overlooked. 66 Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, the other members of the Court, agreed with my judgment. Abalos was applied in Devries v Australian National Railways Commission [1993] HCA 78 ; [(1993) 177 CLR 472 at 479] where Brennan and Gaudron JJ and I said: More than once in recent years, this Court has pointed out that a finding of fact by a trial judge, based on the credibility of a witness, is not to be set aside because an appellate court thinks that the probabilities of the case are against -- even strongly against -- that finding of fact. (Footnote omitted.) If the trial judge's finding depends to any substantial degree on the credibility of the witness, the finding must stand unless it can be shown that the trial judge ""has failed to use or has palpably misused his advantage"" [ SS Hontestroom v SS Sagaporack [1927] AC 37 at 47] or has acted on evidence which was ""inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence"" or which was ""glaringly improbable"" [ Brunskill [1985] HCA 61 ; (1985) 59 ALJR 842 at 844; 62 ALR 53 at 57]. 67 There was nothing novel about these statements. They derived from principles in decisions of this Court and the House of Lords stretching over the best part of a century. 103 In the present case the appellants' attack on the credibility findings in respect of Ms Wills does not come near that standard of appellate review. 104 The ""concentration camp"" comment . It may be that Mr Hibberd was attempting to make the point that if different employees were working on different conditions he would have to ensure that people on the Award did not get such additional benefits as the AWA provided. However, the tone and context in which the term was used were very much matters for his Honour, who had the opportunity to assess the witnesses, and in particular Ms Wills. 105 The appellants say that his Honour failed to deal with submissions made as to fact and law; ""little or no reference"" was made to submissions by the appellants on the evidence. 106 The Federal Magistrates Court was established by the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth). One of the objects of that Act was ""to enable the Federal Magistrates Court to operate as informally as possible in the exercise of judicial power"": s 3(2)(a). Likewise s 42 provides: In proceedings before it, the Federal Magistrates Court must proceed without undue formality and must endeavour to ensure that the proceedings are not protracted. 107 His Honour's judgment, handed down expeditiously some six weeks after final submissions, extends over 51 pages. It deals in detail with the events at the Tavern in 2006. It makes clear findings of fact. It cites the appropriate legislation and authorities. It explains the reasoning which led to his Honour's decision. The appellants on reading the judgment would understand why they lost. Perhaps his Honour did not record and deal with every argument advanced on behalf of the appellants, but he was not obliged to do so."

Dowsett J, the other member of the Full Court, did not need to expressly address the issue."
Case3566,followed,Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178,"Caboolture Park [1993] FCA 471 ; (1993) 45 FCR 224 the respondent to those proceedings obtained judgment against the applicant including an order for costs, which judgment was entered. The applicant subsequently went into liquidation and the respondent sought a supplemental costs order against the applicant's solicitors which would have had the effect of making them liable for those costs. The solicitors submitted that, once the proceedings had been concluded by judgment being entered and by an order for costs being made inter partes , there was no jurisdiction thereafter for the Court to reopen the case. The solicitors also submitted that the jurisdiction contained in s 43 of the Federal Court Act to ""award costs in all proceedings"" was spent once there was no longer a ""proceeding"" before the Court. Applying Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 , the Full Court held that s 43 conferred jurisdiction to award costs against non-parties to a proceeding (at 229). In relation to the submission of the solicitors concerning whether there was still a ""proceeding"" before the Court, the Full Court observed that the submission incorrectly confined the meaning of the word ""proceeding"" to the original action, and was inconsistent with the definition of ""proceeding"" in s 4 of the Federal Court Act (at 230). The Court continued: What s43 requires is that the jurisdiction to order costs be one limited to costs relating to a proceeding. In other words, there is no jurisdiction to order costs at large. There has to be or have been, within the Court's jurisdiction, instituted a proceeding. It is irrelevant, subject to the application of common law principles discussed later, that judgment has been given and entered . (emphasis added) Although as a general rule costs are not awarded against a stranger to litigation, as I have already indicated it is well-settled that the Court has a discretion pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court Act to order costs against a non-party in appropriate circumstances ( Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 , Caboolture Park [1993] FCA 471 ; (1993) 45 FCR 224 , Gore v Justice Corp Pty Ltd (2002) 119 FCR 429, Kebaro Pty Ltd v Saunders [2003] FCAFC 5 , Life Therapeutics Ltd v Bell IXL Investments Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 158 ; (2008) 170 FCR 595). The exercise of such discretion is approached with caution indeed it has been described as ""rare and exceptional"" ( Vestris v Cashman (1998) 72 SASR 449 at 467, Kebaro [2003] FCAFC 5 at [103] ) and depends on the circumstances of each case as it is a ""fact-specific jurisdiction"" ( Kebaro [2003] FCAFC 5 at [69] ). Principles guiding the approach of the Court to the exercise of the include the following: In this case the applicants submitted that the circumstances articulated by Mason CJ and Deane J in Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 must be present before the Court should exercise its discretion to make a costs order against a non-party, namely as follows at 192: For our part, we consider it appropriate to recognize a general category of case in which an order for costs should be made against a non-party and which would encompass the case of a receiver of a company who is not a party to the litigation. That category of case consists of circumstances where the party to the litigation is an insolvent person or man of straw, where the non-party has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and where the non-party, or some person on whose behalf he or she is acting or by whom he or she has been appointed, has an interest in the subject of the litigation. Where the circumstances of a case fall within that category, an order for costs should be made against the non-party if the interests of justice require that it be made. It cannot be correct that the circumstances described in Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 constitute necessary pre-conditions to the exercise of the Court's discretion to award non-party costs pursuant to s 43 as submitted by the applicants. While obviously the comments of Mason CJ and Deane J would be an appropriate guide to the exercise of discretion in an appropriate case, they were clearly obiter (see observations of the Full Court in Yates v Boland [2000] FCA 1895). As the exercise of the discretion in s 43 is unfettered, other than the requirement that it be exercised judicially ( Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 at [192] ; Gore (2002) 119 FCR 429 at 447-448), it follows that the comments in Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 could not prescribe prerequisites to the exercise of discretion to award costs against a non-party. Inevitably, as the Full Court pointed out in Gore (2002) 119 FCR 429 at 437: ...there is no reason to suppose that the remarks of the members of the High Court in Knight have closed the door to the categories of third parties who may be made liable for the costs of litigation nor that the circumstances that were identified by their Honours were exhaustive. ... and later ...the learned trial judge erred when he regarded the passage in Knight as laying down three principles, each of which must be present before a stranger to the litigation could be made liable for costs. (at 451) I consider that it is appropriate to consider any potential liability of Mrs Tracy in terms of principles arising from cases where the courts have considered the exercise of the discretion to award costs against a non-party. The principles articulated in Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 are relevant as guiding factors only, in appropriate circumstances. Consideration It is common ground that the causes of action determined in the primary proceedings were purportedly assigned by the applicants to Mrs Tracy on 17 June 2005 and then from Mrs Tracy to Janling Pty Ltd on 4 July 2005. (It is not in contention that at all material times the sole shareholder of Janling Pty Ltd was a corporation the sole shareholder of which in turn was Mrs Tracy, and that Mrs Tracy herself was the sole director of Janling Pty Ltd.) I say ""purportedly"" because the first and second respondent filed a notice of motion on 8 December 2005 seeking orders that the proceedings be dismissed and/or struck out on the basis that, inter alia , the causes of action the subject of the primary proceedings were not assignable (TS 14 December 2005 p 2 ll 35-43). Whether the assignment of the causes of action was valid ceased to be contentious when the parties agreed, and the Court ordered by consent on 15 February 2006, that the strike out motion of the first and second respondents be dismissed, that Janling Pty Ltd be removed as the applicant to the primary proceedings, and that the first, second and third applicants be substituted as applicants. However notwithstanding the orders of 15 February 2006 there is no evidence that the benefit of the relevant causes of action was reassigned by Janling Pty Ltd to the applicants. Accordingly any purported assignment of the causes of action, to the extent that the assignment took effect, remained with Janling Pty Ltd. It followed that presumably financial benefits of any success of the applicants in the proceedings would flow to Janling Pty Ltd, and thence to Mrs Tracy. The fact that the applicants were unsuccessful with respect to their claims against the first and second respondents (other than with respect to a number of reserved costs) is irrelevant in the context of this notice of motion. However in my view, notwithstanding potential financial benefits accruing to Mrs Tracy from the proceedings, the circumstances of this case do not warrant the exercise of the Court's discretion to award costs against Mrs Tracy pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court Act. As I have already observed, the mere fact that a person may benefit from litigation will not, without more, suffice to justify an award of costs. I form this view for the following reasons."
Case5359,applied,Lam v Ausintel Investments Australia Pty Ltd (1989) 97 FLR 458,"The contravening conduct of the Respondents may have caused loss or damage if that conduct was an inducement to the decision to purchase the SLP 1100: Lam v Ausintel Investments Australia Pty Ltd (1989) 97 FLR 458 at 477 8 per Gleeson CJ (Samuels AJA and Meagher JA agreeing). The "" causative threshold "" remains a matter of judgment: Ricochet Pty Ltd v Equity Trustees Executors and Agency Co Ltd [1993] FCA 99 ; (1993) 41 FCR 229 at 235. Lockhart, Gummow and French JJ there observed (at 235): A finding that a misrepresentation might have induced a decision will not of itself establish as a matter of probability that it did. Consistently with that finding, it may be that, on the balance of probabilities, a party was induced to make a decision by a combination of factors including the misrepresentation. Assuming a non-trivial contribution to the causative process by the misrepresentation, then it may be actionable. Ultimately, the ""causative threshold"" beyond which liability attaches to a misrepresentation which is one of a number of factors inducing a decision that produces loss, will be a question of judgment. This is a familiar process adverted to in various related contexts by Mason CJ in March v E &amp; M H Stramare Pty Ltd (supra) and in this Court in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [1987] FCA 230 ; (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 418 419 and Pavich v Bobra Nominees Pty Ltd [1988] ATPR 49 ,849. (See also Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio (1988) 84 ALR 700 at 712). But the mere possibility that a misrepresentation might have induced a course of action by the representee can never of itself attach liability under s 82 to the making of it."
Case15790,cited,Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389,"In Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 396-397, the High Court expressed reservations about the supposed distinction between the ordinary meaning of words, which is said to raise a question of fact, and the construction and effect of a term or provision which is said to raise a question of law. The Court said: ""With respect this distinction seems artificial, if not illusory. The meaning attributed to individual words in a phrase ultimately dictates the effect or construction that one gives to the phrase when taken as a whole and the approach that one adopts in determining the meaning of the individual words of that phrase is bound up in the syntactical construction of the phrase in question. In R v Brown, a recent House of Lords decision, Lord Hoffmann said: 'The fallacy in the Crown's argument is, I think, one common among lawyers, namely to treat the words of an English sentence as building blocks whose meaning cannot be affected by the rest of the sentence ... This is not the way language works. The unit of communication by means of language is the sentence and not the parts of which it is composed. The significance of individual words is affected by other words and the syntax of the whole.' If the notions of meaning and construction are interdependent, as we think they are, then it is difficult to see how meaning is a question of fact while construction is a question of law without insisting on some qualification concerning construction that is currently absent from the law."" However, the Court did not find it necessary to resolve this issue. 27 Subsequently, the issue was discussed at some length by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v Comptroller-General of Customs (1997) 72 FCR 467 ("" Baxter Healthcare "") in a most helpful judgment. His Honour said at 471-472: ""A preliminary point should be mentioned, since it is important, although little attention was paid to it in argument. Where there is a question whether something falls within a verbal description in a statute (as in a case raising the application of a tariff item), the answer may depend simply on findings of fact as to the meaning of the words constituting the description and as to the nature of the thing itself. With regard to the words, '[t]he question what is the meaning of an ordinary English word or phrase as used in [a] Statute is one of fact not of law': Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126 at 137 per Jordan CJ. Nevertheless, once the nature of the thing has been found as a fact, whether it falls within the verbal description will, in many cases, be a question of law. For, in the first place, it may not be a matter of applying merely the ordinary English meaning of words or phrases, but of applying a meaning derived from the statute by a process of construction, which is a process of law: Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 10 per Mason J, with whose reasons Gibbs, Stephen and Aickin JJ stated their agreement. The principle that construction is a process of law has never been doubted, although the completeness of the proposition derived from it that '[t]he effect or construction of a term once its meaning or interpretation is established is a matter of law': Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs (1994) 124 ALR 645 at 648 per Gummow J; Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (at 287), and the relationship between that proposition and the proposition that the meaning of an ordinary word or phrase is a matter of fact, were left in some doubt when Agfa-Gevaert v Collector of Customs was reversed on appeal by the High Court: see Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 395-397. Gummow J, in Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs , also held (ibid) that it is a question of law 'whether the facts as found fall within the terms of the law as properly construed; to this there is the qualification that, where the statute uses words according to their ordinary meaning and it is reasonably open to hold that the facts as found fall within those words, the decision as to whether they do so fall generally is a matter of fact'. His Honour added that the limitation 'generally' was required, even in this last case, 'because the law may use a word in an ordinary sense, but there may be a number of ordinary senses and it then is necessary to select that which is appropriate, and because whilst the word may have but one ordinary meaning that is imprecise, the word will take its colour from the context and that will require construction of the law, a lawyer's task. The result in such cases will be more than the matching of a set of facts with plain words'. The proposition that 'whether facts fully found fall within the provisions of a statutory enactment properly construed is a question of law' was stated to be sustained by '[m]any authorities' in the judgment of Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council (at 7). The same proposition was subsequently applied by Full Courts of this Court to cases where what was in issue was whether facts as found fell within the provision of a tariff item: Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 ALR 549; Rheem Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1988) 78 ALR 285 at 293, 306."" 30 The second qualification arises where there is uncertainty as to the meaning of a statutory word or expression, and that uncertainty can be resolved by construing the word according to its context. That process raises a question of law. Burchett J explained why this is so in the following passage at 473-474: ""In such a case, a court or tribunal does not choose between different possible applications of the one equivocal or inexact statutory concept (for example, 'insulting') to an evaluation or an appreciation (in the French sense see 69 ALJ 984) of the facts, but chooses upon the principles of construction between possible concepts conveyed by the statutory expression. Of course, it is conceivable that a particular provision in an enactment will raise both kinds of problem. But Gummow J's remarks in Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs seem to me to involve that, where the susceptibility of words and expressions to different meanings or shades of meaning is to be resolved by a process of construction of the statutory language in order to determine whether it embraces the facts found, the ultimate question is one of law. This accords with the view of Fullagar J in Hayes v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) , with Hope at 10, and with the joint judgment of Sheppard and Burchett JJ in Australian National Railways Commission v Collector of Customs (SA) (1985) 8 FCR 264 at 277. In Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd at 397, the joint judgment of the High Court refers to the principle 'that the determination of whether an ""Act uses [an] expression ... in any other sense than that which they have [scilicet, it has] in ordinary speech"" is always a question of law'. On that basis, logically it must also be a question of law, in a case where a statutory expression has several ordinary senses, whether it is used in a particular one of them. And as the joint judgment of Neaves, French and Cooper JJ in Pozzolanic Enterprises points out (at 288-289), uncertainties may require to be resolved by reference to a value judgment about the range of the Act, rather than a matching of the facts to the, or an, ordinary meaning of the words. Their Honours said: 'Although the words of the statute are construed according to their ordinary English meaning, that does not mean that their application to a set of facts is simply described as the matching of that set of facts with a factual description. There is necessarily a selection process involved. The range of relationships to which the words apply for the purpose of the Act depends upon a judgment about that purpose. The selection process involved is analogous to that used in determining what causal relationships between conduct and loss attract liability for the purpose of s 82 of the Trade Practices Act (1974) (Cth): see Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 418-419; Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio (1988) 58 FCR 274 at 286-288; 84 ALR 700 at 712-713. In the end this is not a process of fact finding. The facts are found. What is left is a value judgment about the range of the Act and that is a question of law.' This passage was referred to in the joint judgment of the High Court, without criticism, in Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd at 395."""
Case21735,referred to,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fila Sport Oceania Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2004] FCA 376 (2004); ATPR 41-983,"In this proceeding the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the ACCC') sought various remedies against the second respondent ('Mr Carney') for contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act'). The relief sought included declarations that Mr Carney had knowingly been concerned in contraventions of ss 46 and 47 of the Act and the imposition of pecuniary penalties for contraventions of those provisions. The ACCC alleged that Mr Carney was a person knowingly concerned in contraventions of the Act by the first respondent of which he was, at relevant times, the Managing Director. The proceeding, in so far as it involved the first respondent, was dealt with by Heerey J: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fila Sport Oceania Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2004] FCA 376 ; (2004) ATPR 41-983. The circumstances in which the contraventions by the first respondent occurred (and in which it was alleged Mr Carney was knowingly concerned) are explained in his Honour's reasons at [5] to [19] and need not be repeated here. Suffice to say the contraventions were serious. They related to the marketing of sporting products to supporters of Australian Football League clubs and involved attempts by the first respondent (which were to a significant extent successful) to exclude competitor's products from retail outlets. The ACCC discontinued the proceeding against the third respondent and he gave evidence against Mr Carney. 2 The trial of the proceeding between the ACCC and Mr Carney commenced on 28 August 2006 and was estimated at that time to take three weeks. Mr Carney represented himself and cross-examined each of the witnesses who was called by the ACCC. On 15 September 2006, at the end of the three week period allotted for the trial, only about half of the ACCC's witnesses had given evidence. It was estimated that up to a further five weeks would be necessary to complete the hearing. The further hearing of the proceeding was adjourned until 27 November 2006. Before the trial was adjourned the parties had agreed to the suggestion that the matter be referred for mediation by a Court appointed mediator. When the hearing resumed on 27 November 2006 the parties announced that the mediation had been successful and invited the Court to make a declaration and orders in accordance with agreed minutes. Those minutes read: 'THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 1. Between September or October 1999 and November 2000, the second respondent was a person involved in a contravention by the first respondent of section 47 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 2. The second respondent pay to the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty pursuant to section 76 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) in respect of his conduct referred to in paragraph 1 above, in the amount of $20,000 by four yearly instalments of $5,000 each, the first such instalment payable on or before 30 June 2007, and the second, third and fourth instalments payable on or before 30 June 2008, 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2010 respectively, provided that if the second respondent defaults in any payment and the default continues for one month after written notice of the default, the total outstanding balance shall become immediately due and payable. 3. The applicant and the second respondent bear their own costs of and incidental to the proceeding against the second respondent."
Case16143,cited,Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 24 FCR 313,"The factual premises upon which the opinion is based, being the material in the Brief to Crop Expert, were identified, disclosed and available to all parties, and the subject of evidence which is itself admissible ( Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 24 FCR 313 , and see discussion and cases cited in S Odgers Uniform Evidence Law (7th ed) Lawbook Co 2006). While it is preferable that the factual material upon which the expert relies be annexed to the report in compliance with the Federal Court of Australia Guidelines for Expert Witnesses in Proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia , in the circumstances of this case I do not consider Mr Frick's expert report inadmissible nor its probative value diminished because of the physical absence of the two volumes of material composing the Brief to Crop Expert from the affidavit or the expert report itself. 297 The applicants submitted further that even if Mr Frick's affidavit were admitted as evidence, the affidavit and Mr Frick's expert report were irrelevant and of no assistance to the Court in determining whether the respondents had a reasonable basis for their predictions as to future performance of the orchards. The grounds of objection raised by the applicants related specifically to Mr Frick's responses to questions during cross-examination and were as follows: &#8226; Mr Frick, in compiling his report, did not speak to Mr Burns or any other Sunstate employee (TS 1327 ll 22-27); &#8226; in compiling his report Mr Frick obtained information from ""industry contacts"" (TS 1327 ll 32-45); &#8226; in compiling his report Mr Frick did not visit the orchards because of his work commitments (TS 1331 ll 39-46); &#8226; in compiling his report Mr Frick took no steps to assess the accuracy of that information and simply assumed it was accurate (TS 1333 ll 5-18); &#8226; in compiling his report Mr Frick used ""experienced grower information and information from other consultants"" (TS 1335 ll 36-37); &#8226; Mr Frick refused to disclose the names of the persons from whom he had obtained information used in the preparation of his report (TS 1336 ll 18-47); &#8226; Mr Frick refused to identify the location of the properties from which he obtained data for the purposes of his report (TS 1339 ll 10-42); &#8226; Mr Frick failed to recognise the climatic, geographical and soil differences between the inland Central Burnett Region (upon which he based his assessment of reasonable estimates for the two orchards) and the coastal areas where the two orchards were located (TS 1339-1340). 298 Before turning to consider these objections it is helpful to first identify the factual premises of Mr Frick's expert report. Factual premises of expert report 328 The general rule that hearsay evidence is not admissible, as recognised by s 59 Evidence Act , is relaxed in relation to expert opinions. Traditionally if expert witnesses relied on the existence or non-existence of some fact which was basic to the question on which they were asked their opinion, that fact needed to be proved by admissible evidence (JD Heydon Cross on Evidence (subscription service vol 1) Butterworths para 33825). However this so-called ""basis"" rule was extended at common law to allow knowledge of the expert derived from general experience to legitimately contribute to the opinion arrived at in the expert report. This knowledge derived from general experience could at common law be contrasted with specific information sought by an expert from third parties for comparative purposes as a basis for his or her opinion such information would likely be hearsay unless it were disclosed and admitted, and the resultant opinion therefore inadmissible ( English Exporters (London) Ltd v Eldonwall Ltd (1973) 1 Ch 415 at 421, Arnotts Ltd 24 FCR 313 at 350-351 and ASIC v Rich [2005] NSWCA 152 ; 218 ALR 764 at 800). 348 In my view, although these comments represent a common law position as to admissibility of expert opinion evidence as distinct from the position under the Evidence Act , they are relevant to the consideration by the Court under the Evidence Act as to the probative value of the evidence before it (cf Arnotts Ltd 24 FCR 313 at 350)."
Case14995,cited,Swan Portland Cement Ltd v Minister for Small Business and Customs [1991] FCA 49 ; (1991) 28 FCR 135 at 144,"respondents contended that it was open to the CEO to make the finding in Report 137 that in that context it was likely that there would be price convergence between Siam's imports and Qenos' product. They argued that the test of causation of material injury was ""essentially a practical exercise that had the purpose of achieving an objective of determining whether, viewed as a whole, the relevant Australian industry is suffering material injury from dumping"", relying on what Lockhart J had said in Swan Portland Cement Ltd v Minister for Small Business and Customs [1991] FCA 49 ; (1991) 28 FCR 135 at 144; and Schaefer Waste Technology Sdn Bhd v Chief Executive Officer, Australian Customs Service [2006] FCA 1644 ; (2006) 156 FCR 94 at 115-116 [147] - [149] per Jacobson J. ISSUE TWO Did the respondents misconstrue the application of s 269TAE(2B)? The respondents responded that Report 137 had analysed whether material injury to Qenos was being caused or threatened in a practical manner as contemplated in Swan Portland 28 FCR at 144 and Schaefer 156 FCR at 115-116 [147]-[149]. They argued that the terms of s 269TAE(1) directed the Minister's enquiry to the exportation of goods from ""the country of export"", not to an individual exporter located there and that nothing in s 269TAE(2A) affected this construction. The respondents argued that Report 137 had considered Thai exports as a whole and their impact on the Australian industry in accordance with the requirements of Div 6A of Pt XVB. They contended that they had applied the right test and had used the non-injurious price analysis in Report 134 to arrive at their findings. In Swan Portland 28 FCR at 144-145, Lockhart J examined the nature of a determination whether material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods to those dumped has been, or is being caused, or is threatened. He said that such a determination was not an exercise of counting heads of markets, production or distribution centres or things of that kind and that: ""It is essentially a practical exercise designed to achieve the objective of determining whether, when viewed as a whole, the relevant Australian industry is suffering material injury from the dumping of goods."" And, he went on to emphasise that the finding of injury depends on the facts of the case and inevitably involves a question of degree, balancing all relevant considerations and integers, before concluding whether or not the dumping constitutes material injury to the Australian industry. That approach was approved by Black CJ, Neaves and von Doussa JJ in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Fraser [1992] FCA 120 ; (1992) 34 FCR 564 at 576, 577-578. The Full Court held that if the Australian ind`ustry had suffered detriment from a number of probable causes, then s 269TG required a determination whether there was a separate material injury or material incremental injury caused by the dumping over and above detriment caused by other factors: ICI Australia 34 FCR at 579. While in each of those cases the Court was considering the legislation in an earlier form than that it presently takes, those observations continue to assist in the construction of the present statutory scheme: see e.g. Schaefer 156 FCR at 115-116 [147]-[149] per Jacobson J."
Case22722,considered,"Brock v United States of America [2007] FCAFC 3 , 157 FCR 121","Whether or not either of these two fields of inquiry can be properly characterised as "" jurisdictional facts "" thus need not be resolved.

Less difficulty may be experienced in characterising as a "" jurisdictional fact "" a question as to whether a person has informed a magistrate of his consent; greater difficulty, however, may be experienced in characterising as "" jurisdictional "" whether a magistrate had "" reason to believe that the consent was not given voluntarily"" . The potential inconvenience consequent upon construing s 18 in such a manner may be a telling reason to conclude that such matters are not "" jurisdictional "": cf Brock v United States of America [2007] FCAFC 3 at [30] per Black CJ, [2007] FCAFC 3 ; 157 FCR 121."
Case2182,considered,SSAU Nominees Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1985) 16 ATR 992,"The diversity of opinion in Brookton had previously been commented on by Ormiston J of the Supreme Court of Victoria in SSAU Nominees Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1985) 16 ATR 992 at 1011: 'Here it is clear that all members of the court on each occasion [Brookton and Ruffy] held the view that the primary object or objects of the appellant's business could not be determined solely, or even initially, by reference to its memorandum of association, and that evidence of its history, setting up and activities, had to be examined. In this instance Mason J (at 453), with the concurrence of Wilson J, thought that the intentions, if not the motives, of the promoters could be looked at, although Aickin J strongly disagreed: at 463.' 214 SSAU Nominees involved a claim for a sales tax exemption for 'goods for use ... by a society, institution or organisation established and carried on exclusively or principally for the promotion of the interests of a university or school conducted by an organisation not carried on for the profit of an individual'. Some 17 years later, Mandie J of the Supreme Court of Victoria said in Capital Club Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (2007) 66 ATR 606 at [41]: 'Ormiston J referred to Ruffy and Brookton noting that the High Court held the view that the primary object or objects of the company's business could not be determined solely or even initially by reference to its Memorandum of Association and that evidence of its history, setting up and activities had to be examined. The case otherwise turned on its own facts and the particular legislation.'"
Case15313,referred to,Attorney General (Cth) v Alinta Ltd [2008] HCA 2 ; (2008) 242 ALR 1,"It may well be that the Panel's concern to make quite clear that it was not basing its decision on a finding that there had been a contravention of the Corporations Act was because its decision predated the decision of the High Court in Attorney-General (Cth) v Alinta Ltd [2008] HCA 2 ; (2008) 242 ALR 1. At the time, therefore, the question of whether s 657A(2)(b) involved the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth had not been authoritatively determined. 25 The review Panel rejected CEMEX's submission that the terms of its best and final offer should be construed as retaining for CEMEX a discretion whether or not it would deduct the amount of the dividend paid to Rinker shareholders or that it had qualified its 10 April announcement by reserving such a discretion. It referred to analysts' reports submitted by CEMEX and found that of the seven reports submitted, only one expressed the view that CEMEX could allow Rinker shareholders to retain the benefit of the final dividend, two expressed a contrary view and the others did not address the matter. 26 The review Panel also referred to the statement made by Rinker on 27 April 2007, when it announced the final dividend of $0.25. The Rinker announcement said: Shareholders should note that under the terms of CEMEX's takeover offer for Rinker, CEMEX has the right to deduct the amount of the dividend (or an amount equal to its value, as are reasonably assessed by CEMEX) from the offer price payable to accepting shareholders who have or will receive that dividend. The Panel considered that the ""ordinary reading of the statement"" would merely remind shareholders of the terms of CEMEX's offer and would not convey the meaning that CEMEX might improve its offer, by allowing them to retain a dividend. 38 The regulatory framework which Chapter 6 establishes is, as Gleeson CJ observed in Attorney General (Cth) v Alinta Ltd at 4, designed ""to preserve an efficient, competitive and informed capital market"". Section 657A(1) recognises that the conduct of a takeover may be inconsistent with such a market even where it does not contravene a specific provision of the Corporations Act . Emmett J recognised this in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel [2006] FCA 274 ; (2006) 151 FCR 77 at 108: The panel, of course, is expressly empowered by s 657A(1) to make declarations notwithstanding that there has been no contravention of the Act. Part 6.10 of the Act provides flexibility in the regulation of the acquisition of shares in circumstances where the literal operation of the regulatory regime is either unnecessarily restrictive or ineffective to achieve the object of Ch 6. It is clear enough that the regime involving the panel is designed to ensure regulation of the acquisition of shares over and above the provisions contained in the balance of Ch 6: ... The panel made its declaration because, notwithstanding compliance by Glencore and the Banks with the disclosure regime prescribed by the Act, the purposes of Ch 6, as expressed in s 602 , were not achieved. That is precisely the circumstance for which s 657A provides. It is not unreasonable for the panel, if its decision was otherwise lawful and authorised, to reach that conclusion."

Case5976,discussed,"Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166 ; (2004) 136 FCR 134 ","Counsel for the Secretary submitted that ""a beneficial interest"" would exist for the purposes of par 1207V(2)(d) where there was ""the entitlement ... to enforce the due administration of the trust, and ... the capacity to receive property or interest"". On this submission, the position at general law was very largely immaterial. Relying on Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166 ; (2004) 136 FCR 134 ("" Geeves "") and Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 368 and 381, the Secretary argued that a broad construction of par 1207V(2)(d) was consistent with the purpose of Pt 3.18, which was to capture the kind of arrangements made by the testamentary trust in question here. The Secretary maintained that par 1207V(2)(d) was specifically intended to capture discretionary trust entitlements; and that, if I were to accept the Elliotts' submissions, then par 1207V(2)(d) would not operate to capture discretionary trust beneficiaries as intended. The Secretary emphasised the Elliotts' practical capacity to have access to the income and assets of the trust created under clause 5(b) of the will and that they benefited from regular payments out of trust funds. The Secretary noted that all possible discretionary beneficiaries were necessarily ""associates"" and argued that their interests could be aggregated, with the result that the Elliotts should be considered to pass the control test via par 1207V(2)(d). 40 The authorities provide little direct assistance on the principal question in the case. The Secretary referred to Geeves , which gave rise to the question whether a court-ordered trust fund was to be taken into account in valuing the ""assets"" held by the sole beneficiary for the purpose of the assets test in s 198(1B) of the Social Security Act . Geeves is, plainly enough, a different case from the present. It did not concern a discretionary trust where the entitlement of a beneficiary is unascertained. Geeves related to a private trust with an ascertained beneficiary, who therefore held a proprietary interest in the property subject to the trust. The Full Court upheld the primary judge's decision that the trust was an ""excluded trust"" and therefore its assets could not be attributed for the purposes of the assets test. This finding provides no guidance here. Keifel J, with whom Weinberg J agreed, also held that the beneficiary's interest in the trust assets was not to be regarded as 'property' or 'assets' within the meaning of s 11 of the Social Security Act , because the trust assets could not be utilised by the beneficiary: see Geeves at 141. Keifel J's comments in this regard have some bearing on the present case. Her Honour said (at 141-2): The evident focus of the Act, in my view, is upon assets which are available for a person's use. It does not seem to be consistent with the purpose of the Act to require that assets which are not able to be utilised by a person are to be taken into account in assessing whether they qualify for the benefit in question. ... Even on a wider view of property a discretionary trust would not qualify. It could in no sense be said to be the property of a person who is not yet identified as a beneficiary of it. For the purposes of the Act, however, some beneficiaries of discretionary trusts in reality, if not in law, have access to the trust assets because they are in a position to control the trust. The amendments of 2000 recognise and deal with such a situation. They and the Explanatory Memorandum tend to confirm, in my view, that it is assets which are in truth available to a person which are relevant for the purposes of the Act. ... I would therefore conclude that [the beneficiary's] interest in the trust assets would not be regarded as property or assets within the meaning of s 11 of the Act. The amendments of 2000 have the effect however that they would nevertheless be attributed to him. Whilst not in control in the same sense as persons who control discretionary trusts, he would pass the control test set up by s 1207V(2) because his beneficial interest in the trust fund would be 50% or more. The presumption here is that he does have a measure of control because of the extent of his interests. The Secretary's declaration exempts a court-ordered trust, such as that in question here, from the attribution rules. It puts beyond doubt that they are not to be included in the value of the care receiver's assets. It seems to me that, to the extent that this passage elucidates the present question, it tends against the Secretary's argument. First, it emphasises that the purpose of subs 1207V(2) is to make assets that are in reality available to a person relevant for the purposes of determining pension entitlements and, secondly, it underscores the fact that regard must be had to the question of control, having regard to the particular trust in question. This indicates that it is incorrect to view every discretionary trust in the same light; instead, attention must be paid to the particular terms of each trust, whether fixed or discretionary, and to the criteria to which subs 1207V(2) direct attention. 46 Furthermore, Gartside , Anchorage , Carey and Livingston (see Weinberg J's discussion in Geeves at 143) make it plain that, although the object of a discretionary trust holds a bundle of rights, these rights do not necessarily amount to what can be termed an ""interest"" or ""beneficial interest"", when considered from the perspective of a particular statute: compare M Stone and V Lesnie, ""Some Thoughts on Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Ownership in Revenue Law"" (1996) 19(1) UNSW Law Journal 181 at 183 and David Hayton, Paul Matthews &amp; Charles Mitchell, Underhill and Hayton Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees (LexisNexis Butterworths, 17 th ed, 2006) at [1.1]. Of course, this is not to say that, in a particular statute, such rights might not be so regarded and described. The question, then, is whether or not the rights of the discretionary beneficiaries in this case amount to ""beneficial interests in the corpus or income"" such that they might be ""aggregated"" within the meaning of par 1207V(2)(d)."

In Agnew v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [2001] UKPC 28 ; [2001] 2 AC 710, the Privy Council, on appeal from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, was concerned with the character of a charge over book debts. At 725 their Lordships said: question is not merely one of construction. In deciding whether a charge is a fixed charge or a floating charge, the court is engaged in a two-stage process. At the first stage it must construe the instrument of charge and seek to gather the intentions of the parties from the language they have used. But the object at this stage of the process is not to discover whether the parties intended to create a fixed or a floating charge. It is to ascertain the nature of the rights and obligations which the parties intended to grant each other in respect of the charged assets. Once these have been ascertained, the court can then embark on the second stage of the process, which is one of categorisation. This is a matter of law. It does not depend on the intention of the parties. If their intention, properly gathered from the language of the instrument, is to grant the company rights in respect of the charged assets which are inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge, then the charge cannot be a fixed charge however they may have chosen to describe it.'"

As long as the steps required by the EPBC Act are taken by the Minister, the Australian Government is not prevented from having a policy position on the pulp mill project (see Hot Holdings Pty Limited v Creasy [2002] HCA 51 ; (2002) 210 CLR 438 at [50] ). 148 The critical issue is whether a well-informed reasonable observer would consider there was an apprehension of bias in the Minister. The Minister received strong advice from Mr Early, who firmly believed in the preliminary documentation assessment approach. Gunns lobbied him in favour of that approach. That approach also suited the Tasmanian Government and enhanced the chances of synchronisation of approval under the EPBC Act with approval by the Tasmanian Parliament. By 2 April 2007, the Minister wanted to know if an approval timeline ending in August 2007 was possible because he knew that was what the Tasmanian Government and Gunns were pursuing. However, the Minister did not consider the preliminary documentation assessment approach to the exclusion of all other approaches. Even during the course of making the assessment approach decision, the Minister questioned Mr Early about why another approach was not being recommended. At the time of making his decision, I do not consider that a well-informed observer could reasonably form the view that the Minister was biased towards the preliminary documentation assessment approach to the extent that he was not prepared to even consider alternative approaches, because he plainly did. 149 The allegation that the 2007 assessment approach decision is invalid due to apprehended bias is rejected."

But, s 33H(1)(b) and (c) required that one or more of the application or forms 129 or 167 specified the nature of the claims made by the group members and the questions of law or fact common to them. There was no claim made (as referred to in s 33C(1)(c)) by the group members in any of those documents for an allowance of further time to file an application under s 46PO(2) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act . Nor did any of those documents specify any question of law or fact common to the group members (referred to in s 33H(1)(c)) the subject of the application to allow further time to make the foreshadowed application under s 46PO(1). The Court has an important responsibility of safeguarding the interest of group members as a whole under s 33V(1). There is a danger that when a settlement is reached or a discontinuance is agreed, the interests of the actual parties to the proceedings may receive their paramount consideration while the impact on group members may not be fully or properly addressed. That is why in exercising the power under s 33V(1) to approve a settlement or discontinuance the Court must scrutinise with great care the way in which any order is formulated. In the decided cases the Courts have approached settlements with a keen eye to ensuring that the interests of group members are vouched safe: see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258B-C per Branson J; McMullin v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd (1998) 84 FCR 1 at 3C-E per Wilcox J; Courtney 122 FCR at 181 [45] per Sackville J and Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516 at [64] - [68] per Jacobson J. And, the power in s 33ZF(1) enables the Court to make any order that it thinks appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is done in a proceeding under Pt IVA. Wilcox J described the extent of the power in s 33ZF(1) as being ""the widest possible"" in McMullin 84 FCR at 4C-D. In Courtney 122 FCR at 182-184 [47]-[54] esp at [52] Sackville J examined the scope of the power, and cautioned that s 33ZF(1) should not become a vehicle for rewriting the rest of Pt IVA. This provision, like all provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court, should not be construed narrowly by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in its express words: Owners of the Ship 'Shin Kobe Maru' v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ."

In summary form, the scheme is as follows: The commencement of proceedings is by the issue of a provisional warrant under s 12(1) or by the giving of a notice under s 16(1). Once arrested, the person is required by s 15 to be taken before a magistrate and remanded in custody or on bail for such period as may be necessary for eligibility proceedings to be taken under s 19. Where a person is on remand under s 15 and the Attorney-General has given a notice under s 16(1), provision is made under s 19 for a magistrate to conduct proceedings to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender.

Case11088,applied,Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82,"Section 120A(3) of the VE Act relevantly provides that a hypothesis connecting the death of a person with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person is reasonable only if there is in force a SoP or a determination by the Commission that upholds the hypothesis. The second basis (a determination by the Commission) is not relevant to the circumstances of this case. That is, the hypothesis raised (that is, pointed to) by the material will only be reasonable if the hypothesis is consistent with, or fits the template of, a SoP: see Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 96, endorsing the observations of Heerey J at first instance: Deledio v Repatriation Commission (1997) 47 ALD 261 at 275. 19 The method by which ss 120(1) , 120 (3) and 120A (3) are applied was explained in Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 97-98. The Full Court set out the course which the Tribunal is to take in a case such as the present in the following terms: ""1. The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person. No question of fact finding arises at this stage. If no such hypothesis arises, the application must fail. 2. If the material does raise such a hypothesis, the Tribunal must then ascertain whether there is in force an SoP determined by the Authority under s 196B(2) or (11). If no such SoP is in force, the hypothesis will be taken not to be reasonable and, in consequence, the application must fail. 3. If an SoP is in force, the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one. It will do so if the hypothesis fits, that is to say, is consistent with the 'template' to be found in the SoP. The hypothesis raised before it must thus contain one or more of the factors which the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist, and be related to the person's service (as required by ss 196B(2)(d) and (e)). If the hypothesis does contain these factors, it could neither be said to be contrary to proved or known scientific facts, nor otherwise fanciful. If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template, it will be deemed not to be 'reasonable' and the claim will fail. 4. The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s 120(1) whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war-caused, or in the case of a claim for incapacity, that the incapacity did not arise from a war-caused injury. If not so satisfied, the claim must succeed. If the Tribunal is so satisfied, the claim must fail. It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it. In so doing, no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involved."" 45 In McKenna , the Commission had determined that ischaemic heart disease and atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease suffered by Mr McKenna were each a war-caused disease within the VE Act . The effect of the decision of Goldberg J at first instance was to reach a contrary conclusion. Goldberg J said (28 AAR 7 at 15): ""For the purposes of s 120A(3) of the [VE] Act the hypothesis which has to be upheld by a [SoP] is the hypothesis which connects the disease suffered by a veteran with the circumstances of his service. So stated, the hypothesis has to point to a connection which starts with the disease in respect of which the application is made and ends with the service. That connection will comprise a number of links or factors each of which must be upheld by a [SoP] and, if need be, by more than one [SofP]. In the instant case the relevant links are: [diseases listed] When the hypothesis is identified this way it is then necessary, consistently with the course identified by the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio , to ask and answer the question in accordance with s 120A(3)(a) of the Act is there in force a SoP that upholds the hypothesis, that is to say the hypothesis connecting each of the diseases contracted by the respondent with the circumstances of his operational service? It is therefore necessary to identify whether there is in force a [SoP] which upholds the whole, and not just part, of this hypothesis.."". 46 The Full Court endorsed the approach of Goldberg J and said at [20]: ""Since the Authority had determined [SoP] in respect of the kinds of diseases suffered by Mr McKenna (s 120A(4)(b)), the next step which the Tribunal was required to take was to form an opinion whether the hypotheses pointed to by the material before the Tribunal were reasonable. It was only entitled to form the opinion that they were reasonable if they were upheld by, in the sense of consistent with, the relevant [SoP]. In our view, for either of the hypotheses to be upheld by a [SoP], as required by s 120A(3) of the Act, each of its sub-hypotheses would have to be so upheld . A complex hypothesis (that is, one comprising more than one element or part) can be no stronger than each of its elements or parts."" (Emphasis added.) 47 In the present case, the Tribunal was bound to apply the McKenna principle. It explicitly rejected that approach. That was an error of law. On any view, one of the sub-hypotheses was that the effects of the veteran's ""service related alcohol habit ... [had] impaired his concentration and contributed to the fatal collision"" . As the Tribunal failed to ask the question about the alcohol related sub-hypothesis, it failed to consider whether there was a SoP which upheld that sub-hypothesis. 48 Mr Green SC, counsel for the respondent, contended that even if the Tribunal had applied the McKenna principle to the SoP, it would have reached the same conclusion on the basis that there was no SoP which covered the hypothesis (and one assumes the sub-hypothesis) that the veteran was a heavy drinker. In particular, Mr Green relied upon the following findings of the Tribunal: ""Contrary to submissions of the Respondent, there is evidence of the deceased being drunk on the evening prior to his death and hung over on the following morning... Whilst I am satisfied that on the evening prior to the fatal collision the deceased having regard to the evidence of Mrs Codd had been drinking heavily I am satisfied that he metabolised the alcohol during the period between arriving at home at approximately 10.30pm and the collision at approximately 7.30am. In those circumstances any alcohol residue at the time of the collision would have been so minuscule to safely permit a finding that at the time of the collision the deceased was not under the influence of alcohol."""

Case8861,referred to,"Institut Francais du Petrole des Carburants et Lubricants' Application, Re [1972] FSR 147, [1972] RPC 364 ","The first case in the United Kingdom Court of Appeal to consider selection patents was In the matter of Esso Research and Engineering Co's Application (Shell) [1960] RPC 35 where the principle was explained as follows ([1960] RPC 35 at 53): ""So it is that you may have first the scientist who discovers and discloses the whole range and who may obtain patent protection for the subject-matter of his discovery or the means of manufacturing them what Maugham, J. called the ""originating patent"". But within such a range there is room also for the second scientist whose researches may discover and disclose that certain of the items or a section of them have advantages peculiar to themselves, hitherto unknown; and, if so, then there would appear to be no ground on reason or principle why patent protection should not be, in proper cases, available to the second scientist."" (See also Institut Francais du Petrole des Carburants et Lubricants' Application, Re [1972] FSR 147, [1972] RPC 364; May &amp; Baker Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255.) 81 If that view is correct, then the patent in suit is not a selection patent in the ordinary sense as PCR 4099 and each of the enantiomers were expressly disclosed and claimed in the earlier patents and are expressly referred to in the patent in suit. In one sense, the dextro-rotatory enantiomer is selected from that sub-class. There is authority to suggest that selection can be from a small class (per Buckley LJ in Beecham Group Ltd's (Amoxycillin) Application, Re [1980] RPC 261 at 292; EI Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co (Witsiepe's) Application [1982] FSR 303 per Lord Wilberforce at 310; but, cf Institut Francais du Petrole des Carburants et Lubricants' Application, Re [1972] FSR 147 at 154, [1972] RPC 364). I will therefore assume, contrary to my own opinion, that the principle can apply to the present case on that basis if the requirements are met. 101 It is difficult to see how this patent could have been valid without disclosing the starting point or the master patent in the specification. To do so would have amounted to obtaining the patent on a false suggestion or representation within the meaning of s 100(1)(k) of the 1952 Act or be in breach of s 40(1)(a) of that Act by not describing the invention (see Sami S Svendsen Inc v Independent Products Canada Ltd [1968] HCA 65 ; (1968) 119 CLR 156 at 159 and 164 165). The same applies under the 1990 Act. Hence the necessity to spell out that step and the advantage in the complete specification ( Re IG Farbenindustrie AG's Patents (1930) 47 RPC 289 at 323; Institut Francais du Petrole des Carburants et Lubricants' Application, Re [1972] FSR 147 at 154, [1972] RPC 364). The specification of the patent in suit is drafted consistently with that obligation. The cases on selection patents discuss both novelty and obviousness by reference to the nature of the selection from the earlier patent specification to the later claim."
Case19610,referred to,Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589,"On 16 October 2007 I published reasons for judgment in this matter ( Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589]). On that day I stood the proceeding over to a date to be fixed for the purpose of making orders giving effect to those reasons. Having regard to the complex history of the matter I additionally invited the parties to draw to my attention any issues on which I had inadvertently failed to rule. 2 No agreement was reached between the parties as to the orders appropriate to be made to give effect to my reasons for judgment. Dr Wenkart took the view that my published reasons for judgment did not deal with all of the issues required to be resolved in this matter. 3 The proceeding was therefore relisted to allow the parties to make further submissions. On 12 November 2007 Mr Sheahan SC appeared with Mr Green for Dr Wenkart; Mr Creais, solicitor, appeared for Mr Pantzer and Mr Rea appeared for Hapday Holdings Pty Ltd. These reasons for judgment should be read together with those published on 16 October 2007. 33 Additionally, as I noted in [2007] FCA 1589 at [64] , Mr Pantzer's claim for 85% of the sum of $115,406.07 (ie $98,095.16) has been the subject of litigation in other proceedings. In Wenkart v Pantzer (No 6) [2003] FCA 1210 published on 29 October 2003, Lindgren J dismissed a motion by Dr Wenkart for an extension of time within which to request that this claim be taxed. On that day Mr Pantzer's claim to be lawfully entitled to that sum was rendered effectively beyond challenge. The date upon which he is to be regarded as becoming lawfully entitled to the sum is, in my view, 14 days after Dr Wenkart became aware of the amount of the claim, namely 29 March 2002 (reg 8.09(1) of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 as then in force). This amount is reflected in the second unpaid amount listed in Mr Pantzer's schedule. 57 The accuracy of Mr Pantzer's schedule so far as it concerns payments made to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris is not challenged by Dr Wenkart. Payments by Mr Pantzer to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris in the aggregate amount of $380,225 are evidenced by a list of cash payments (""the Cash Payments List"") made during the period of the administration by Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate provided to Dr Wenkart's then solicitors (Bruce &amp; Stewart) by Mr Pantzer's then solicitors (Sally Nash &amp; Co) under cover of a letter dated 7 October 2004 and placed in evidence by Dr Wenkart. At the heart of the dispute between Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer concerning the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris is the question of whether all of the bills of costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris are required to be taxed to determine the total quantum of the costs that Mr Pantzer is entitled to recover from Dr Wenkart (see order 1 of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002 which are reproduced in [2007] FCA 1589 at [15] ). 58 Mr Pantzer's case is that there was no request for any of the amounts paid to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris to be taxed under s 167 of the Act other than the amount of $105,000 paid on the date that Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy was annulled. Robert Gorczyca of Bruce &amp; Stewart, as the firm was then known, gave evidence that the first occasion on which he was provided with an accounting of the former bankrupt estate of Dr Wenkart was when he received the Cash Payments List (see [57] above). Before being retained by Dr Wenkart, Bruce &amp; Stewart acted for creditors of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate. The evidence suggests that the only advice given by Mr Pantzer to Dr Wenkart and the creditors of his estate during the course of Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy is that referred to in [22] and [24] above. I therefore accept the accuracy of Mr Gorczyca's evidence in this regard. 59 However, Dr Wenkart's primary submission concerning the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris is that this proceeding has been conducted on the basis of an agreement by Mr Pantzer to have the bills of costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris taxed, and that this agreement is reflected in the orders made by Lindgren J on 21 October 2003. Those orders are reproduced in [2007] FCA 1589 at [22] . It is therefore necessary to review the history of the dealings between Mr Pantzer and Dr Wenkart so far as they touch on the legal costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. 60 The s 73 proposal put forward by Dr Wenkart by letter dated 18 January 2001 provided for certain bank cheques to be given to Mr Pantzer subject to the acceptance of the proposal by his creditors. One of the proposals was: the amount of $105,000.00 (in accordance with your letter of 7 December 2000) less the cash on hand you currently hold (as advised to be approximately $24,000) in the form of a bank cheque for your outstanding legal fees (including any associated with the current proceedings) due to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris up to the date and conclusion of the Section 73 meeting and its implementation. 61 I infer that there had been communication between Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer before Dr Wenkart formulated his s 73 proposal. This appears to be confirmed by par 4 of an affidavit sworn by Mr Pantzer on 8 March 2002. That paragraph reads as follows: At the date of the Section 73 proposal being put to me by the bankrupt on 18 January 2001 I determined the amount of the Trustee's remuneration and costs and disbursements incurred in the administration of the bankrupt estate at that time. Those amounts were $105,000.00 payable to me as Trustee and $105,000.00 payable to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. In proceedings 7051 of 2002 my rights to recover remuneration, costs, charges and expenses were preserved. 78 The context in which Lindgren J came to make orders in this matter on 21 October 2003 was that the docket judge, who was then Beaumont J, was unwell. Lindgren J was thus more than usually dependent on information provided to him by the parties' respective legal representatives. On 11 March 2002 Beaumont J had made the consent orders that are set out in [2007] FCA 1589 at [15] . Those orders provided, in effect, that Dr Wenkart charged the Paddington property to secure the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer was, or might become, lawfully entitled as trustee of his bankrupt estate and recorded that Dr Wenkart ""agreed to pay the same within 28 days of determination of the quantum of the same or at such other time as the parties may agree"". I observe, incidentally, that there is no suggestion that the parties have agreed another time. 79 The orders made by Lindgren J on 21 October 2003 (see [2007] FCA 1589 at [22] ), although made after the filing of the cross-claim, were intended to enable the amount to which Mr Pantzer was ""lawfully entitled"" as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate to be quantified. Those orders in effect, obliged Mr Pantzer to require the persons who had provided services to him with respect to Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate (other than Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris) to supply bills of costs pursuant to s 167 of the Bankruptcy Act and additionally obliged Mr Pantzer to notify Dr Wenkart of his claim for remuneration in respect of services provided after the annulment of Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy. I observe incidentally that the absence of any reference in the order to Mr Pantzer's entitlement to remuneration for services provided before the annulment of Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy supports my above conclusion that Mr Pantzer's entitlement in that regard had by that time been quantified. His Honour noted that Dr Wenkart conceded that upon completion of taxation of the claims for costs and remuneration referred to in the orders, the amount taxed would be amounts to which Mr Pantzer was lawfully entitled within the meaning of the orders made on 11 March 2002. 80 The explanation for Mr Pantzer not being obliged by the orders made on 21 October 2003 to require Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris to supply bills of costs can be found in the transcript of the hearing on that day before Lindgren J. On that day Mr Johnson of counsel appeared for Mr Pantzer. One of the matters debated before his Honour was a procedure for quantifying the amounts to which Mr Pantzer was ""lawfully entitled"" within the meaning of order 1 of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002. Mr Johnson told his Honour: The position that we would seek is orders that we are lawfully entitled to a quantified amount of remuneration and costs and, your Honour, either to give directions as to who that procedure [sic] is to be quantified and then that attached to the charge. Mr Johnson later observed: Well, if your Honour was then minded to consider a position of a regime for quantification, we would say there should be some conditions, because we're concerned about this matter dragging on. 81 Mr Johnson went on to advise his Honour that the judgment of Beaumont J of 6 May 2003 (ie Wenkart v Pantzer [2003] FCA 471) dealt with the amounts due to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. That judgment concerned Mr Pantzer's entitlement to the amount of Ms Sexton's certificate of taxation of 17 February 2003. Mr Johnson agreed with Lindgren J that, because Beaumont J had already determined the amount to which Mr Pantzer was entitled in respect of the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris, those costs should be an exception to the order obliging Mr Pantzer to require service providers to supply bills of costs. Shortly thereafter the transcript records the following exchange concerning the way in which the orders to be made by Lindgren J should be drafted: His Honour: ....We have excluded from that order legal services provided to Mr Pantzer by Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. Now is that correct? That covers all legal services irrespective of when provided by Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris? Mr Johnson: I believe it does, your Honour. And I also believe it extends to their out of pocket expenses, including counsel fees ... His Honour: In other words, that is already subject to the existing taxation? Mr Johnson: Yes. Again, I will check Ms Sexton's taxation records on that, your Honour. It does not appear that Mr Johnson later qualified or withdrew his affirmative answer to the last of Lindgren J's above questions and his Honour thereafter made the orders dated 21 October 2003. 82 For the reasons given above, it appears that Mr Johnson's understanding on 21 October 2003 of the ambit of Ms Sexton's taxation was erroneous. However, I see no reason to conclude that Dr Wenkart's legal representatives were aware of Mr Johnson's error; Dr Wenkart's solicitors had requested a comprehensive taxation of the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. I conclude that it is not now open to Mr Pantzer in this proceeding to adopt an approach that is inconsistent with the basis upon which Lindgren J was invited to make the orders dated 21 October 2003. 83 The transcript of the hearing before Lindgren J on 21 October 2003 also reveals that on that day Mr Johnson accepted that the orders that Lindgren J was being invited to make would extend to other legal services provided to Mr Pantzer, including by him and his instructing solicitors, Sally Nash &amp; Co. Nonetheless, Mr Pantzer now submits that the amounts paid by him to Mr Johnson, Sally Nash &amp; Co and Mr P Walsh of counsel are all amounts to which he is lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart because Dr Wenkart made no request for the relevant bills of costs to be taxed pursuant to s 167 of the Act. Again, I take the view that it is not now open to Mr Pantzer in this proceeding to adopt an approach that is inconsistent with the basis upon which Lindgren J was invited to make the orders dated 21 October 2003. The bill of costs of Sally Nash &amp; Co was certified by a taxing officer on 13 December 2004. The respective bills of costs of Mr Johnson and Mr Walsh were certified by a taxing officer on 12 January 2005. The quantum of Mr Pantzer's costs in respect of the legal services provided by those legal representatives was determined within the meaning of order 1 of the orders of 11 March 2002 by the respective certificates of taxation. 84 As mentioned above, the significance of the date 31 October 2002 is that it is the date of the filing of Mr Pantzer's deemed cross-claim seeking ""an order in aid of [the Court's] order made on 11 March 2002 by appointing Warren Pantzer as Trustee for Sale of the [Paddington property]"" (see [2007] FCA 1589 at [17] ). 85 As noted in [2007] FCA 1589 at [39] - [44] , the Full Court disagreed with the construction initially given by me to the orders made on 11 March 2002 and 21 October 2003. Nonetheless it is, I think, uncontroversial that Dr Wenkart's agreements to pay the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is ""lawfully entitled"" from him is an agreement to pay within 28 days of the determination of the quantum of ""the same"". The charge over the Paddington property secures the payments by him of the relevant amount within that period of time. That is, Mr Pantzer is not entitled to exercise rights under the charge created by order 2 of the consent orders until Dr Wenkart defaults on his agreement to pay. By filing his cross-claim Mr Pantzer sought to exercise rights in reliance on that charge. 86 There is no dispute between the parties that the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate was $769,191.66. It is the payments made by Mr Pantzer that are controversial or perhaps, more accurately, the identification of the date or dates upon which the quantum of the amount or amounts to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled was determined. 87 As indicated above, I accept that the creditors of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate authorised Mr Pantzer's remuneration in an aggregate amount of $325,744.30. Mr Pantzer's schedule reveals that between 13 December 1999 and 10 March 2000 he paid himself 30 cents more than the creditors had authorised. This may be ignored on the de minimis principle. The total amount of authorised payments made by Mr Pantzer to himself by way of remuneration earlier than 31 October 2002 was thus $325,744.60."

In Puddy at 245-246, after reviewing the earlier decisions on the circumstances in which, in the exercise of the discretion, it is appropriate to depart from the general rule requiring an election, Fullagar J said: ""I would add only two observations of my own. In the first place ... something may turn on the nature of the case itself. ... [W]here, as in the case before me, fraud is alleged, it may often be wrong to suggest that a party should submit himself to cross-examination before it is seen that there is really some evidence against him. In the second place, it would seem that the exercise of the discretion must generally involve an estimating of probabilities. If I accede to the application made to me, I may save the parties a great deal of time and expense, or I may cause them much greater expense and delay in the event of a new trial being ordered. In order to assess these probabilities, it seems to me that it must generally be necessary to form some preliminary estimate of the evidence before ruling as to whether the submission is to be entertained without election. In the present case I felt no doubt that I ought to entertain and rule on the submission without requiring the plaintiff to elect to call no evidence. I felt clearly of opinion that the balance of convenience was heavily in favour of this course. The case for the defendant, consisting of the opening and examination in chief, with very little cross-examination, had lasted over three and a half days. Then, coming to determine the application on its merits, I have felt satisfied that there was no case for the plaintiff to answer on defence or counterclaim.""

The protection of that interest in a given case can contrive what is the acceptable area or scope of a restraint: cf Whitehall v Bradford [1952] 1 Ch 236 esp at 249-250 where a ten mile radius restraint on a retiring partner of a medical practice was unsuccessfully challenged, the evidence establishing that, though the patients on the periphery of that area were small in number they contributed about one-third of the total partnership income; see also Kennett v Crawford [1940] SASR 199; C &amp; S Constructions Pty Ltd v Dawson (1991) 13 ATPR 41-148 and Lloyd's Ships Holdings Pty Ltd v Davros Pty Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 505 at 524. Important in this regard for present purposes are observations of Viscount Maugham in the Privy Council in Connors Brothers Ltd v Connors [1940] 4 All ER 179 at 194 in the context of a covenant taken on the sale of a sardine business not to engage in any such business in Canada: ""... the question of reasonableness being a matter of law for the court, it has never yet been supposed that it is necessary in relation to the trade of a large manufacturer or merchant to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the business which the covenant is designed to protect has been carried on in every part of the area mentioned in the covenant. In the cases in which the area has been the whole of England, or a substantial part of it, such as 100 miles or 150 miles from a named town, it has never been held that the covenantee was under an obligation to prove that the business has been carried on in all the towns and villages within the area. In the Nordenfelt case, no attempt was made to prove that all the governments of the world, or even of the civilised world, had ordered goods from the company, though the greater number no doubt had done so. A great deal no doubt depends on the nature of the business and the area in question. In a country of vast spaces, like the Dominion of Canada, it will always be possible, until the population of the country reaches a point now scarcely contemplated, to point to areas where there are only few settlers or inhabitants, and where, accordingly, few, if any, of the goods sold by the manufacturer have penetrated. If, for example, a restrictive covenant were limited to the province of Quebec, it would seldom be possible to prove that the goods were used in every part of that province. However, the goodwill of a business such as is now under consideration could not adequately be protected if the restrictive covenant had to be limited to the towns and villages where actual sales could be proved, whilst leaving the vendor free to establish a business, which would almost certainly be competitive , in all the adjoining places.""

Case15527,referred to,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212,"Whether the Commission used $360,000 as Telstra's costs or not, it gave no reasons for its finding that Telstra's costs would be negligible. The Commission either made a mistake about what Optus submitted or it had no reasons for rejecting Telstra's estimate of $1.7 million. Optus' submission that the Commission had not used the $360,000 as Telstra's costs recognised at least implicitly, that such a use would be a failure by the Commission to have regard to Telstra's direct costs under s 152CR(1)(d). While I think that it is likely that the Commission was confused about Optus' estimate of $360,000 as being an estimate of Telstra's costs, it is not possible to decide one way or the other whether it did because of the Commission's lack of reasons on this matter: Palme 216 CLR at 223-224 [39] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ. 126 I am of opinion that the deficiencies in the Commission's reasons which I have just discussed show that it had no reasons for rejecting Telstra's estimate of $1.7 million and that it did not comply with the requirement of s 152CR(1)(d). 127 Telstra argued that the Commission's approach to Code 569 was reviewable under s 5 of the ADJR Act . It contended that the Commission had: &#8226; failed to observe the procedures required by s 152AQB(9) (s 5(1)(b) of the ADJR Act ); &#8226; improperly exercised its power in making the final determination because it had failed to take into account a relevant consideration (s 5(1)(e) and (2)(b) of the ADJR Act ). 178 In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 76 [73] McHugh and Gummow JJ said that one species of what is known as Wednesbury unreasonableness ( Wednesbury [1948] 1 KB at 230) was identified by Dixon CJ in Klein v Domus Pty Ltd [1963] HCA 54 ; (1963) 109 CLR 467 at 473. There, Dixon CJ said that if it appeared that the dominating or actuating reason for a decision was outside the scope of the purpose of the enactment, that vitiated the supposed exercise of a discretion. Dixon CJ said that the Court looks to the scope and purpose of a provision and what its real object is to determine whether a decision-maker has exercised a discretion in accordance with the purpose of the enactment. However, the Court must approach the exercise from the perspective that the real object of the legislature is to leave the scope for judicial or other officer who is investigating the facts and considering the purpose of the enactment to give effect to his or her view of the justice of the case: see too S20/2002 198 ALR at 75-76 [67]-[70]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 221 [30] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ. A decision which is so unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith or so absurd that no sensible person could dream that it lay within the powers of the decision-maker is affected by jurisdictional error: Palme 216 CLR at 221 [30]. 182 In Palme 216 CLR at 223-224 [39], Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ referred to this principle. They distinguished it from a situation where a decision-maker did not give any reason for his or her decision, when the Court may be able to infer that he had no good reason (cf: per Gibbs CJ in Public Service Board (NSW) v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1986) 159 CLR 656 at 663-664)."

Case9294,considered,Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All E R 560 ,"In terms of Australian jurisprudence, the lawfulness in particular circumstances of a practice within public administration of delegates of a responsible Minister or permanent head or equivalent such as the Commissioner authorising subordinates to exercise delegated powers in their name finds recognition at ultimate appellate level in O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners [1983] HCA 47 ; (1982-1983) 153 CLR 1 at 12-14 per Gibbs CJ, Murphy J agreeing in this regard and at 30-33 per Wilson J. It is also the subject of an influential advisory opinion given by Brennan J in his Honour's then capacity as President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Re Reference under Ombudsman Act s 11 (1979) 2 ALD 86. These, in turn, give local recognition to a principle of public law in the United Kingdom in relation to the administration of large Departments of State which has come to be known as ""the Carltona principle"", so named for a leading authority on the subject in that country, Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All E R 560. These and other authorities on the subject are helpfully collected and discussed in Aronson, Dyer and Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action , 3rd Edition, at pp 310-318. 43 I am relieved from considering whether authorisation in accordance with the Carltona principle was possible at all in relation to the making of a DPO because it was not submitted that the power to make a DPO, though described in Poletti's Case (at 160) as a ""severe intrusion into a person's liberty, privacy and freedom of movement"", was of such a nature as to require the decision personally to be made by the Commissioner or a delegate. It was accepted by the Appellant that it was permissible for the authorised person to decide to make the DPO with that decision being the act of the delegate. 44 The submission made on behalf of Mr Pattenden was that, accepting that the regime of delegation and authorisation was lawfully possible, it was not permissible for the authorised person, in turn, to consign substantive aspects of the making of the decision to subordinates. It was, rightly, no part of that submission that it was impermissible for an authorised person such as Mr Benson, having made a decision to make a DPO, to consign to a subordinate consequential, wholly procedural, clerical or ""ministerial"" tasks such as the affixing of a facsimile of the Deputy Commissioner's signature to the DPO or the communication to Mr Pattenden of the making of the DPO. Rather, the submission was that, when one examined the facts of this case, the decision as made and evidenced by the DPO was not that of Mr Benson in all key respects. 51 For the Commissioner, the submission was advanced that, in a relative sense, the assessment debt and the credits which were inserted were minor. That, with respect, is an unattractive submission. Assuming, as the parties have, that the nature of the power to make a DPO admits of the application of the Carltona principle at all, it nonetheless remains a power that entails a serious intrusion on a person's freedom of movement. There is therefore every reason to expect that the non-procedural aspects of the decision will be made only by the authorised officer. Mr Benson never made a decision to make a DPO in respect of the taxation liability specified in the purported DPO of 21 May 2008. The decision to insert a different taxation liability in that order was that of unauthorised subordinates. 52 I have no reason to doubt that, when Mr Sivasubramaniam affixed the Deputy Commissioner's signature to the DPO which issued to Mr Pattenden, he did so in good faith. It was nonetheless not only an insubordinate act but an unauthorised one. In so doing, he presumed that on 21 May 2008, knowing of the further taxation liability and of the credits, Mr Benson would remain of the view that the making of a DPO was appropriate. Like comment may be made in respect of the actions of whomever it was in ""Debt Management"" who presumed, without authority, to insert into the draft of the DPO liabilities and credits or payments of which Mr Benson was unaware when he made the decision to make a DPO on 21 April 2008. The addition of the additional taxation liability and of the further payments or credits was not a procedural step. Neither, in light of that, was the affixing of the facsimile of the Deputy Commissioner's signature to a DPO in that form. 53 What Mr Benson's subordinates have done is to conflate two features of the DPO regime. Section 14S contemplates the making of a DPO in respect of a taxation liability. It is the amount of that liability which must be inserted into the DPO. Once a DPO has been made: (a) it remains in force until it is revoked or until it is set aside by a court: s 14S(2) of the TAA; and (b) s 14T of the TAA then has effect."
Case18654,cited,"Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd [2001] HCA 31 , 207 CLR 165","A more generally expressed submission advanced by the Trustee that it was a part of the fiduciary duty owed by a director to make full disclosure is rejected. "" The strong weight of judicial authority is that fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive; accordingly, a fiduciary does not have a positive duty to disclose information "": Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 963 at [375] , [2007] FCA 963 ; 160 FCR 35 at 88 per Jacobson J. Reference may also be made to one of the authorities there referred to by His Honour, namely Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 , 186 CLR 71. Gaudron and McHugh JJ there observed (at 113): In this country, fiduciary obligations arise because a person has come under an obligation to act in another's interests. As a result, equity imposes on the fiduciary proscriptive obligations -- not to obtain any unauthorised benefit from the relationship and not to be in a position of conflict. If these obligations are breached, the fiduciary must account for any profits and make good any losses arising from the breach. But the law of this country does not otherwise impose positive legal duties on the fiduciary to act in the interests of the person to whom the duty is owed. If there was a general fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the patient, it would necessarily follow that a doctor has a duty to inform the patient that he or she has breached their contract or has been guilty of negligence in dealings with the patient. That is not the law of this country. Gummow J concluded (at 137 8): Fiduciary obligations arise (albeit perhaps not exclusively) in various situations where it may be seen that one person is under an obligation to act in the interests of another. Equitable remedies are available where the fiduciary places interest in conflict with duty or derives an unauthorised profit from abuse of duty. It would be to stand established principle on its head to reason that because equity considers the defendant to be a fiduciary, therefore the defendant has a legal obligation to act in the interests of the plaintiff so that failure to fulfil that positive obligation represents a breach of fiduciary duty.

Gummow J also observed in Thompson at 22: 'At common law, the liability of joint tortfeasors was said to be joint and several.

Case24287,cited,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Slaven [1984] FCA 31 ; (1984) 1 FCR 1,"In Groves v United Pacific Transport, the plaintiff apparently argued that the damages would be taxable under the predecessor to s 26(d) of the ITAA 1936 ([64] above). Gibbs J rejected the argument (at 64-65): 'The answer is in my opinion to be found by considering the true nature of the damages awarded in such a case. In Graham v Baker [1961] HCA 48 ; (1961) 106 CLR 340 , at pp 346-7, Dixon CJ, and Kitto and Taylor JJ said: ""So far the matter has been discussed as if the right of a plaintiff whose earning capacity has been diminished by the defendant's negligence is concerned with two separate matters, i.e., loss of wages up to the time of trial and an estimated future loss because of his diminished earning capacity. It is, we think, necessary to point out that this is not so. A plaintiff's right of action is complete at the time when his injuries are sustained and if it were possible in the ordinary course of things to obtain an assessment of his damages immediately it would be necessary to make an assessment of the probable economic loss which would result from his injuries. But for at least two obvious reasons it has been found convenient to assess an injured plaintiff's loss by reference to the actual loss of wages which occurs up to the time of trial and which can be more or less precisely ascertained and then, having regard to the plaintiff's proved condition at the time of trial, to attempt some assessment of his future loss."" Their Honours went on to say that ""an injured plaintiff recovers not merely because his earning capacity has been diminished but because the diminution of his earning capacity is or may be productive of financial loss. Although it is usual and convenient in an action for damages for personal injuries to say that an amount is awarded for loss of wages or other earnings, the damages are really awarded for the impairment of the plaintiff's earning capacity that has resulted from his injuries. This is so even if an amount is separately quantified and described as special damages for loss of earnings up to the time of trial. Damages for personal injuries are not rightly described as damages for loss of income. It follows that in my opinion an award of damages for personal injuries does not come within the description of ""an indemnity for or in respect of any loss of income"" within s 26(j) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act and that such an award is not income in accordance with ordinary concepts so as to be taxable apart from the special provisions of that section. In determining what financial loss the plaintiff has probably suffered up to the date of trial by reason of the impairment of his earning capacity, as well as in considering what financial loss he is likely to suffer in future, I must therefore take his tax position into account.'

He asserted that the Tribunal misapplied the test when it affirmed the decision of the Trustee. That complaint is, in my view, to be rejected for at least two reasons. First, it ignores the fact that the Tribunal properly described and applied the test as outlined in [41] above. Secondly, Mr Samaras misunderstood the Tribunal's reasons for decision and, in particular, sought to take one sentence of the reasons out of context. The Tribunal's reasons "" are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error"" : Pozzolanic at 287. They are to be read fairly as a whole and not over zealously: Wu Shan Liang at 271-272.

As it happens, and having regard to inconsistencies which it highlighted, the Tribunal did not accept the claim advanced. The Tribunal's reasons for so doing are logical. As the learned Federal Magistrate observed at para 30 of her Honour's reasons for judgment by reference to what had been said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405 at [67] , credibility is a matter for the Tribunal ""par excellence"", and the Tribunal's findings were open to it for the reasons it gave on the material before it. 19 There is then, in my opinion, no substance in ground 2. 20 These conclusions are themselves enough to dispose of the appeal. However, it is desirable that attention be drawn to a further passage which appears in the Tribunal's reasons at Appeal Book page 214. The Tribunal there states: The Tribunal does not accept the applicant's I interpolate, the male Appellant's claim that the police refused to protect him because of the influence of his enemy. The independent information which the Tribunal accepts, overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the police in Gujarat favour the BJP. The Tribunal is satisfied that if the applicant had, in the past, been unable to obtain help from the police, or from his party leaders, it is because any difficulties he had were too trivial. The Tribunal is satisfied that were he to suffer serious harm, or threat of harm amounting to persecution, the state authorities would provide effective protection."

His Honour also there referred to the following summary of propositions provided by Hill J in Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd [1993] FCA 585 ; (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201: (1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order ... (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits, for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine for itself the case on the merits or, as it might be put, to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial.... This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them ... (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation ... (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted, the Court may take into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted ... Some reservation has been expressed as to whether each party should bear its own costs in the circumstances contemplated by Finkletstein J "" except in special circumstances "": Champagne View Pty Ltd v Shearwater Resort Management Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 214 at [47] per Gillard J. Concurrence is, however, expressed with respect to the general approach as set forth by both Finkelstein and Hill JJ. 22 The approach set forth by Finkelstein J in Gribbles Pathology does not preclude consideration being given to such an assessment as to prospects of success of an application or a motion filed in proceedings. It may well be inappropriate to entertain submissions for the purpose of forming an assessment as to prospects of success solely to inform the discretion as to costs; but where agreement as to the manner in which proceedings may be resolved has been reached only at a point of time when the Court has in fact entertained submissions and been informed as to the competing submissions of the parties, any preliminary view that a Court has reached at that point of time may be taken into account when making an order as to costs. 23 Such practical success as the Applicant may have achieved in securing the assurance from the Minister that there was to be no reliance placed upon the November 2007 notice -- and perhaps thereby entitling him to an order for costs in his favour -- has been very much tempered by the lack of success that he would in all likelihood have suffered had the Motion proceeded to decision. Moreover, the discontinuance of the proceedings has denied the Respondent Minister the opportunity of vindicating his position. 24 This assessment of the competing positions of the parties has also been a consideration upon which considerable reliance has been placed in concluding that there should be no order for costs."

Any departure from the ordinary rule that costs should be paid on a party-party basis requires the presence of something special or unusual in the conduct of the case to be demonstrated: see Preston v Preston [1981] 3 WLR 619 at 637. The types of case in which it may be appropriate to award indemnity costs do not fall in any closed categories: see Tetijo Holdings Pty Ltd v Keeprite Australia Pty Ltd (unreported, French J, 3 May 1991). One type of case in which it has been held that indemnity costs might be ordered is that in which an applicant pursues a hopeless case.

In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law. Such cases are, fortunately, rare. But when they occur, the Court will need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion.""

Case12513,applied,Citicorp Australia Ltd v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1996) 141 ALR 667,"In Citicorp Australia Ltd v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1996) 141 ALR 667 a Full Court dealt with a similar question arising under the Bankruptcy Act . The Court observed at 682, upon the basis of English and Australian authorities, that it is only in a clear case that the Court should come to the view that the proposed assignment is frivolous or vexatious or that the Court should not allow the assignment to occur. 41 Their Honours pointed to the observations of Lord Hoffman in the English decision in Stein v Blake (1996) 1 AC 243 at 260. The relevant passage was set out by the Full Court in Citicorp at 681. It is unnecessary to repeat what Lord Hoffman said in that passage. 42 The observations of the Full Court in Citicorp at 679 are also pertinent. Their Honours observed that there will be few cases where some decisive point exists on which the trustee or the Court can be satisfied that the claim which is proposed to be assigned has no reasonable prospects of success. 43 In the present case it is relevant to note, as I have already, that the cross-claims brought by Mr Selim against the Commonwealth and the TGA offices were the subject of a strikeout application but that the Commonwealth ultimately determined not to pursue that application after amendments were made to the pleadings. 44 In those circumstances, it seems to me to be the position that it is not clear and obvious that any proceeding in respect of the cause of action against the Commonwealth would have no reasonable prospects of success. Accordingly, there is no basis for me to conclude that the assignment of the causes of action to Mr Selim would result in vexatious or improper litigation, so the assignment cannot be said to be an inappropriate exercise of the liquidator's powers. 45 There are a number of other reasons why it seems to me that the liquidators are justified in assigning the causes of action to Mr Selim. It is not necessary to state them in any detail. I have referred to some of them above but in summary there are three principal reasons. 46 First, the proceedings would be lengthy and expensive and if they proceed to a final hearing there is always the risk of the insolvent estate of Pan being exposed to a substantial costs order in the event that the claims against Mr Selim fail."
Case14077,referred to,Blair v Curran (1939) 62 CLR 464,The first requirement draws attention to the need to identify with precision the issue which was necessarily decided in the earlier proceeding to see whether it is identical with an issue sought to be raised in the later proceeding: Blair v Curran (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 531; Makhoul v Barnes (1995) 60 FCR 572 at 579. 59 The observations of Dixon J in Blair v Curran at 531 make it plain that the question which is the subject of the first requirement may be one of fact or law.
Case3864,cited,Armorduct Manufacturing Company Ltd v General Incandescent Company Ltd [1911] 2 KB 143,"Section 468 of the Act provides that any disposition of property of a company, other than an exempt disposition, made after the commencement of the winding up of the company by the Court is void, unless the Court otherwise orders. In an application under s 468 or its equivalent, the Court has a discretion to order that a disposition of property is not void. It may be that, where a creditor has been prevented by force or by fraud or trickery from issuing execution or attachment prior to the commencement of a winding up, the Court would order that the execution or attachment is not void (see Armorduct Manufacturing Company Ltd v General Incandescent Company Ltd [1911] 2 KB 143 at 147. 27 However, there is no power given to the Court under s 569 to order that s 569 not apply. In any event, there is simply no evidence before the Court to suggest that there was any fraud or trickery that resulted in any delay in obtaining the garnishee order that resulted in the payment from the Bank to Sandos. Accordingly, there is no basis for suggesting that this ground for setting aside the statutory demand has any substance. 28 Sandos contends that it is, at most, liable to pay the amount received following the garnishee order, less an amount in respect of the costs of the garnishee order. It says that, since that amount has not been determined, it is not possible to determine the amount payable."
Case17310,applied,Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165,"the claims under ss 51AC and 52 of the Act must be approached on the basis that there is a written agreement between the parties containing terms which are expressly in the teeth of alleged representations or of alleged oral contractual terms. Absent some misrepresentation, the written agreement executed by the person complaining must be taken as authoritative: Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [39] , 180-183 [45]-[50]. The process of negotiation was pleaded and was also referred to by Mr Harrison in his affidavit. The time in which substantial cost and effort were said to have been expended causing old Boston damage in preparing its proposal, involved about 9 days in February 2004. Following that, whatever may have happened in the meantime about which no complaint is made, only in November 2004 was the GE Capital contract signed. The GE Capital contract appears to have been the result of a long process of negotiation. There is no suggestion that its terms were misrepresented. However, the written form of the GE Capital contract expressly negated any promise of a particular level of referrals to old Boston by GE Capital (Services Sch par 3). Old Boston had every opportunity to review the proffered terms which, according to Mr Harrison, GE Capital had sent in early September 2004 before it signed them in November 2004. There is no basis that appears in the pleading or in Mr Harrison's affidavit to support a claim that the express terms of the GE Capital contract were misrepresented to old Boston before it signed. Further, the statement of claim pleads the claim under s 51AC in a way which is not easy to comprehend. It does not disclose any intelligible basis on which it could be found that GE Capital acted in contravention of s 51AC by proffering the GE Capital contract to old Boston for consideration before signing. The allegations have no substance. The manner in which GE Capital was performing during the period in which old Boston purported to carry out the GE Capital contract indicated that the GE Capital was not acting on the basis of any such promise. Both old and new Boston knew this by July 2005. These factors induce me to consider that the claims have no reasonable prospect of succeeding although I cannot say that it is hopeless or bound to fail. I think that this view is reinforced by the difficulty with which the pleader has sought to articulate the claims. In Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 180-183 [45] - [50] the High Court held that where parties had signed a written contract, they were to be taken as intending the act of signature to be conclusive, absent misrepresentation or fraud. While misrepresentations had been pleaded as to the statements made many months earlier in February 2004, when the parties actually signed the written agreement on 9 November 2004, there is no material before me which suggests that old Boston could have been acting under the influence of any misrepresentation as to the terms of the GE Capital contract. Its terms were in writing, they had been provided to old Boston in advance. They were not in the form of a contract of adhesion. Old Boston was free to sign or not the GE Capital contract as it pleased. Old Boston had the opportunity to review and consider the draft or proffered terms. In those circumstances, I consider that there is no reasonable prospect that old Boston would be able to establish, as alleged in the statement of claim, that there was a term of the GE Capital contract that some minimum number of field calls would be referred to old Boston per month. Such a proposition is not only expressly excluded by express words in the services schedule of the GE Capital contract, it is also inconsistent with the entire agreement clause. In considering the claim in contract, it is important to appreciate that there is no claim that the GE Capital contract was vitiated by misrepresentation. Rather, it is claimed that an additional term was made either orally or by conduct which was part of that contract, although inconsistent with the express terms to which I have just referred. In Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [39] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ referred to the position of a person acting on behalf of a company who signed a contractual document without reading it. They noted that the person could have read the contract had he wished and that the other party did not set out to conceal from him the terms and conditions on the document or to encourage him not to read them. As their Honours said, the other party '... had no way of knowing that he did not read the document. No case of mistake or non est factum is advanced'. They continued (219 CLR at 179 [40]: 'This Court, in Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas ((2004) [2004] HCA 35 ; 218 CLR 451), has recently reaffirmed the principle of objectivity by which the rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract are determined. It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations. What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement. The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean. That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text, but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction ( Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at 461-462 [22] ).' In trade and commerce, it is important that the courts encourage certainty in contractual relations. Here the parties entered into a contract at arms length in which there was a full opportunity to negotiate and where, as also in Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [39] - [40] , 182 [47], the parties had a full opportunity beforehand to consider the written terms which they signed. Neither party insisted on including what is now said to be a critical and agreed term which is inconsistent with what they signed. I do not think that there is any reasonable prospect that old Boston would have been able to establish that the alleged term as to the minimum number of field calls per month was in fact a term of the GE Capital contract. As Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ said (219 CLR at 180-181 [45]): 'It should not be overlooked that to sign a document known and intended to affect legal relations is an act which itself ordinarily conveys a representation to a reasonable reader of the document. The representation is that the person who signs either has read and approved the contents of the document or is willing to take the chance of being bound by those contents, as Latham CJ put it, whatever they might be. That representation is even stronger where the signature appears below a perfectly legible written request to read the document before signing it.' Moreover, cl 20(a)(v) of the GE Capital contract provided that GE Capital was able without liability to terminate that agreement immediately by written notice if old Boston entered into liquidation or any other type of insolvency or if it ceased to conduct business to properly give effect to the GE Capital contract. By cl 20(b) GE Capital was also able to end the GE Capital agreement or a particular services schedule at its discretion at any time by giving 14 days written notice. Next, cl 20(d), provided that if GE Capital did terminate the GE Capital contract, other than pursuant to cl 20(b) no further amounts would be payable to old Boston even if they had already been invoiced. Again, the existence of those clauses tends to suggest that any term involving the non-termination of the GE Capital agreement for the proposed two year term could not be implied into the agreement and no such representation would have any reasonable prospect of being established. Accordingly, while it may be arguable that old Boston incurred expenses in performing the task of preparing a response to GE Capital's invitation to provide field services in February 2004, and to that extent incurred some damage, I am of opinion that by the time the GE Capital contract was entered into in November 2004 the effect of those representations was well and truly spent. There is nothing in the material before me to indicate there is any reasonable prospect of new Boston establishing that it is entitled to enforce a contractual term to the effect alleged or that it can rely upon any representations or contraventions of s 52 of the Act. New Boston sought to argue that the GE Capital contract was constructed on the basis of a price per call which old Boston had provided in February 2004 after doing the analysis based on the minimum number of calls per month. While that may have been the subjective intention of old Boston, the written agreement which it and GE Capital signed in November 2004 does not reflect anything other than a price which both parties were prepared to agree would be payable upon GE Capital referring any calls to old Boston: Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] . GE Capital also argued that on its proper construction the sale agreement did not purport to assign the right of old Boston to claims it may have had as at the date of the sale agreement for breach of contract or under the Act, even if the latter were assignable."
Case15581,cited,Conde v Hunter [2009] FMCA 751,"Conde commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court to have the bankruptcy notice set aside and interim orders granting an extension of time for him to comply with the bankruptcy notice. The matter came before Wilson FM, who dismissed the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice ( Conde v Hunter [2009] FMCA 751). In his reasons for decision, his Honour found in summary as follows: Mr Conde made no attack on the form of the bankruptcy notice itself. Although Mr Conde contended that Mr Hunter did not have a final judgment or final order (the execution of which had not been stayed in terms of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("" Bankruptcy Act "")) the argument was misconceived. His Honour continued: A final order is one that disposes finally of an issue between the parties. The concept of what is a final order is discussed in cases such as Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423. In this case, the issue was who should pay the costs of the application to set aside the applicant's pleading. The order made by Judge Searles was a final order, insofar as it concerned that issue. His Honour ordered that the applicant pay the respondent's costs. There is no merit in the first ground sought to be advanced by the applicant. (at [3]) Notwithstanding Mr Conde's prospective challenge to Orders 3 and 4 of Searles DCJ, it was clear on the material before his Honour that: because the order sought to be challenged on appeal was only as to costs, leave to appeal was required by the Court of Appeal; the application for leave to appeal was filed many months out of time and therefore required an order from the Court of Appeal granting an extension of time. The Federal Magistrate noted that no contest had been made against the Orders 1 and 2 made by Searles DCJ, namely to strike out Mr Conde's amended statement of claim and give leave to Mr Conde to replead in that Court. The Federal Magistrate considered that, in those circumstances and having read Mr Conde's application to the Court of Appeal and supporting affidavit, that application to the Court of Appeal has no prospects of success. It followed that no good reason was shown for either setting aside the bankruptcy notice or extending time for compliance with it to await the outcome in the Queensland Court of Appeal. Accordingly the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice. Appeal from decision of the Federal Magistrate While failure of a Court to consider an issue before it and supporting submissions may constitute a miscarriage of justice ( QBE Insurance Ltd v Switzerland Insurance Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd [1996] HCA 1 ; (1996) 134 ALR 433) I can draw no inference that his Honour had regard only to the submissions filed by Mr Hunter and ignored either the substance of Mr Conde's case or the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and rules. It is clear from reviewing the decision of the Federal Magistrate ( Conde v Hunter [2009] FMCA 751) that his Honour:"

The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the Australian Broadcasting Commission ('the ABC') was not an 'instrumentality or agency of the Government of the Commonwealth', within the meaning of s 114 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1972 1975 (SA). At 284, Bray CJ, with whom Hogarth J agreed, referred to Electricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd [1950] SASR 133, in which it was held that the Electricity Trust of South Australia was a government instrumentality, as it managed the undertaking for the supply of electricity and the mining of coal in South Australia, exercised its functions on behalf of the Crown, and was the means or agency for managing a Crown asset. At 284 285, Bray CJ conceded that the ABC might be regarded as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, but expressed the view that it could not be regarded as an instrumentality of the 'Government' of the Commonwealth. His Honour took the view that the word 'Government', with a capital initial, in s 114 meant the executive government of the Commonwealth. At 285, his Honour examined various provisions of the statute creating the ABC, emphasising the degree of autonomy from the executive government enjoyed by the ABC (with ministerial control only over a small number of specified functions, or in some exceptional specified circumstances), and the obligation of the ABC to indemnify the Postmaster-General in respect of any claim for anything done by the Postmaster-General's Department at the request of the ABC. His Honour also pointed out that there was nothing in the statute declaring that the ABC held its assets on behalf of the Crown. At 285 286, Bray CJ also regarded as relevant the question whether the degree of ministerial control was sufficient to entitle the ABC to the shield of the Crown. Assuming it to have been decided correctly, the ABC case is readily distinguishable from the present."

Case16781,applied,Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165,"eBay contends that a contract in writing was made on the terms displayed on the Online Fulfilment website. eBay argues the contract was, in effect, signed electronically by the purchaser through his or her clicking on the relevant buttons agreeing to the terms and conditions, making payment and receiving the webpage and email confirmations of the order. On this analysis the contract was signed and completed after the payment and nominated purchaser details were accepted. The terms of the signed contract were those set out in the webpages detailing the terms and conditions in accordance with Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165. 25 eBay argues that, objectively, a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have concluded that terms and conditions upon which the ticket was sold to the purchaser were those repeated five times throughout the process on the different webpages. These incorporated old condition 6. The ticket that was delivered in consequence of a transaction occurring online before 8 November 2006, however, contained new condition 6 which eBay says can have no contractual force or effect because it had been added without agreement after the contract was made. Thus, eBay says, in addition to the other inaccuracies it claims, the ticket in such cases is misleading because of its different terms and it conveys a false representation that new condition 6 is a part of the contract. 26 Creative contends that new condition 6 is merely a statement in different language to the same force and effect of old condition 6 and has no difference in substance. 49 The Ticketmaster online purchase was a contract in writing signed by the parties. By clicking on the relevant buttons and, by the computer bringing up all terms needed to purchase a ticket, on behalf of Ticketmaster as agent for Creative, the whole transaction was in writing, signed and agreed by the parties. A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have regarded the transaction completed on Ticketmasters' webpage as the contract: Toll (FCGT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165."
Case2212,followed,Sharp Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (1995) 59 FCR 6,"I am satisfied that the Tribunal addressed the correct question, understood the arguments and had regard to all relevant considerations and ignored irrelevant ones. This was a situation in which the Tribunal was not obliged to give more reasons than s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act required. It set out its findings on material questions of fact and referred to the evidence and other material on which they were based, explaining logically why it came to the characterisation it did: cf: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at 422-423; [2000] HCA 1 ; 74 ALJR 405 at 416-417 [65] - [67] per McHugh J. As Davies and Beazley JJ said in Sharp Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (1995) 59 FCR 6 at 13F-G, it is fundamentally a question of fact whether goods have an essential character and what that character is (see too at 14G-15B; and per Hill J at 16A)."
Case8644,applied,Mallinson v Scottish Australian Investment Co Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66 ,"Commissioner's primary submission is that each amount, the subject of a notice under s 260- 5 , is recoverable by an action in debt under the principles of the general law as explained by the High Court in the following passage from its unanimous judgment in Mallinson v Scottish Australian Investment Co Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66: The rule applicable here is stated in Shepherd v Hills as follows, viz, 'Wherever an Act of Parliament creates a duty or obligation to pay money, an action will lie for its recovery, unless the Act contains some provision to the contrary'; and where the amount is liquidated the action of debt is appropriate. The obligation is none the less a debt because the statute gives no particular method of enforcing it. In cases in which the statute contains no express denial of the right to bring an action, the proper course to adopt in order to determine whether it contains 'some provision to the contrary' within the meaning of the rule stated above is to consider whether it appears from the whole purview of the Act that it was the intention of the Legislature that the remedy provided should be a substitute for the right of action which would otherwise exist; and in determining this question it is material to consider whether the obligation imposed by the Act was designed to benefit a particular class of persons .... It is also material to consider whether the provision made by the Act for compelling obedience to its commands is in the nature of a penalty for disobedience or in the nature of compensation to the person whose rights are affected by the failure to perform the obligations imposed by the Act. [The case citations have been omitted]. The respondent argues, applying the Shepherd v Hills proviso adopted in Mallinson , that s 260-20 constitutes a ""provision to the contrary"", which denies the right to sue for recovery that would otherwise arise by implication. This is because, it submits, s 260-20 provides a sanction for non-compliance with a notice under the criminal law, with power in the criminal court in its discretion to order payment of an appropriate sum to the Commissioner. Section 260-20 relevantly provides: Offence (1) The third party must not fail to comply with the Commissioner's notice. Penalty: 20 penalty units (2) The court may, in addition to imposing a penalty on a person convicted of an offence against subsection (1) in relation to failing to pay an amount under the notice, order the person to pay to the Commissioner an amount not exceeding that amount. As to s 260-20, there is no general principle that the availability of civil remedies is excluded by provision for a criminal sanction with a discretionary power to order payment of monies due. I do not consider that the Parliament intended the criminal sanctions in s 260-20 to be the exclusive means of enforcing a notice. The respondent further submits that s 255-5, which provides for an express regime of civil recovery but does not extend to amounts arising under s 260-5, is also ""a provision to the contrary"". This seeks, in effect, to apply the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius as an aid to construction. It is an aid which must be used with caution: Houssein v Under Secretary of Industrial Relations and Technology [1982] HCA 2 ; (1982) 148 CLR 88 at 94; Barratt v Howard [1999] FCA 1132 ; (1999) 165 ALR 605 at 615 per Hely J. If applied in this case it would bring about a result which I doubt the Parliament intended: Ainsworth v CJC [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 575. The existence of affirmative provisions elsewhere in the Act does not, in my opinion, override the principle articulated in Mallinson . The references to ""tax payable"" and ""tax due"" are significant. I apprehend the Court here was saying no more than that under s 218 the third party was, unlike s 255, not liable to pay the ""tax payable"". Section 255(1)(c) rendered the ""controller"" of monies of a non-resident personally liable for the tax payable on behalf of the non-resident. Section 218, by contrast, created a new obligation for payment to the Commissioner of ""money due, accruing or (which) may become due"" by a person to a taxpayer, albeit the payment of that money by the person to the Commissioner was to be credited against the taxpayer's liability to tax. However, it did not in terms enable the Commissioner to recover from the other person the tax due by the taxpayer. The provisions to which I have referred in the ITAA36 concerning assessments of tax have no immediate application in respect of s 218. This, in my view, is how the distinction between ss 218 and 255 referred to in Bluebottle should be understood. I would expect that had the Court meant that s 218 provided no capacity for the Commissioner to sue for recovery of amounts the subject of a notice other than through criminal proceedings, it would have referred to earlier High Court authority on the subject such as Clyne and particularly the principle explained in Mallinson . Indeed Clyne was applied in Bluebottle in dealing with another issue and Mallinson was also referred to but not on this point. I do not regard Bluebottle as overruling the principle articulated in Mallinson."

On 1 June 2007, a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship refused the application. In his reasons, the delegate did not specifically provide reasons for refusing the applications with respect to the three children. On the application for review to the Tribunal, the Tribunal member said that as the three children had been joined to the first applicant's application then ""by implication"" the applications by the children had also been refused."

The general rule of practice is that a 'no case' submission will not be entertained or, alternatively, no ruling made unless the moving party elects to call no evidence ( Protean (Holdings) Ltd v American House Assurance Co. [1985] VR 187; Stevenson v Barham [1977] HCA 4 ; (1977) 136 CLR 190 at page 202, per Mason and Jacobs JJ) although, the general rule is not an 'inflexible rule' ( Compaq Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Merry &amp; Ors (1998) 157 ALR 1 at page 7) and not necessarily the 'right course in every kind of case' ( Parry v Aluminium Corporation [1940] WN 44 at 46 per Goddard LJ). The general rule must 'give way to particular circumstances' in the exercise of the discretion ( Stevenson v Barham (supra) at page 203, per Mason and Jacobs JJ) and ultimately the matter is one for the discretion of the judge having regard to the just and convenient disposition of the litigation ( Protean at page 238 per Tadgell J) or, as French J observes, a function of judicial case management conditioned by the circumstances of the case ( J-Corp Pty Ltd v Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (Western Australian Branch) &amp; Ors (No. 2) (1992) 38 FCR 458. 85 Nevertheless, the generality of the usual practice is well recognised and approved by the High Court ( Stevenson v Barham (supra) at page 202; Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn (Australasia's Asia) Pty Ltd v Collier's Interstate Transport Services Ltd (1955 1956) [1956] HCA 6 ; 94 CLR 384 at pg 402 per Fullagar J), recognised by the Federal Court ( James &amp; Ors v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985 86) 64 ALR 347 per Toohey J at pg 400 (Appendix); Compaq v Merry (supra) at pgs 6 and 7) and applied in State superior courts (see the discussion of the authorities by Finkelstein J in Compaq v Merry (supra) at pages 6 and 7)."
Case5395,cited,R v Civoniceva; Ex parte Attorney-General [1983] 2 Qd R 633,"Pincus J concluded at 534 that the order for restitution was not a penalty under s 82(3) because it did not fall within the description of a 'punishment' as that term was used in the Criminal Code (Qld), and because the victim of the crime could clearly have proved in bankruptcy for the sums stolen. That is, the obligation underlying the order sought to be stayed was a debt provable in bankruptcy. His Honour preferred the 'non-punitive' characterisation of the restitution order to the views of Gibbs J in Caddies , partly in reliance upon the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Civoniceva; Ex parte Attorney-General [1983] 2 Qd R 633 at 634-635.

Case13877,followed,"Secretary, Department of Health and Aging v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545","parties urged that no difference in approach to fixing an agreed civil penalty was called for under the Act as compared to the approach taken under legislation such as under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 42Y of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth). They relied on what Flick J had said in Secretary, Department of Health and Aging v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [17] , [23]-[25]. He helpfully reviewed a large number of cases imposing civil penalties arising under a number of Acts: Pagasa [2008] FCA 1545 at [23] - [27] , concluding at [27]: ""Although the form of words set forth in other legislative provisions may be the same or comparable to those employed in the 1989 Act, the legislative mandate that the Court "" must have regard to all relevant matters "" in s 42Y(3) assumes obvious importance. It is that mandate which directs attention to those more specific matters which can only be discerned from an analysis of the 1989 Act itself. Of central importance in identifying those matters which are "" relevant "" &#8212; and which must therefore be taken into account &#8212; are the objects and purposes of the 1989 Act."" I agree with Flick J's approach to the construction of provisions like s 205F(3) of the Act. French J remarked in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 the other general objects of the criminal law apart from deterrence, namely retribution and rehabilitation, had no ""... part to play in economic regulation of the kind contemplated by Pt IV"" of the Trade Practices Act ."
Case8345,cited,Priestley v Godwin (Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner) [2008] HCA 59 ; (2008) 251 ALR 612,"Priestley made submissions concerning orders made at an earlier stage of these proceedings by a judge of the Court. No appeal or application for leave to appeal was brought against those orders in this Court. However, it appears that those orders were the subject of consideration by the High Court in Priestley v Godwin (Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner) (2008) 251 CLR 612. In that case, French CJ said that Mr Priestley's allegations regarding those previous orders were ' baseless '. I indicated to Mr Priestley that I would not deal with his submissions regarding those previous orders in these proceedings and I do not do so. In his application, Mr Priestley also seeks orders that he be provided with a statement in writing setting out the findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based and giving reasons for the claimed decision dated 10 May 2007, as well as disclosure of the evidence or other material on which the findings on material questions of fact were based. To the extent that this represents an additional order to the order sought to provide reasons for the claimed decision, it is also predicated upon there having been a decision as Mr Priestley characterised it made on that date. The relevant facts as to whether or not the claimed decision was made and what decision was made are evident from the documentary material in evidence. There was no claimed decision. He is not entitled to these orders. The decision for which Mr Priestley seeks reasons was not made. Mr Priestley's application has no reasonable prospect of success.

Case15994,cited,Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR 1,"A ringtone is a fragment of a musical work in digital form which is intended to be delivered to and to function as the ring of a mobile telephone: Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR 1 at 3 [9] per Lindgren P. The President found that in storing ringtones on its computers, a ringtone supplier makes a reproduction of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones for the purposes of s 31(1)(a)(i) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). In electronically transmitting ringtones to a mobile telephone, the ringtone supplier exercises the right of communication to the public in respect of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones (s 31(1)(a)(iv) of the Act: s 10(1) contains a definition of the word 'communicate' as meaning to 'make available online or electronically transmit ... a work or other subject matter'). By providing an IVR service, a ringtone supplier authorizes the making of the copy of the ringtones which are created in the customer's mobile telephones upon electronic transmission of them (for the purposes of s 36 of the Act) (175 FLR at 4 [11]-[13]). 14 Relevantly, each of the SMS licences dated 1 January 2005 is in identical terms, except for the fees payable under Schedule 1, the identity of the licensors and an extra clause in the AMCOS version regulating reproduction of musical works (cl 5). Each SMS licence commenced on 1 October 2004 (cl 3). APRA was entitled to a fee for monophonic or polyphonic format ringtones of 1.1% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 1.65cents (inclusive of GST) per sale. The fee for phonographic format (i.e. MP3) ringtones was 2.2% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of $3.30 per sale. At all times, Monster charged consumers, according to its advertisements $3.50 per ringtone downloaded via an SMS service. 15 AMCOS was entitled to a fixation fee of $11 in respect of each new AMCOS work added to the licensee's inventory in the quarter for which the fees were payable. In addition, the licensee had to pay AMCOS a fee for each ringtone of 11% inclusive of GST of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 16.5cents (inclusive of GST) per sale. 149 I am of opinion that no such order should be made. Monster has committed serious breaches of the IVR and SMS licences in the past. I do not think that it is appropriate to force APRA and AMCOS into a contractual relationship in the circumstances. I am not satisfied that they would not negotiate the granting of new licences to Monster in good faith. If Monster cannot obtain in such negotiations new licences from APRA, the Copyright Tribunal has power to settle their terms. That power may also extend to the AMCOS licences in circumstances such as the present: Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR at 8-9 [26]-[31] per Lindgren P. 150 Monster was unlicensed from 18 August 2005 in respect of IVR services and from 13 December in respect of SMS services. It is liable to APRA and AMCOS for damages for infringement. APRA and AMCOS exercised their election to claim damages rather than an account of profits. It is agreed that the appropriate sum by which compensatory damages should be fixed is what would have been payable under the licences had Monster been licensed. That is a reasonable approach and I will adopt it. 151 Mr Mallett identified four licensees of ringtones from APRA and AMCOS which he said were comparable to the business operated by Monster. The trading names of the licensees were Jamster, Bugal, Blue Sky Frog and Powercom. He concluded that the proportions of ringtone downloads of all downloads in each of those competitors' businesses over the periods he examined were between 40.94% and 66.17%. This was based on the amount of licence fees paid to APRA and AMCOS by each of those licensees during the relevant licence periods. Mr Mallett estimated, based on his comparison with the four competitors, about 41.31% of Monster's revenue over its period of trading was attributable to ringtone services. This led to a claim that total licence fees due to 30 June 2006 were $1 million of which only about $315,000 had been paid."

Case7273,cited,NBCI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 280,"the power to dismiss an appeal for want of prosecution is a power available to be exercised in an appropriate case.

This power can be invoked in respect to all appeals, including bankruptcy appeals: e.g. Singh v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2008] FCA 544. In the present appeal there is a legitimate basis upon which the application is being advanced by the Respondent. Left to one side when considering the merits of the present application to dismiss for want of prosecution have been such factors as the commencement by the present Appellant of a District Court proceeding. That proceeding was commenced subsequent to the service of the petition. Its procedural course was the subject of criticism by the Federal Magistrates Court. Such factors have been left to one side, as the "" want of prosecution "" to which O 52 r 38(1)(a) is directed is a want of prosecution of the "" appeal ""; defaults or procedural irregularities in other proceedings may appear to assume little (if any) immediate relevance when that provision is invoked. In the present appeal, the Appellant failed to file an index to the Appeal Book , to prepare an Appeal Book or to file submissions as directed. After the Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court on 19 January 2009, the Appellant took no step &#8212; or certainly undertook inadequate steps &#8212; prior to 17 April and 5 May 2009 to ensure that her appeal would be ready for hearing.

Case11921,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Econovite Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 964,"I will revert to this matter specifically when dealing with the proposed pecuniary penalty, I should emphasise at the outset, and the parties themselves acknowledge, that the Court retains the responsibility for imposing penalties and for making orders, the parties' agreement notwithstanding.

As is clear from such cases as NT Power 219 CLR (particularly at 116) and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd (2007) 237 ALR 512 (particularly at 526-527), this condition is strictly applied. 158 Section 46(1)(c) must be read in the context of the policy objective sought to be achieved by the TPA. As pointed out by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway 205 CLR at 13). ""Section 46 aims to promote competition, not the private interests of particular persons or corporations."" (cf Boral 215 CLR 373 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at 411, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 429, McHugh J at 458-459; Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Baxter Healthcare 237 ALR at 535, Rural Press [2002] FCAFC 213 at [139] , Universal Music 131 FCR at 585, and the discussion of Professor Corones at pp 34-37). It follows that the conduct of a person which the corporation or other entity with the substantial degree of market power seeks to affect must be conduct in the nature of competition in a market. Like s 46(1)(a), the breadth of application of s 46(1)(c) is such that it does not need to be the market in which the respondent is a participant (cf Merkel J in Robert Hicks Pty Ltd (t/as Auto Fashions Australia) v Melway Publishing Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 627 at 643, Toohey J in Ross Payne &amp; Co v Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board unreported, Federal Court of Australia, 3 August 1983, Wilcox J in Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd v ASX Operations Pty Ltd (1990) 93 ALR 523 at 555). Accordingly, it is within the scope of s 46(1)(c) that a corporation or entity with a substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market could breach s 46(1)(c) because, inter alia , its purpose was to deter or prevent the a person from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market. 160 First, while I accept that, as a result of the respondent's proposal, the applicant will not be able to continue to provide services to its customers which include the Excluded Data, and that this may impact upon the business of the applicant as claimed in para 9(b) of the amended statement of claim, the applicant must demonstrate more than this effect to show that the purpose of the respondent's conduct was in breach of s 46(1)(c). As pointed out by Lee J in NT Power Generation v Power &amp; Water Authority [2002] FCAFC 302 at [17] , although the effect of conduct may, in some circumstances, explain or reveal the purpose of the conduct, the inference may be negated by other material relevant to the issue of purpose (cf Photo-Continental Pty Ltd v Sony (Australia) Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-372 at 40,122-40,123). It is the purposeful conduct of the contravening corporation that attracts the operation of s 46(1)(c): Baxter Healthcare 237 ALR at 519."

Case8061,referred to,Re Club Superstores Australia Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (1993) 10 ACSR 730,"In the afternoon of 29 April 2005, Mr Spalla had asked Mr Rambaldi not to come to an agreement with the respondents without first consulting him. At no time that day, did Mr Rambaldi conclude an agreement with the respondents. Mr Spalla was notified of the respondents' offer at the close of business that day. At that point, he had seven days in which to satisfy Mr Rambaldi that Irlmond, with Mr Rambaldi as liquidator, should continue to pursue the primary proceeding and the appeals, alternatively, to make some other arrangement that would permit Irlmond to litigate its claims, though without Mr Rambaldi. It is true that it was not for Mr Spalla to decide whether to continue with or terminate Irlmond's participation in the primary proceeding. This decision was left with Mr Rambaldi, who might or might not act to secure his partners' consent. This was, however, in keeping with the LFA and the duty of a liquidator to act independently, in the best interests of the company and its creditors: compare Re Club Superstores Australia Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (1993) 10 ACSR 730 at 734-735 per Thomas J (and the cases there cited); Re Allebart Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) and the Companies Act [1971] 1 NSWLR 25 at 28 per Street J; and AR Keay, McPherson The Law of Company Liquidation (4 th ed, LBC information Services, 1999) at 291.

Case3790,referred to,Kucks v CSR Limited (1996) 66 IR 182 ,"The Court's adoption of a ""purposive"" approach to the interpretation of statutory instruments, awards and certified agreements has been explained by various courts: Vision Super Pty Ltd v Poulter [2006] FCA 849 ; (2006) 154 FCR 185 at [66] [69]; Ansett Australia Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v Australian Licenced Aircraft Engineers Association [2003] FCAFC 209 at [8] ; Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd (1998) 80 IR 208 at 212 and Hawkins v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (No 2) (1996) 70 IR 213 at 218. In Kucks v CSR Limited (1996) 66 IR 182 at 184, Madgwick J put the point in the following terms: ""It is trite that narrow or pedantic approaches to the interpretation of an award are misplaced. The search is for the meaning intended by the framer(s) of the document, bearing in mind that such framer(s) were likely of a practical bent of mind: they may well have been more concerned with expressing an intention in ways likely to have been understood in the context of the relevant industry and industrial relations environment than with legal niceties or jargon. Thus, for example, it is justifiable to read the award to give effect to its evident purposes, having regard to such context, despite mere inconsistencies or infelicities of expression which might tend to some other reading. And meanings which avoid inconvenience or injustice may reasonably be strained for. For reasons such as these, expressions which have been held in the case of other instruments to have been used to mean particular things may sensibly and properly be held to mean something else in the document at hand. But the task remains one of interpreting a document produced by another or others. A court is not free to give effect to some anteriorly derived notion of what would be fair or just, regardless of what has been written into the award. Deciding what an existing award means is a process quite different from deciding, as an arbitral body does, what might fairly be put into an award. So, for example, ordinary or well-understood words are in general to be accorded their ordinary or usual meaning."""
Case9288,considered,McKenzie v South Australia [2005] FCA 22 ; (2005) 214 ALR 214,"test to be applied on an application under s 84C(1) of the NTA is clear. Finn J stated the relevant principles in McKenzie v South Australia [2005] FCA 22 ; (2005) 214 ALR 214 ("" McKenzie "") at 221 [26]: Beyond this provision [that is, s 84C(1)] this court retains its power of summary dismissal under O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules . It is now well accepted that applications under s 84C(1) should be approached in the same cautious way as applications under O 20 r 2: see Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226...at [51] [52]. The court's powers should be exercised only where the claim as expressed is untenable and upon the version of the evidence favourable to the respondents to the strike out: Landers v South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at [7] . A clear case has to be made out: Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178...at [48] [49]. Nonetheless, it may require extensive argument and may be necessary to adduce evidence to establish the futility of a case: General Steel Industries Inc v Commission for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130; Bodney v Bropho at [51] [52]. A native title determination application does not comply with s 61 of the NTA if it is clearly established that it is not made by a native title claim group. A native title claim group is a group consisting of all the persons who, according to their traditional laws and customs, had the common or group rights or interests comprising the particular native title claimed. These propositions follow from the provisions of ss 61(1) and (4), 251B and 253 of the NTA and have been stated in the cases: Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] - [61] per O'Loughlin J; Tilmouth v Northern Territory of Australia [2001] FCA 820 ; (2001) 109 FCR 240 ("" Tilmouth "") at 241-242 [4] per O'Loughlin J; Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 ("" Landers "") at 504 [33] per Mansfield J; Dieri People v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 187 ; (2003) 127 FCR 364 ("" Dieri People "") at 377-378 [55]-[56] per Mansfield J; McKenzie at 223 [41] per Finn J; Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ("" Hillig "") at [60] per Bennett J; Harrington-Smith (on behalf of the Wongatha People) v Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31 ; (2007) 238 ALR 1 at 230-232 [1206] - [1217] per Lindgren J; Reid v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1479 ("" Reid "") at [27] per Finn J; Kite v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1662 ("" Kite "") at [21]-[22] per Finn J. The propositions have been applied most commonly in circumstances where it is clear that the claimant group is a sub-group or sub-set or part of a native title claim group. Cases such as Tilmouth , Landers , Dieri People , McKenzie and Reid are all cases in which it was clear that the claim group was not a native title claim group. The cases also make it clear that caution needs to be exercised before concluding on a strike-out application that a claim group is a sub-group, sub-set or part of a native title claim group: Colbung v The State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 774 at [23] - [26] per Finn J; McKenzie at 223 [41] per Finn J; Hillig at [60] per Bennett J; Reid at [28] per Finn J; and Kite at [22] per Finn J. For example, it may be that a sub-group of a community sharing traditional laws and customs alone possesses rights and interests in a particular area and that sub-group may itself constitute a native title claim group: Hillig at [60] per Bennett J (see also the obiter observations of Wilcox J in Bodney v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 890 at [41] ; Perry M and Lloyd S, Australian Native Title Law (Lawbook Co, 2003) [3.130]."
Case488,applied,Evans Deakin Proprietary Limited v Sebel Furniture Limited [2003] FCA 171,"helpful and reflective summary of principle in relation to the reception of expert evidence having regard to the Uniform Evidence Act (of which the Evidence Act is an exemplar), is to be found in the judgment of Allsop J, as his Honour then was, in Evans Deakin Proprietary Limited v Sebel Furniture Limited [2003] FCA 171 at [670] . His Honour there observed: Central to the orderly and admissible presentation of any expert evidence is the clear identification of the opinions that the expert seeks to present. This is a separate question from whether, for the opinions of the expert to be admissible, the basis of the opinions on the assumed facts must be set out, about which there may be different views expressed in Makita and Quick v Stoland . I think, however, any such difference is unlikely, in most cases, to be of significance in the light, in particular, of s 135 of the Evidence Act and its likely application to disembodied and unsubstantiated expressions of opinion, a matter to which reference was made in Quick v Stoland . If I may say so, without intending to put to one side the comprehensive reasons of Heydon JA in Makita or the careful reasons of the Judges in Quick v Stoland, in this case I particularly bear in mind what Gleeson CJ said in HG v The Queen at 727: ""The opinions of Mr McCombie were never expressed in admissible form."" And then his Honour emphasised this: An expert whose opinion is sought to be tendered should differentiate between the assumed facts upon which the opinion is based, and the opinion in question. Then a little later: Argument in this Court proceeded on the basis that it was possible to identify from Mr McCombie's written report some facts which he either observed or accepted, and which could be distinguished from his expressions of expert opinion. Then again Allsop J emphasised this in Gleeson CJ's reasons in HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2 at [39] : Even so, the provisions of section 79 will often have the practical effect of emphasising the need for attention to requirements of form. By directing attention to whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience, the section requires that the opinion is presented in a form which makes it possible to answer that question. This particular passage goes to the second basis upon which objection is taken to Mr Tait's opinion, which is that it is non-compliant with the requirements of the exception to the opinion rule, found in s 79 of the Evidence Act . Though initially, on the face of the report itself, I was apprehensive as to whether Mr Tait had exposed any particular expertise in relation to fish ecology and biology as applied to lungfish, I am satisfied, having regard to his supplementation of his experience in the affidavit filed this morning by leave, that he does have experience in relation to the ecology and management issues associated with the passage of freshwater fish, including lungfish, over barriers. The difficulty is that his report, as I have observed, ranges much more widely than the issues on the pleadings. Further, insofar as section 4 in particular of the report is concerned, that appears to be but a mere collation, as opposed to, overtly, the views of someone experienced with lungfish enlarging upon, by reference to his own specialised knowledge, the views of others which he regards as correct and appropriately included by way of highlighting particular qualities of the lungfish. There is also the vice elsewhere evident in the report, insofar as it may be relevant, of not making plain what is fact and what is opinion."
Case16532,discussed,Payne v Young [1979] HCA 39 ; (1980) 145 CLR 609,"In Payne v Young [1979] HCA 39 ; (1980) 145 CLR 609 the High Court considered its analogical rule which, as Barwick CJ emphasized (145 CLR at 614) spoke of ' ... plaintiffs in whom any right to relief is alleged to exist'. The operation of O 6 r 2(a)(ii) is different and less liberal for it requires ' all the rights to relief ' to be in respect of or to arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions. 46 Here the rights to relief claimed by the Bank against Ms Nader are legally and factually independent of the claims by the Bank against the guarantors other than Marie and Josephine Saklaoui for the purposes of O 6 r 2(a) because none of the other guarantors participated in the transactions between each of Marie and Josephine Saklaoui, Ms Nader and the Bank. As Mason J said in Payne v Young [1979] HCA 39 ; (1980) 145 CLR 609 at 618 (see too per Barwick CJ at 614-615, Stephen J at 615 and Aickin J, whose decision at first instance was affirmed, at 611) of the amendment to the English rules in 1898: 'The object of the amendment was to allow several plaintiffs to join separate causes of action where under the old rule as interpreted by judicial decision they could not do so. Subject to the two limitations expressed in pars. (a) and (b) of the rule, it permits the joinder of separate causes of action which have accrued to different plaintiffs. The effect of the rule was, in my opinion, correctly stated by Vaughan Williams L.J. in Stroud v Lawson when he said ([1898] 2 QB at pp 54-55): ""I do not think that the rule means that the whole of a transaction must be involved in each of the causes of action joined. I think that, if there was a transaction or series of transactions in respect of which one plaintiff was interested up to a certain point, and other plaintiffs were interested, not only up to that point, but in respect of the entire transaction or series of transactions from beginning to end, under this rule they might joint their separate causes of action in one action, because there would be one transaction or series of transactions in respect of which the various plaintiffs all claimed a right to relief. Their remedies or damages might be different, but they would be claiming relief in respect of the same transaction or series of transactions."" To these observations I would add the comment that the rule may well authorize the joinder of separate causes of action accruing to various plaintiffs against different defendants, so long as the causes of action arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions. The consequence is that under par. (a) of the rule joinder of separate causes of action accruing to different plaintiffs is authorized when the relief claimed is in respect of, or arises out of, the same or a particular series of transactions. Joinder is not authorized when the relief claimed is in respect of, or arises out of, two or more different series of transactions, when the participation of each individual plaintiff is limited to participation in one series of transactions, the other plaintiffs not participating in that series.' 50 The Bank argued that the requisite commonality was to be found in the fact that it sued all guarantors on a common debt which they jointly guaranteed or in which they were concerned and that this distinguished its case from Payne v Young [1979] HCA 39 ; (1980) 145 CLR 609. 51 But here, the Bank's claim against each guarantor and, in particular, against each of Marie and Josephine Saklaoui, depended on its having entered into relationships based in contract and in interests in land ( viz : its mortgages). That is, the Bank relies on the reality and validity of those dealings as its primary case. Next, the Bank has now been given leave to amend to allege against, inter alios , Marie and Josephine Saklaoui, that each was guilty of fraud in proffering her guarantee, mortgage and signature of the certificate when, on this alternative, there will be no real or valid guarantee or mortgage. 52 Obviously, the two above ways of the Bank putting its case against the guarantors are distinct and involve different transactions or series of transactions. This not just because of the legal distinction between a claim under a valid and binding guarantee and or mortgage, and a claim that the Bank was the victim of a fraud because those instruments have been avoided or were void ab initio . It is also because there are six different guarantors, each with his or her own circumstances and, in substance, cases within the overall context of the Bank proceedings."
Case12696,followed,SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) FCA 724,"have reached this conclusion for the following reasons. Nowhere in the Tribunal's reasons for finding that the proposed visit to Australia by the visa applicant was not genuine does the Tribunal directly address and consider the stated reason given by the visa applicant (and the appellant) for the visit, namely that the visa applicant wished to travel to visit Australia to visit his mother . The evidence before the Tribunal was that the visa applicant is approximately 20 years old, and has not seen his parents since he was 16 years old. It does not require a leap of imagination to infer that, in view of the visa applicant's relative youth and the time which has passed since the relevant parties last met, it is natural that the visa applicant would wish to travel to Australia to visit his parents. To the extent relevant, given that his mother successfully applied for asylum in Australia, an inference could be drawn that it is not practical for the visa applicant's parents to travel to Pakistan to see the visa applicant. However the Tribunal does not deal specifically with this claimed motive of the visa applicant and explain why, in respect of this visa applicant, the Tribunal disbelieved that the reason given was not genuine. While reasons for a decision under review are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error ( Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic [1993] FCA 456 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272; SZCOQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCAFC 9 at [14] , [27]) nonetheless the claimed reason of the visa applicant to visit Australia is clearly a relevant consideration, acceptance or rejection of which goes to the core of his application and the ""genuineness"" of the proposed visit. During the hearing I asked Counsel for the Minister to identify in the decision of the Tribunal where the Tribunal specifically considered the claimed reason of the visa applicant to visit Australia but rejected that claim. Counsel referred me to the following statements by the Tribunal: ""The stated purpose of the visa applicant's travel to Australia is to visit his mother and father for two to three months."" (p 26 para 81) (TS p 13 ll 6-7); ""The tribunal acknowledges that there are significant family business and religious reasons for the visa applicant to return. However these reasons can be overcome by the visa applicant if he is successful in obtaining a protection visa. ... If the tribunal is thus not satisfied that the above reasons are strong enough to outweigh the likelihood because of the risk he faces daily..."" (p 27 paras 92-93) (TS p 13 ll 33-41). In my view these statements do not demonstrate any consideration of the visa applicant's claimed reason for wishing to visit Australia. Indeed, the statement at p 27 paras 92-93 of the Tribunal's reasons for decision actually relates to a different issue, namely reasons why the visa applicant may wish to return to Pakistan . Counsel for the Minister also directed my attention to the statement by the Tribunal that the visa applicant is required to satisfy subcl 679.211 of the Regulations (TS p 12 ll 6-45, p 13 ll 1-7). Subclause 679.211 provides that one of the criteria that a visa applicant must satisfy is as follows: 679.211 The applicant seeks to visit Australia: (a) for the purpose of visiting an Australian citizen, or Australian permanent resident, who is a parent, spouse, de facto partner, child, brother or sister of the applicant; or (b) for a purpose other than a purpose related to business or medical treatment. The Minister conceded in submissions (TS p 17 ll 1-2) that the visa applicant had satisfied this criterion. Counsel submitted that this meant that the Tribunal had considered the personal circumstances of the visa applicant, and his wish to visit his mother, for the purposes of subcl 679.224. However because the Tribunal did not specifically discuss subcl 679.211 and the manner of the visa applicant's apparent satisfaction of that criterion, it is difficult to draw any conclusions in relation to this issue from the reasons of the Tribunal. Did the apparent satisfaction of subcl 679.211 simply require an unsupported statement by the visa applicant (which may or may not be genuine) that his or her purpose in visiting Australia falls within subcl 679.211(a) or (b)? (This is consistent with the language of subcl 679.211, namely that the visa applicant ""seeks to visit Australia"" for nominated purposes.) Or, because the Tribunal specifically did not discuss subcl 679.211 in its application to the visa applicant, does it follow that: the Tribunal impliedly accepted that the visa applicant's purpose in visiting Australia was as contemplated by subcl 679.211(a) or (b); but that because the Tribunal subsequently found against the visa applicant pursuant to subcl 679.224 without making further reference to the visa applicant's stated purpose, the Tribunal had impliedly found that a more compelling reason for the visa applicant's visit was to seek asylum? In my view not only is such a process of reasoning tortured, it is not supported by the language of subcl 679.211 (which does not appear to require anything more than a statement of a purpose by the visa applicant), and it potentially gives rise to a denial of procedural fairness. Indeed the Minister conceded that, in determining whether the visa applicant had satisfied the criterion in subcl 679.224, the genuineness of the wishes of the visa applicant required separate consideration of the stated purpose of the visa applicant in visiting Australia. In the circumstances, in light of the absence of discussion or reasoning by the Tribunal, I cannot draw any inferences with respect to the decision of the Tribunal in relation to subcl 679.224 from the apparent satisfaction of subcl 679.211 by the visa applicant. The submission by the Minister during the appeal before me that the decision of the Tribunal was essentially a credibility finding with respect to the evidence of the visa applicant (TS p 8 ll 32-33) appears inconsistent with the positive view specifically taken by the Tribunal in relation to the credibility of the visa applicant in terms of his character and conduct, namely that the Tribunal was not aware of any false or misleading information or documentation presented in relation to the visa application or any other visa application. If the Tribunal subsequently found that the visa applicant lacked credibility in relation to his stated reason for wishing to visit Australia again, an issue which is at the core of this case the Tribunal should have explained why. Counsel for the Minister also submitted that the findings of the Tribunal as to the genuineness of the visa applicant's visit to Australia involved matters of weight of evidence, which are matters for the Tribunal and not subject to review by this Court. It is clear that findings in respect of the credibility of an applicant are matters for the Tribunal ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at 423) and that the weight given by the Tribunal to material before it, both oral evidence and documentary, is a matter for the Tribunal as an incident of its role as the arbiter of fact ( Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259). However it is also clear that, in accordance with requirements of procedural fairness, in considering whether a claimed visit to Australia is genuine for the purposes of a claim for a visa the Tribunal is obliged to give genuine consideration to a claimed reason to visit. Counsel for the Minister submitted that that, because the Tribunal had stated the claimed purpose of the visa applicant's travel to Australia at p 26 para 81 of the reasons for decision, it followed that the Tribunal had weighed that claim in reaching its decision. However in my view simple statement of an issue is not automatically tantamount to consideration of that issue, and to the extent that Counsel for the Minister relied on that submission I reject it. At the very least, in order to weigh the merit of an issue or of evidence, the issue or evidence must be actually addressed. Generally, the fact that the Tribunal has addressed an issue may be inferred from its reasons, however in this case I am not satisfied that the Tribunal has addressed the visa applicant's claimed reason for visiting Australia based on the statements to which my attention has been directed by Counsel. Procedural fairness requires the tribunal to give real consideration to the claim of the visa applicant and the merits of his case, including his claimed reason for visiting Australia. That failure to do so constitutes a denial of natural justice and a jurisdictional defect infecting the decision of the Tribunal is clear from such cases as Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at 394, 406-407, 408 , Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 367 per Kirby J, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Maltsin [2005] FCAFC 118 at [38] , SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) FCA 724 at [38] - [39] . That the Tribunal did not consider the claimed reason of the visa applicant for visiting Australia, but considered the application before it exclusively in light of the circumstances of the group into which the Tribunal categorised the visa applicant namely Ahmadi Muslims from Pakistan is evident from the conduct of the hearing and the Tribunal's findings. In particular I note the following: the consideration by the Tribunal of the fact that the appellant had claimed to be at risk of persecution because she was an Ahmadi Muslim (at [23]) and that the visa applicant was also an Ahmadi Muslim (at [22]); the fact that, during the proceedings before the Tribunal, the Tribunal asked the appellant ""why her son, as an Ahmadi, would not seek asylum should he come to Australia"" (at [32]); the fact that, during questioning of the visa applicant by telephone, it appears that the Tribunal focussed almost exclusively on the fact that the visa applicant was an Ahmadi Muslim, which suggested that the visa applicant faced persecution in Pakistan. I note in particular paras [50]-[56] of the Tribunal's reasons for decision; the fact that, during questioning of the appellant, the Tribunal focussed extensively on the fact that the visa applicant was an Ahmadi Muslim, which suggested that the visa applicant faced persecution in Pakistan and would seek asylum in Australia. I note in particular paras [32], [59]-[60]; the detailing of independent country information with respect to Ahmadi Muslims in Pakistan over several pages; the finding of the Tribunal that, notwithstanding the claims of the visa applicant that he is not persecuted, because the visa applicant was an Ahmadi Muslim he was at risk of serious harm in Pakistan (at [74], [76], [78]) if not constantly at risk of serious harm (at [86]); the finding of the Tribunal that, notwithstanding the visa applicant's reasons to return to Pakistan, ""because of the risk he faces daily as an Ahmadi in Rabwah or elsewhere in Pakistan should he return"" he would seek to remain permanently in Australia (at [93]). These findings of fact by the Tribunal were clearly relevant to the determination of the visa application by the Tribunal, because, as contemplated by the Ministerial Direction, they relate to conditions in Pakistan which may encourage the visa applicant to remain in Australia. However in the context of the apparent failure by the Tribunal to address any of the personal circumstances of the visa applicant other than his religion including the natural desire of a young person to visit his mother in my view these findings suggest that the Tribunal member considered the application exclusively from the perspective of the visa applicant's religious affiliations and the likelihood that the visa applicant was being persecuted in Pakistan. In my view the Tribunal's reasons do not support a submission that the Tribunal failed to weigh properly issues raised and evidence of the visa applicant (which in itself would not give rise to jurisdictional defect: cf SZLSA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 23 at [11] ) rather the decision indicates that the Tribunal did not weigh the claims or evidence of the visa applicant at all . Finally I note that the Tribunal addressed the visa applicant's immigration history as contemplated by para 8(c) of the Ministerial Direction, and found: ...the visa applicant has told the Tribunal of his travel to India each year, and hence, of his return to Pakistan each year. The Tribunal puts little weight on this return travel as it is to nearby India for religious purposes only; it is not to a free developed country where his parents reside. There has been no previous travel to Australia. (at [79]) In relation to this finding I make the following observations: While findings as to weight of evidence are findings for the Tribunal, the Tribunal's articulation of this issue suggests that the Tribunal's approach to the issue of the visa applicant's immigration history was premised on a wrong question namely ""What is the visa applicant's immigration history with respect to Australia or other free developed countries?"" Clearly para 8(c) of the Ministerial Direction is not so limited. The Tribunal appeared to discount travel to India because it was ""for religious purposes only"". Without further explanation, it is unclear why religious travel should not be relevant to the visa applicant's immigration history in the context of his visa application. Finally, the Tribunal considered return travel to India of little weight because India is not a ""free developed country"" where his parents reside. I note in passing that the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade country information for India dated April 2009 describes the republic of India as ""a constitutional democracy made up of 28 states and seven unions and national territories"" (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, India Country brief April 2009, www.dfat.gov.au/geo/india/india_brief.html) and that further: India is the major power in South Asia and its relations with its neighbours govern the tenor of foreign relations in the region. ... The Indian economy comprises a wide spectrum of activity, ranging from high technology to subsistence agriculture. After decades of failing to realise its full economic potential, India has been one of the world's fastest growing large economies since 1994. Indian economic engagement with the rest of the world has increased, particularly in the services sector... Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain... In light of the fact that it is public knowledge that India is a constitutional democracy and a growing and significant economic power it is somewhat curious that the Tribunal should have dismissed a visit to India by the visa applicant because India is not ""free"" and ""developed"", without elaboration other than the fact that the visa applicant's parents do not reside there. Potentially this approach raises issues beyond weight in this case it is questionable whether the Tribunal gave genuine consideration to the fact that the visa applicant had travelled to another country, which is a relevant consideration for the purposes of this application. In the circumstances however it is unnecessary for me to decide whether the Tribunal's approach to the visa applicant's immigration history is also infected with jurisdictional error. Conclusion"
Case25110,discussed,Griffith University v Tang (2005) 31 CLR 99,"In my view s 66 of the NT Act, for the reasons I have given above, proceeds on the basis that a decision to accept for registration a native title claim under s 190 not only may, but must, be made before competing registered native title claimants in respect of the same claim area are notified of the competing claim. In Griffith University v Tang (2005) 31 CLR 99 Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ at 117-118 referred to there generally being a relationship between the questions of standing and, in the context of procedural fairness, the right to be heard. However, in my view s 66(6)(a) makes it plain that in the normal course a competing registered native title claimant is not entitled to be given the opportunity to be heard when the Registrar is considering whether to accept for registration a native title determination application over the same area of land. The mere fact of having standing to challenge the Registrar's decision does not mean that the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants were entitled to the opportunity to make submissions to the Registrar and to present material to him when he was considering such a decision. 27 However, there are particular features in the present matter which take the position further. The Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants were in fact aware of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, and that the Registrar would in due course consider whether to accept it for registration. The NLC, as the relevant representative body for the area covered by both applications, was entitled to be given a copy of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application and other documents relating to it pursuant to s 66(2A) of the Act. That may be how the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants came to learn of the later application. The NLC had certified the Town of Batchelor No 1 application. The solicitors acting for the NLC were the same solicitors as were acting for the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants. Those solicitors had indicated a desire to make a submission to the Registrar on whether the Town of Batchelor No 2 application should be accepted for registration. There was then an e-mail exchange between the Registrar by his officers and those solicitors on 1 December 2005 in which it was acknowledged that such a submission was to be made, and that such a submission would be made after the proposed amendment to the Town of Batchelor No 2 application. The officer of the Registrar indicated that the time within which the submission should be made and material presented would be notified to the NLC once the amendments had been effected. I accept that, on the evidence, the proposed submission in opposition to the potential registration of the Town of Batchelor No 2 claim was delayed until after the proposed amendment of that claim and that the Registrar gave notification that the Registrar was considering whether to accept for registration the amended Town of Batchelor No 2 application. I also accept, as I have said above, that had such a submission been made it would have raised significant material for the Registrar's consideration relevant to whether the Town of Batchelor No 2 application should have been accepted for registration. 28 It is that combination of particular circumstances which, in my view, gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and an obligation on the part of the Registrar that he would give the NLC and its solicitors notification that he was considering whether to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No 2 application and a time within which to take the opportunity to make submissions and to provide information in relation to it. I am mindful of the fact that relevant communications on 1 December 2005 were between the solicitor for the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and for the NLC on the one hand, and an officer of the Registrar, but referred only to a submission from the NLC. In my view, there was such a coincidence of interest between the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and the NLC in the present circumstances, a coincidence which was apparent to the Registrar from the Town of Batchelor No 1 application having been certified by the NLC, that the opportunity to make a submission and to present additional information was one which was an entitlement to procedural fairness which covered both the NLC and the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants. 29 It is accepted that that opportunity was not provided by the Registrar. 30 In my judgment, therefore, there was a failure to accord procedural fairness to the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants in the particular circumstances before the decision was made by the Registrar to accept the Town of Batchelor No 2 application for registration. The nature of the submission, and additional information, which may have been provided in response to such an opportunity might have affected the outcome of the Registrar's decision. 31 I accordingly propose to set aside the Registrar's decision on that ground. 32 I will briefly refer to the other two grounds upon which the Registrar's decision is attacked."
Case8725,affirmed,"Barrington and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2005] AATA 1050","The Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by the Hon R J Groom, Deputy President, varied a decision of the Secretary refusing an order under s 1184K(1). The Tribunal directed that $60,000 of Mr Barrington's compensation payment be treated as not having been made: Barrington and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2005] AATA 1050. 5 On appeal to this Court the Secretary accepts that the decision of the Tribunal was open on the evidence. However, he submits that in its process the Tribunal made two errors of law: &#8226; It failed to deal with a submission seriously advanced by the Secretary which was worthy of consideration, namely the fact that Mr Barrington's purchase of a house after he had received notice of the lump sum preclusion period told against the recognition of special circumstances; and &#8226; It denied the Secretary natural justice by basing its finding of ""special circumstances"" on the payment of $47,500 legal costs out of the settlement payment of $285,000: 1. without giving the Secretary any notice that it might treat the costs payment as relevant; 2. having discouraged the Secretary from making submissions on that issue; and 3. thereby denying the Secretary the opportunity to make submissions on that issue. 6 Mr Barrington was injured at work in 1999 and received weekly compensation until 12 September 2002. On that day he settled an action for damages for $285,000 inclusive of legal costs. He received the net amount of $237,500 after deduction of legal costs. Mr Barrington said in evidence that he actually paid $55,000 in legal fees. The Tribunal thought it possible that he was required to pay a further $7,500 out of the net amount, but was satisfied he paid at least $47,500."
Case24097,distinguished,Somerset v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCA 1399,"The applicant cited Somerset v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCA 1399 as authority for the proposition that failure to diagnose may not necessarily constitute an inability to obtain appropriate clinical management. However, in Somerset Greenwood J plainly left open the possibility that it may do so; see [36]. Somerset is distinguishable on the grounds that, in that case, there was no basis for believing that the veteran was suffering from the disease during his period of service. In contrast, the expert opinion of Dr Waring is that there was adequate evidence that Mr Money had IFA ""at least as early as 30 April 1979"". As indicated above at [27], Dr Musk was inclined to a similar view. In Repatriation Commission v Wedekind [2000] FCA 649 , Kenny J was prepared at [17] to assume, without deciding, that the Tribunal may reasonably have been satisfied that diagnostic failure could lead to an inability to obtain appropriate clinical management. Given that a beneficial approach is called for in dealing with this legislation ( Brew v Repatriation Commission [1999] FCA 1246 ; (1999) 94 FCR 80) , it seems to me that a person in Mr Money's position may well be prevented from obtaining appropriate clinical management of a condition by lack of awareness that they suffer from it."
Case12906,cited,Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (1984) 58 ALR 305,"The other basis upon which the learned Magistrate rejected the application was that there would be prejudice to public administration. His Honour relied on well known remarks of Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (1984) 58 ALR 305, at 310 and following. Wilcox J, speaking of extensions of time generally and comparing the situation of public administration with that where merely private rights are involved, said (at 312): 'By contrast, in cases involving public administration, especially day-to-day matters such as personnel management, the public interest may well dictate refusal of an extension, even after only a short delay. ... An applicant concerned to challenge a decision which has implications for other people or for day-to-day public administration may properly be regarded as being under a heavier duty to act expeditiously than is an applicant who is aware that his case has no such implications.' 14 The case for the respondent was that the APSC is: 'only a relatively small agency and the reinstatement of Mr Twining would impact on its administration'. Evidence accepted by his Honour showed that the APSC's current financial year budget provided for a reduction in staff numbers which would continue for at least another three financial years, that at the time the hearing before his Honour there was only one vacancy at the APS 3/4 level (the level at which the appellant had been engaged), and other matters. His Honour accepted the submission that: 'There was no regular staff turnover such as expected in larger organisations. Although reinstatement of Mr Twining would not be an impossibility it would be difficult and a burden. An adjustment would need to be made to [the respondent's] budget and programs offered by [the respondent, I gather to persons in the Australian Public Service Commission] could be affected.' 15 Speaking for myself, I would not have attached the same weight to those matters as did his Honour. However, I am unable to say that for him to have taken that view lay outside the scope of the sound legal exercise of his discretion. 16 In the course of examination of the matter today, other aspects of prejudice to the respondent emerged. As I observed in the course of argument, to some extent these are co-extensive with questions that might arise in the Court's discretion as to whether a remedy might be granted if, otherwise, purely legal grounds of challenge to the termination decision were made out, and the matters could be more fully debated in that context. However, given the way the matter has proceeded including that, for the benefit of the appellant, I have been prepared to review his Honour's findings about the adequacy of the explanation without seeing the transcript, and have perhaps gone further than one ordinarily would in departing from the findings of a court at first instance which has had the benefit of hearing and seeing highly relevant evidence given I think that the fact that the matters might later be considered, if time were enlarged, does not prevent them being considered on the question of whether time should be enlarged. 17 One of the factors that motivated Mr Jones, the respondent's delegate, to dismiss the appellant was that he had displayed behaviour to other employees which had very much upset them and made working relationships difficult. The material in the appellant's own affidavits shows that at a time in early 2005 when, albeit in ignorance, he believed that he had no firm legal basis for obtaining a remedy in the courts, he had quite gratuitously, and offensively, abused two officers of the respondent, including the delegate, who were senior to him and quite inappropriately broadcast to other people his offensive and rather unrestrained criticisms of them. The appellant says he was upset, 'out of his mind with worry', about his position at the time. 18 Be that as it may, it is quite clear that it would be irresponsible to put him back in the Programs Group in which he was employed. That means that about 35 to 40 of the 130 positions in the respondent's organisation would not be available to him. The other officer whom he calumniated was the head of the Corporate Group, which comprises another 35 or 40 people. Much less offensive, but quite inappropriate remarks were also directed to the head of the respondent Commission. 19 If time were extended and if the appellant were to succeed, it would be in that environment that his reinstatement on probation for a period of about a month would occur. At the end of that month, if not before, a decision would have to be made about whether overall his conduct and behaviour had been such that he should be taken on permanently. To the extent that there would be difficulty about fitting him in, it would, by reason of his own conduct, be very greatly magnified. Notwithstanding the public interest in decisions affecting the termination of employment of persons in the public sector being regularly and lawfully made, it seems to me that, in the circumstances, there would be likely such a disruption of public administration that the public interest dictates refusal of an extension of time. 20 For these reasons, I consider that the decision of the learned federal Magistrate was correct, even though I would reach it by a slightly different route. 21 Leave to appeal will be granted. The appeal is dismissed with costs I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Madgwick.

I do that because it seems to me that this area of the law is one which is undergoing development. As Allsop P observed, it is not the function of single judges or full or appellate courts to depart from decisions of the High Court. However, in O'Dea v Allstates Leasing Systems (WA) Pty Ltd [1983] HCA 3 ; (1983) 152 CLR 359 the High Court overruled its earlier decision in Lamson Store Service Co Ltd v Russell Wilkins &amp; Sons Ltd [1906] HCA 87 ; (1906) 4 CLR 672.

Case24290,referred to,Gill v Australian Wheat Board [1980] 2 NSWLR 795,"If the Commissioner's contentions in the present proceedings are correct, SRSC may find itself in the position of having to pay income tax on a damages award already reduced to take account of its notional income tax liability. Perhaps more significantly, this Court would have reached a conclusion inconsistent with that reached by the Supreme Court in a judgment that has not been the subject of an appeal. Courts have adverted to this problem on other occasions and suggested that it should be open to join the Commissioner as a party in proceedings in which damages are to be assessed: Gill v Australian Wheat Board [1980] 2 NSWLR 795, at 797, per Rogers J; Provan v HCL Real Estate Ltd (1992) 24 ATR 238 , at 247, per Rolfe J.

Case4282,cited,Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No. 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414,"The foundation of Equity's intervention is the exclusive jurisdiction to enforce an obligation of conscience arising out of the demonstrated circumstances ( Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No. 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 per Deane J at 437 and 438. 69 One of the three elements focuses upon whether the confidential information was imparted in circumstances 'importing an obligation of confidence' ( Coco v Clark at p 47) recognising that 'the notion of an obligation of conscience [arises] from the circumstances in or through which the information was communicated or obtained' ( Moorgate Tobacco v Philip Morris at p 438). The relief 'depends on the broad principle of equity that he who has received information in confidence shall not take unfair advantage of it' ( Seager v Copydex per Lord Denning at p 368). 90 In seeking the court's intervention to restrain use of confidential information it is essential that the applicant demonstrate with precision the information said to be confidential and the content of use sought to be attached. Assertions of confidentiality at high levels of abstraction will not establish a basis for relief against a disclosee. In the case of an innocent third party who simply seeks reliance upon a contract struck without notice of a relationship of confidentiality between the primary disclosor and any other party or breach, the requirement for precision is even more acute. The starting point is the identification of the relevant confidential information ( Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No. 2) (supra) per Deane J at 438; Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collector of Customs (Vic) &amp; Anor (1987) 14 FCR 434 per Gummow J at 443; O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 per Mason J at pp 326 328; Liberty Financial Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Scott &amp; Anor (No. 4) [2005] VSC 26 ; (2005) 11 VR 629 per Harper J, [13], [35]; Pioneer Concrete Service Ltd v Galli (1985) VR 675 per Crockett, Murphy &amp; Ormiston JJ at 711)."
Case19661,discussed,National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155,"leading authority dealing with the operation of s 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155. In that case, Bowen CJ, Woodward and Lockhart JJ said (at 162): ""The power conferred on the Court or a judge by s 48 is in terms wholly unfettered. It should be exercised flexibly having regard to the circumstances of the particular case. It would be regrettable and unwise if the Court were to circumscribe the general power conferred by s 48 with inflexible rules or impose inelastic constraints upon its exercise. As the power may be exercised subject to conditions, the Court or a judge is in a position to mould orders under the section to take account of the many and varied circumstances that arise in particular cases. The power conferred by s 48 recognises the national character of this Court. The factors which the Court is entitled to take into account in considering whether one city is more appropriate than another for interlocutory hearings or for the trial itself are numerous. The Court must weigh those factors in each case. Residence of parties and of witnesses, expense to parties, the place where the cause of action arose and the convenience of the Court itself are some of the factors that may be relevant in particular circumstances. The balance of convenience will generally be a relevant consideration, but not necessarily determinative of each case. A party commences a proceeding by filing an application in a particular registry of the Court. If that party or another party wishes to have the proceeding conducted or continued in another place he may apply to the Court for an order under s 48 or O 10, r 1(2)(f) or O 30, r 6 as the case may be. There is no onus of proof in the strict sense to be discharged by the party seeking to conduct or continue the proceedings elsewhere. It should be noted that the Court may exercise its powers under O 30, r 6 either on the application of a party or of its own motion. The Court must, however, be satisfied, after considering all relevant matters, that there is sound reason to direct that the proceeding be conducted or continued elsewhere. Its starting point is that the proceeding has been commenced at a particular place. Why should it be changed? On the one hand, if the party who commenced the proceeding chose that place capriciously the Court would be justified in giving no weight to the choice of place. At the other end of the scale, a proceeding may have continued for some time at the place of commencement with many steps having been taken there, for example, filing of pleadings and affidavits, discovery and inspection. Due weight would be given by the Court to such matters before directing that the proceeding should continue at a different place. The balance of convenience is important, but its weight must vary from case to case. Ultimately the test is: where can the case be conducted or continued most suitably bearing in mind the interests of all the parties, the ends of justice in the determination of the issues between them, and the most efficient administration of the Court. It cannot and should not, in our opinion, be defined more closely or precisely."""

A factor might be so insignificant that the failure to take it into account could not have materially affected the decision. More recently, a Full Court of this Court in Martincevic v Commonwealth (2007) 164 FCR 45 observed (at [68]) that: It is not for the court to guess what view [the decision-maker] would have taken of the report and its significance.

Case4403,cited,"Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437","The Federal Magistrate made a legal, factual and jurisdictional error in not applying the principles laid down by the full court of Federal Court in Randhawa v The Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437. [sic] 4 The submission was made on behalf of the Minister that the grounds in the notice of appeal are each without any particularisation whatsoever. That is true, but it does not seem to me that it would be a fair way to dispose of the appeal just to regard the grounds as so general as to not admit of a comprehensible challenge to the Magistrate's decision. 5 The Minister also approached the task of responding to the appeal in this way. In particular, regard was had to the way in which the Appellant had developed his case before the Federal Magistrates Court. That seems to me to be a very proper stance to take in the circumstances. In that regard, I also take into account the oral submissions which the Appellant made with dignity and succinctness. It was quite apparent from those, that like many persons without formal legal training, he found difficulty in distinguishing between the fact finding role consigned to the Tribunal, the judicial review role consigned to the Federal Magistrates Court, and the role which this Court has in deciding whether a Magistrate erred in law. 6 When one reads ground 2 of the notice of appeal, in conjunction with the case as developed before the Federal Magistrate, it becomes apparent that the particular concern which the Appellant has is that the Federal Magistrate ought to have held that the Tribunal breached s 424A of the Migration Act . In other words, his complaint about a denial of procedural fairness focuses upon whether the Tribunal ought to have put to him in writing for comment particular ""information."" It is to be remembered that s 422B of the Migration Act provides that the provisions which follow give the relevant procedural fairness content to the obligations which fall on the Tribunal. 13 Ground 4 in the notice of appeal seeks to find error on the part of the Magistrate in not in turn finding error on the part of the Tribunal in applying the principles laid down by a Full Court of this Court in Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437. Though not stated in so many words, I take it, as did the Minister in his submissions, that this is a reference to what might, perhaps inelegantly, be described as the ""relocation"" principle in refugee law. 14 After Randhawa , the High Court had occasion to consider that particular principle last year in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 40 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1659. At pages 1664 and 1665, para 26, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ observed in their joint judgment: in particular cases, territorial distinctions may have an apparent connection with the particular reason for the asserted well founded fear of persecution. There may be instances where differential treatment in matters of, for example, race or religion, is encountered in various parts of one nation state so that in some parts there is insufficient basis for a well founded fear of persecution. However, in other cases the conduct or attribute of the individual which attracts the apprehended persecution may be insusceptible of a differential assessment based upon matters of regional geography."

Case7915,cited,"Re United Medical Protection (No 4) (2002) 20 ACLC 1,647","There are a number of principles relevant to the exercise of the Court's power under s 477(2B) which are worth restating: (1) the court does not simply ""rubber stamp"" whatever is put forward by a liquidator. As Giles J said in Re Spedley Securities Ltd (In liq) (1992) 10 ACLC 1,742 at 1,745 in relation to the powers of a liquidator to compromise claims: ""[T]he Court is necessarily confined in attempting to second guess the liquidator in the exercise of his powers, and generally will not interfere unless there can be seen to be some lack of good faith, some error in law or principle, or real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the liquidator's conduct. The same restraint must apply when the question is whether the liquidator should be authorised to enter into a particular transaction the benefits and burdens of which require assessment on a commercial basis. Of course, the compromise of claims will involve assessment on a legal basis, and a liquidator will be expected (as was made plain in Re Chase Corporation (Australia) Equities Ltd ) to obtain advice and, as a prudent person would in the conduct of his own affairs, advice from practitioners appropriate to the nature and value of the claims. But in all but the simplest case, and demonstrably in the present case, commercial considerations play a significant part in whether a compromise will be for the benefit of creditors."" (2) a court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear: Re United Medical Protection (No 4) (2002) 20 ACLC 1,647; (3) the role of the Court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal. Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which might seem preferable: Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1998) 16 ACLC 1,642; (4) in reviewing the liquidator's proposal, the task of the Court is: ""[not] to reconsider all of the issues which have been weighed up by the liquidator in developing the proposal, and to substitute its determination for his in....a hearing de novo [but]... simply to review the liquidator's proposal, paying due regard to his or her commercial judgment and knowledge of all of the circumstances of the liquidation, satisfying itself there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety, and weighing up whether there is any good reason to intervene in terms of the ""expeditious and beneficial administration"" of the winding up."" See ASC Timber at 1,650; see also Re Gate Gourmet Australia Pty Ltd (in liq) (2005) 23 ACLC 834 at [10] and Warne v GDK Financial Solutions; Peridon Village Nominees [2005] FCAFC 265 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1,019 at [60]. The Court's approval is not an endorsement of the proposed agreement but is merely a permission for the liquidator to exercise his or her own commercial judgment in the matter; (5) further, in judging whether or not a liquidator should be given permission to enter into a funding agreement (whether retrospective or not), it is important to ensure, inter alia, that the entity or person providing the funding is not given a benefit disproportionate to the risk undertaken in light of the funding that is promised or a ""grossly excessive profit"": Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd (2003) 21 ACLC 1,347 at [11] and Re ACN 076 673 875 Ltd (2002) 20 ACLC 1,551 at [28]; (6) generally, the Court grants approval under s 477(2B) of the Act only where the transaction is the proper realisation of the assets of the company or otherwise assists in the winding up of the company: GDK Financial Solutions at [58] and the cases cited therein."
Case8342,cited,Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315,"Of the representations alleged in this category, the first in conversations from 23 December Ms Churchill said words to the effect that everything was going ""all right"" to Mr Hannaford does not warrant serious individual consideration. The pleading is devoid of detail and of context and is quite unilluminating: cf the observations of McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318-319. The submissions have not ameliorated this. 261 The representations alleged to have been made in phone conversations around 4 and 6 January 2004 relating to the China market cannot stand in light of my earlier findings. I have rejected Mr Hannaford's evidence as to the timing of the operative conversations and I have accepted Ms Churchill's evidence as to their substance. They occurred on 3 and 7 January and resulted in Mr Hannaford's agreement to two price reductions. These conclusions necessarily must lead to my rejection of both of these allegations of misleading or deceptive conduct. More significantly, I have found that at the relevant times Ms Churchill did make Mr Hannaford aware of the market conditions in the China market. 262 The final representation of this category was that after 6 January 2004 Ms Churchill had regular telephone conversations with Mr Hannaford but did not advise him of any difficulties with selling TVO cherries in the Hong Kong market save for saying there were allegedly problems with the quality of cherries in one shipment. An allegation so broadly cast is not only unsatisfactory, it is contradicted by a body of evidence. I will not reiterate that evidence here other than to note that I have found that on 7 January, Ms Churchill communicated the substance of Mak's ""serious decline"" email to Mr Hannaford; probably on 7 January he agreed to cancel a shipment; the next morning he suggested a price reduction to which Mak agreed on 9 January; on 9 January two separate quality complaints were made by Mak, these being the first such complaint made by Mak; and notwithstanding the above, Mr Hannaford agreed to Farmlink's ""Mud Map"" of 10 January proposing four air freight shipments to Hong Kong. Whatever might be said from this time onwards about the adequacy or otherwise of Ms Churchill's investigation of the quality complaints made, the burden of the complaint that she did not advise of any difficulties with selling in the Hong Kong market is not made out."

In Campbell v Bogar (unreported, Full Court of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Ryan, Moore and North JJ, 3 July 1996), the Court referred to what is in effect the current r 5.5 of the Union's rules, which was then numbered as r 3(7). The Court's examination of this rule was in the context of transitional rules that were designed to facilitate the amalgamation of earlier registered organisations to become the Union. At issue was the question whether the office of Federal Secretary, Food and Confectionery Division, was a full-time office. The Court's examination of r 3(7) was in the context of determining this question. In the course of setting out its reasoning as to the relationship between provisions of a transitional rule and provisions that were of more permanent duration, the Court said: ""the combined effect of r 3(7) [and other provisions of rule 3] is to prohibit a person nominating for the office of both Regional Secretary and Assistant National Secretary Food and Confectionery Division."" This was simply a statement of the effect of r 3(7), in conjunction with other provisions of the Union's rules. The Court did not deal at all with the consequences of a person nominating for more than one office, in contravention of r 3(7)."
Case21583,cited,Walters v Babergh District Council (1983) 82 LGR (Eng) 235 (QBD),"In Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee [1999] HCA 59 ; (1999) 200 CLR 1, the High Court held unanimously that the word 'liabilities' in s 14 of the Stevedoring Industry Acts (Termination) Act 1977 (Cth), which provided for a vesting in the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee of liabilities of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, operated to vest in the Committee the liability of the Authority in respect of a breach of its duty of care to safeguard wharf labourers against exposure to asbestos fibres, even though the injury was suffered after the vesting under s 14 took place.

Case10016,cited,Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273,"In determining the subsistence of copyright, it is necessary to consider works such as anthologies and compilations as a whole ( Desktop at [99], [152] and [160] per Lindgren J; Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273). In Ladbroke , for example, an argument that copyright attached to individual components of the compilation was rejected by the House of Lords (276-7 per Lord Reid, 284 per Lord Evershed, 285 per Lord Hodson and 291 per Lord Pearce). The relevant compilation was a fixed odds football betting coupon, issued weekly. Their Lordships said that the whole coupon, there considered in the context of a consideration of the originality of the compilation, was to be treated as a single compilation. 45 As noted, s 32 of the Act provides for the subsistence of copyright in original literary works. The test of originality is whether the work was not copied, but originated from the putative author ( Desktop at [160] per Lindgren J). Copyright in a factual compilation is infringed where a person reproduces the copyright work or a substantial part of that work. In this context, '[s] ubstantiality is...determined by reference to the originality of that part of the work taken by the alleged infringer ' ( Desktop at [409] per Sackville J). It follows that, while the subsistence of copyright in the Weekly Schedule is accepted, an understanding of the nature and extent of Nine's skill and labour of authorship of the Weekly Schedule is fundamental to the question of infringement. 46 The extent of an author's contribution to the making of a factual compilation is a question of fact and degree ( Desktop at [160]). In this case, there are two sets of skill and labour exercised by Nine and its employees in the creation of the Weekly Schedule. First, the skill and labour of selecting and arranging the programs to be shown on Nine to attract viewers to programs in the different timeslots and to meet competitors' programs. For the purposes of these proceedings, this is the ""antecedent"" or ""preparatory"" skill and labour in the sense discussed in Ladbroke at 287 8 per Lord Hodson and Desktop at [132] and [160] per Lindgren J, [371] and [409] per Sackville J. Secondly, there is the skill and labour of drafting the synopses, selecting and arranging the additional program information such as classifications and consumer advice and recording, weekly, all of the information into documentary form, the Weekly Schedule. 47 Ice accepts that copyright subsists in the Weekly Schedule by virtue of the skill and labour in the scope of selection of programs, the decision to move or replace existing programs, the adjustment of times, program changes, the mode of expression and in the arrangement of the information by Nine. The work of Mr Healy and Ms Wieland and their colleagues at Nine in preparing each Weekly Schedule is not in dispute. Each Weekly Schedule ""emanates"" from them ( Desktop per Sackville J at [396]). 48 Relatively little information about the preparation and inclusion of synopses by Nine was included in Nine's evidence. Nine devotes skill and labour to producing and preparing synopses for inclusion in the Weekly Schedule. It emerged in cross-examination that Mr Holman, Mr Forrest and occasionally Mr Healy draft synopses for inclusion in the Weekly Schedule. Synopses are also obtained from the producers or publicists for some programs. The synopses are entered into the Nine Database and change each week. They are reviewed by Mr Holman and Ms Wieland before publication of the Weekly Schedule. Ms Wieland may instruct Mr Holman to make amendments to correct typographical or grammatical errors, or to change the description of a program or episode. 51 In Desktop , copyright attached to the compilation by reason of the labour of collecting, verifying, recording and assembling the data and not by reference to the form of the compilation, the alphabetical manner of presentation of the data. The former but not the latter was what originated from the putative author (see, eg Desktop at [438] per Sackville J). In that case, a telephone directory of subscribers in alphabetical order did not permit selection in ordering or expression of the information. Nine submits that, similarly, it is the collocation of information in the Weekly Schedule that is protected. It is the selection of things to be shown in chronological order, as opposed to the order itself, that constitutes the relevant skill and labour to be protected. There must be copying and sufficient resemblance but in such a case, form is not important ( Desktop at [223] per Lindgren J). Nine relies on the fact that copyright protection is medium and technology neutral and that is provided for in the Act (eg, s 21(1A) and s 24). Nine submits that the mere input of material into a database cannot deprive the author of copyright protection. 52 The skill and labour involved in making a factual compilation is likely to vary in each case. As described by Ice, pieces of information are brought together; the selection of that information to the exclusion of other items and the association of pieces of information, one with the other in a line or table creates an intelligible relationship between the pieces of information. The usefulness of the pattern created by the compiler is achieved by the choices that were made and judgment exercised about the individual pieces of information and the relationship between them. There is sufficient skill, judgment and labour in the selection of information and in the mode of expression of the Weekly Schedule, in the presentation of the data after the preparatory work of program selection and arranging is done, to attract copyright protection in that arrangement and presentation. As will become apparent, there is scope for variance in the content of synopses, the selection of additional program information and the overall manner of presentation of the compilation as a whole. The detail of the underlying subject matter, the work in choosing the program for each timeslot is not relevant to the compilation once the ""timetable"" is prepared, much in the same way that the history of the rolling stock of a rail carrier is not relevant to a train timetable. 53 Infringement of a factual compilation is tested by reference to the interest which the copyright is intended to protect ( Desktop at [223] per Lindgren J). In Desktop , that interest was the labour and expense of gathering together in one place the details of all the members of the given universe of all telephone subscribers in a region the skill and labour in collecting, extracting and verifying the data compiled. Although the constituent parts of the resulting compilation of those names in alphabetical order are inevitably arranged in the same way, the compilation was thereby protected. 183 The originality of a compilation may lie in the selection or arrangement of the information. It also may reflect the skill and labour of gathering the facts. As already noted, in the present case, the Weekly Schedule reflects both. It is only the originality of expression that is relevant, not the originality of the idea the subject of the expression ( Donoghue v Allied Newspapers Limited [1938] Ch 106 at 110 per Farwell J). It must be determined whether the part that is taken is an essential or material feature of the whole work, regarded as a copyright work; that is, ' whether the part or parts taken represent a substantial part of the labour, skill and judgment of the author that made the whole work ""original"" ' ( Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378 at [55] per Wilcox and Lindgren JJ). As one should not dissect a work to determine if a part could be protected by copyright standing alone ( Ladbroke at 277 per Lord Reid), so it is inappropriate to dissect the work for the purposes of infringement. The correct approach is to decide whether the work as a whole is protected by copyright and then to determine whether the work or a substantial part of the work as a whole has been taken."
Case10981,cited,Hunt v Railway Commissioners (NSW); Ex parte Brown-Smith [1928] AR (NSW) 151 ,"Another instance may be provided by what was said by Street J in Hunt v Railway Commissioners (NSW); Ex parte Brown-Smith [1928] AR (NSW) 151 at 154 (albeit dealing with a differently framed section): ""and the dismissal must, I think, be a dismissal by an employer really as a matter of victimisation, or the capricious use of his power to dismiss in order, to retaliate upon the employee for his having dared to assert a claim to rights under the award."" In dealing with that section, Evatt J in Grayndler v Cunich [1939] HCA 32 ; (1939) 62 CLR 573 said at 595: ""we are not investigating a case where a business or department is being closed down, but a case where an employer has determined (1) that the enterprise as a whole shall be conducted entirely upon conditions of private bargaining which are less favourable to employees than award conditions, and also (2) that every employee who qualifies himself to obtain the better award conditions shall immediately be dismissed.

Business records can clearly include opinions ( Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd [2003] FCA 933) however as observed by Austin J in ASIC v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417: It is most unlikely that those expressing opinions in business records would attend to the requirements of s 78 or s 79 , let alone with the precision required by Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705. It would not occur to the people creating those documents that they should set out to justify their opinions in the same way that an expert would do in preparing a written report for a court hearing. In those circumstances, to apply the opinion rule to business records that meet the requirements of s 69 would be substantially to undermine, if not to negate, the implementation of the policy underlying the business records provisions, asserted so forcefully by Hope JA in Albrighton (at 548-549) and by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its Interim Report on Evidence at [709]. Courts would be prevented from having access to substantial components of the records of businesses so as to assess them for what they are, on the ground that they do not satisfy requirements which their authors would not have regarded as relevant. As Brownie AJ remarked in a somewhat different context ( Linfox Transport (Aust) Pty Ltd v Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 261 at [23]), ""it does not seem apt in this context to draw a lawyerly distinction between the way a witness might or might not be permitted to give opinion evidence in court with the way in which a company officer routinely reports to his superiors"".

Case21412,considered,Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608,"applicant submits that its definition of ""the Australian market"" is sufficient and not productive of confusion, notwithstanding the later references to a global market for the supply of the same rubber chemicals. It relies on the decision of Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] to support the proposition that a ""global market is a market in Australia if the goods or services are supplied [here]."" In Riverstone , Hill J was dealing with an application for pre-action discovery. All he was called on to determine, on an interlocutory basis, was whether there existed reasonable cause to believe that the applicant had or may have had a right to relief against the respondent. His Honour found that the evidence supported the existence of a global market for new and second hand computers and rejected a submission that, simply because no reference was made in the affidavits relied on by the applicant to an Australian market for these products, no such market existed. His Honour said ([at 21]) that: ""A global market which includes Australia (and the inference is that any global market did) is arguably a market in Australia if sales are made here (and the evidence shows they are) even if that market might also exist in the United States, Japan, China or any other country which was a member of the European union"" (emphasis added). Hill J is not, therefore, to be understood as defining a ""market in Australia"" simply by reference to the fact goods or services which are supplied elsewhere in the world are also supplied in Australia. Riverstone does no more than support a general principle that there may, for TPA purposes, exist a market in Australia even though it forms part of a wider international market. Hill J's decision was so understood by Middleton J in Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35. His Honour considered the meaning of a ""market in Australia"" in the context of s 45 of the TPA. Significantly, his Honour held (at 53) that: ""... the definition of ""market in Australia"" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree...In my opinion, Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 ( Riverstone ) was correct in concluding that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products (or services)""."

Case9654,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507,"Minister submitted in summary, by way of reasons for rejection of the grounds of appeal postulated by the appellants and summarised in [3] above, as follows: (i) the grounds of appeal summarised in [3(1)] and [3(2)] above were meaningless without the particularisation which they lacked; (ii) the grounds of appeal summarised in [3(3)], [3(4)], [3(5)] and [3(9)] above constituted new grounds of appeal not raised by the appellants before Nicholls FM, and should not be allowed in the context of the appeal in the absence of exceptional circumstances being demonstrated; I was referred in that regard to the well known passage in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7-8 (Gibb CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ), where the following appears inter alia : 'In a case where, had the issue been raised in the court below, evidence could have been given which by any possibility could have prevented the point from succeeding, this Court has firmly maintained the principle that the point cannot be taken afterwards... .' The Minister emphasised that the appellants had provided no explanation as to why those new grounds were not raised before Nicholls FM, and moreover that it was not in the interests of other litigants, whose appeals require hearing and determination, and of the broad public interest in efficient judicial administration, to allow those new grounds to be argued and determined, reference being made to five decisions of this Court in relation to migration litigation, the most recent being that of NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) FCR 51 at [162] (Madgwick J); (iii) the grounds summarised in [3(2)], [3(4)], [3(7)], [3(8)], [3(9)] and [3(10)] above pleaded errors in the Tribunal's consideration of the merits; merits review being impermissible in the context of determining whether the Tribunal's decision was a decision made under the Act; I was referred in that regard to Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272; moreover the weight that the Tribunal may give to some evidence compared to other evidence was a matter for the Tribunal, and it was not for the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given thereto; I was referred generally in that regard to the reasons for decision of the High Court in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24; (iv) as to the grounds summarised in [3(5)], [3(6)] and [3(9)] above, the Tribunal gave proper consideration as to whether, as a practical matter, the appellants could genuinely access domestic protection in India, and whether that protection was meaningful; the Tribunal observed specifically that the appellant husband/father was a well educated young man with the ability to speak three languages, and moreover that country information demonstrated as implausible his claims that he could not relocate safely within India, and found that there was nothing to suggest that any attempt had been made to locate him since he had left his home town; in those circumstances it was submitted that the Tribunal gave proper consideration to the appellants' relocation within the principles enunciated in Randhawa at 270 (per Black CJ with whom Whitlam J agreed); (v) the grounds summarised in [3(4)], [3(11)], [3(12)] and [3(13)] were essentially claims as to his Honour's bias, whereof there was no evidence; moreover there was no suggestion in the evidence that the appellants were not given an opportunity to present their case or were somehow overborne by the Tribunal or the Federal Magistrates Court; an allegation of actual bias carries of course a heavy onus and must clearly be established see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at 531."

Case24832,cited,Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238,"After considering the proposed orders, the history of this matter, and the submissions of Counsel I am satisfied that the orders proposed by the parties in relation to the contempt charges are appropriate in the circumstances. My reasons are as follows: 1. I accept the applicant's submissions in relation to withdrawing the charges against the first respondent. I note that the first respondent is in liquidation, and the submission in Court on Monday by Mr Aggs, liquidator of the first respondent, that the first respondent is insolvent. I accept the proposition that, in these circumstances, pursuit of the first respondent, which is a corporate entity, is pointless. There are no funds to satisfy any orders, for example, for a fine or costs. It is therefore appropriate for the Court to grant leave to the applicant to withdraw these charges. 2. I accept the applicant's submissions as to withdrawing the charges against the fifth respondent, in light of his age, his role in the conduct the subject of the applicant's claims, and the concession by the applicant as to the evidence against him. 3. I note that the second, third and fourth respondent have pleaded guilty, which is an issue to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence ( NW Foods 71 FCR at 293). I note also the submission of Mr Atkinson for the second, third and fourth respondents that, in pleading guilty, the respondents have avoided the need for two trials, each of which was estimated to be four to five weeks, and have therefore relieved the resources of both the Court and the applicant (cf NW Foods 71 FCR at 291). 4. In this case, the second, third and fourth respondents have pleaded guilty to a statement of charge alleging deliberate and repeated instances of contempt of the orders of Cooper J. Given the nature of the contempt, a significant penalty is in order. 5. The Courts have generally accepted that a term of imprisonment is appropriate only in the most serious criminal contempt cases: R v Fletcher; Ex parte Kisch [1935] HCA 1 ; (1935) 52 CLR 248 at 257 per Evatt J, Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238. In this case the proposal of the parties that the third and fourth respondents be sentenced to six months imprisonment, albeit suspended, is at the high end of the range of penalty for contempt, particularly as it is common ground that the respondents had not previously been found by the Court to have acted in contempt. However, the serious nature of the contempt charges in this case, to which the second, third and fourth respondents have pleaded guilty, in my view warrants the prospect of a period of imprisonment. 6. The Federal Court is empowered to impose a sentence of imprisonment for contempt of court, to be suspended on conditions including as to length of time of the suspension: Hughes (trading as Crowded Planet) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 319 at [56] . In the case before me, the proposal that the sentence of six months be suspended for two years is consistent with other decisions involving similarly serious contempts of court (cf Hughes [2004] FCAFC 319 at [57] ). 7. In my view, however, while the sentence is at the higher range, it is not so high as to be oppressive ( NW Foods 71 FCR at 293, cf Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Matthews (2001) 39 ACSR 110 where the contemnor was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, suspended for two years and the Court similarly found that the sentence was not so high as to be oppressive). 8. I note the parties jointly propose that the period of imprisonment of the third and fourth respondents be suspended. In this context however I note that the applicant in this case is the State regulator in the field of consumer protection. It is appropriate to accord weight to the views of the regulator, in particular as to the deterrent quality both for the respondents and for others who may be disposed to engage in conduct of a similar kind ( NW Foods 71 FCR at 292, Mobil Oil [2004] FCAFC 72 at [79] ). 9. Although the award of costs is at the discretion of the Court, commonly in contempt cases there is a link between the award of indemnity costs and the penalty, where the award of costs is in lieu of a fine: Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 per Moore J at [8]-[12]. In this case the proposed orders do not include a fine to be paid by the second, third and fourth respondents, however they do impose an obligation on these respondents to pay a not insignificant sum in costs to the applicant. 10. I am satisfied that this is not a case where the nature of the proposed penalty is an insufficient deterrent by community standards so as to cause the Court to decline to sanction the proposal. I note the submissions by Mr Atkinson that the suspension of the six month sentence results in the third and fourth respondents being their own ""judge and jury"" for 24 months and that this is well-calculated to ensure their good behaviour. While this remains to be seen in practice, the detailed and clear nature of the proposed orders, the permanent restraints on the conduct of the respondents as articulated in the proposal, the not inconsiderable length of time during which the sentence is suspended and the default period of imprisonment in the event of breach of the orders in my view means that the proposed penalty appropriate in this case."
Case2666,followed,Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Toea Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1443 ; (2006) 156 FCR 158,"In the present case, there is a single course of infringement (the creation of the Vawdrey Engineering Drawings and the resulting manufacture of trailers) of a single copyright (the Krueger Drawings). Both Camerons and Vawdrey joined in that infringement in that Vawdrey could not have completed its drawings and manufacture without receiving instructions, based on the Krueger Drawings, from Camerons, and Camerons could not have completed the infringement without the execution by Vawdrey of those instructions. Each participated in committing the wrong of which Krueger now complains and thus the liability of each for the damage sustained by Krueger as a consequence of commission of that wrong is to be determined as if each was a joint tortfeasor with the other: The Koursk [1924] P 140 , cited with approval in Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Toea Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1443 ; (2006) 156 FCR 158 at [149] ; see also Balkin and Davis, Law of Torts (3rd 2004) at [29.24]-[29.41]. 25 Dowsett J helpfully canvassed the principal tort authorities in Louis Vuitton at [148]-[170]; see also Bialkower v Acohs Pty Ltd (1998) 83 FCR 1 , 12. In deciding whether two defendants should be held jointly liable for copyright infringement, his Honour also relied on The Koursk , concluding that it must be shown that they acted in concert; that is, that there was a ""concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a coincidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage"": Louis Vuitton at [171]. Again, this is such a case. Camerons and Vawdrey concurred in the acts which caused Krueger the damage of which it complains; there was more than a coincidence of separate acts joining together to cause damage to Krueger. Accordingly, each of Camerons and Vawdrey is jointly and severally liable for the copyright infringement."
Case2438,cited,Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall Ltd [1991] FCA 557,"The Commission submits that a pleading of a conclusion is not necessarily objectionable; a pleading alleging agency is not objectionable ( Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall Ltd [1991] FCA 557 per French J at 7). It submits that the pleading represents a reasonable articulation of the case which is sought to be tried. A conclusion of agency will depend on the evidence to be adduced. 47 The Commission accepts that parts of the pleading state conclusions and are of a general nature. It submits that such pleading may still define the issues and inform the respondents of the case they have to meet. In the present case, the Commission says that a level of generality is appropriate and that a conclusion may also be a pleading of a material fact ( Kernel Holdings per French J; State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete [2003] FCA 1454 ; (1999) ATPR 41-961 per Drummond J). It submits that this, like Pioneer , is a case in which it is unnecessary to strike out a conclusionary pleading. It is not, the Commission submits, a question whether the facts pleaded are sufficient in themselves to give rise to a cause of action but whether it would be open on the pleadings to prove the facts at the trial which would constitute a cause of action (Pancontinental Mining Pty Ltd v Posgold Investments Pty Ltd (1994) 121 ALR 405 per Beaumont J at 414). The Commission submits that it has pleaded the overt acts of the alleged conspirators and the conclusion. The Commission says that, taken together, this leads to the conclusion that there was an arrangement or understanding which contained a provision of the type impugned."
Case11469,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd (1996) ATPR 41-515,"Decisions of this Court have identified additional relevant factors which can be taken into account (see Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076, at 52,152-52,153; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd (1996) ATPR 41-515 at 42,444-42,445): (v) the size of the contravening company; (vi) the degree of its power, evidenced by its market share and the ease of entry into the market; (vii) the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended; (viii) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level; (ix) whether the company had a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; (x) whether the contravenor has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention; (xi) similar conduct in the past; (xii) financial position; (xiii) deterrent effect."
Case21405,cited,Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35,"does no more than support a general principle that there may, for TPA purposes, exist a market in Australia even though it forms part of a wider international market. Hill J's decision was so understood by Middleton J in Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35. His Honour considered the meaning of a ""market in Australia"" in the context of s 45 of the TPA. Significantly, his Honour held (at 53) that: ""... the definition of ""market in Australia"" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree...In my opinion, Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 ( Riverstone ) was correct in concluding that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products (or services)"". Emirates and the other authorities to which I have referred make it clear that, simply because a market is global, this does not mean that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. The applicant's pleading is not, in my view, deficient by reason only that it speaks of the respondents being in competition with each other in the Australian market and throughout the world. There may be a market in Australia which forms part of a wider global market. That will, however, be the case only if the same firms are in close competition with each other to attract customers for their goods in both the global market and the Australian market which forms part of the global market. Unfortunately, the applicant does not plead sufficient material facts for the respondents to know clearly whether the applicant is alleging the existence of a global market (of which a market in Australia forms part) or whether it is alleging the existence of a market in Australia and a global market in which, for example, different or additional firms compete for business. The problem is compounded by the variable and imprecise phraseology to which attention has been drawn in paragraph 28 above. Although the applicant's most recent attempt to identify a market in Australia has remedied some of the defects in its original statement of claim, further refinement will be necessary before the necessary degree of precision is achieved. Foreign respondents giving effect to the arrangements in Australia In paragraphs 18 to 25 of the original statement of claim the applicant alleged, in the most general terms, that the foreign respondents gave effect to the cartel arrangements in Australia. There was a notable absence of material facts to establish this part of the applicant's case. In addition, the separate causes of action which needed to be established for the purposes of s 45 (2)(b)(i) and (ii), were rolled up."
Case24249,referred to,BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; (2000) 102 FCR 97,"Counsel for ANSTO drew attention to a number of authorities also relating to the relevant operation of the legislation. Specifically in relation to s 298K, in the context of BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; (2000) 102 FCR 97 the Full Federal Court (Black CJ, Beaumont and Ryan JJ) at [35] said as follows: 'It has to be borne in mind, in construing s 298K, that it proscribes conduct by "" an employer "" directed to "" an employee "" or "" other person "" (emphasis added). That use of the singular suggests that the alleged injury or alteration of position has to be examined in the light of the circumstances of each individual employee. (It is not the point that in the interpretation of statutes, the singular ordinarily includes the plural; here we are concerned with the indications of legislative intention to be discerned from the actual language used.) It is also significant that the conduct struck at by each paragraph of s 298K is expressed by an active verb: ""dismiss"", ""injure"", ""alter the position"", ""refuse to employ"", and ""discriminate"". That implies that the proscription is essentially against an intentional act of the employer directed to an individual employee or prospective employee.' 22 I should interpolate to point out that in relation to the subsequent single judge decision in BHP Iron Ore following upon the Full Court's remitter of the proceedings to the trial judge, Kenny J of this Court decided in Australian Workers Union v BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; (2001) 106 FCR 482, that '[ b ] efore s 298K(1) can apply , it must be possible to say of an employee that he or she is, individually speaking, in a worse situation after the employer's acts than before them; that the deterioration had been caused by those acts; and that the acts were intentional in the sense that the employer intended the deterioration to occur ' (see [54]). Upon that footing, the case foreshadowed by ANSTO was that Mr Lever '... has not established, or even alleged, that he ceased to be entitled to the benefits of an industrial instrument by reason of conduct of [ANSTO]', since '... there can have been no conduct of [ANSTO] that was for the reason prohibited by s 298L(1)(h)'. 128 Addressing what Mr Lever's case categorised as the first series of breaches pleaded by Mr Lever's points of claim (which of course I have earlier outlined), ANSTO emphasised that Dr Doherty's 'promotion' decision reflected the feature that Mr Lever '... [did] not challenge Dr Doherty's discretion as [Mr Lever's] supervisor to determine whether, and to what extent, to promote [Mr Lever], or the procedure adopted by Dr Doherty in his exercise of that discretion', but rather '... relate[d] to the possibility of a review of Dr Doherty's determination'. ANSTO contended that for Mr Lever to assert the existence of any assurance as to his future promotion to SPO1 'was an overly optimistic and untenable interpretation of the words attributed to Dr Doherty', ANSTO describing the words attributed by Mr Lever to Dr Doherty as 'innocuous' and such as not to have 'preclude[d] [Mr Lever] from pursuing any available avenue for a review of his December 2000 promotion' to SPO2, yet which Mr Lever did not seek to do. Attention was drawn then by ANSTO specifically to what Mr Lever alleged to have constituted breach of s 298K(1)(b) and (c) on account of Dr Doherty's failure merely '... to inform [Mr Lever] of his rights to a review of Dr Doherty's decision', and to the irrelevance of Mr Lever's ignorance of the availability of review, if such ignorance had been in fact a reality. Attention was further drawn by ANSTO to the presence of the words ' do or threaten to do ' contained in each of the two subsections of s 298K, being words described by ANSTO as inapt to include any mere failure to do something, comprising as that statutory expression did the connotation of a proscription ' ... essentially against an intentional act of the employer directed to an individual employee or prospective employee ' (see again in that regard dicta earlier cited from BHP Iron Ore v AWU ). 129 On that footing, ANSTO's case was that Mr Lever '... has not established that any conduct of [ANSTO] caused him to miss an opportunity to seek a review of Dr Doherty's decision to promote him', and further that Mr Lever did not express any intention '... to seek a review at the time of the relevant discussions with Dr Doherty', nor did he establish 'that the conduct of [ANSTO] was the reason for his failure to seek such a review'. ANSTO emphasised that Mr Lever did not allege for instance that Dr Doherty 'took any direct action to prevent a review in the knowledge that [Mr Lever] was seeking one', nor was there evidence of any action to such effect. It could not be said therefore, so the ANSTO submission continued, that for instance 'Dr Doherty intended his conduct to frustrate a course of action proposed by [Mr Lever] of which Dr Doherty was ignorant'. There is clear force in that ANSTO response to the first series of breaches alleged by Mr Lever. 130 It was pointed out moreover by ANSTO that if a failure to seek a review did involve an injury to Mr Lever ' in his... employment ' or an alteration of his ' position ' to his ' prejudice ' within the meaning of pars (b) or (c) of s 298K(1), then any such failure was attributable in any event to '... the actions or inaction of [Mr Lever] subsequent to the conduct of Dr Doherty'. Since Mr Lever knew of the availability of review, so ANSTO maintained, '... it was his own decision to forbear from pursuing one'; and further that since Mr Lever had not proved the so-called 'forbidden conduct' the subject of present consideration, it was unnecessary for ANSTO to prove the reason for it. Moreover it was ANSTO's case that there was an absence of evidence as to Dr Doherty harbouring any prohibited reason, he being the person whose conduct was sought to be impugned and the only person whose reasons could be ultimately relevant."

Ms Klewer argued before Raphael FM that the Korora property is not divisible amongst her creditors for two reasons: that the moneys used to purchase the property constituted ""protected money"" within the meaning of s 116(2D) of the Act and that the Korora property was held in trust by Ms Klewer for Robert Klewer and was therefore not property divisible amongst Ms Klewer's creditors by virtue of the operation of s 116(2)(a) of the Act. 3 On 11 March 2008, the appellants filed a notice of appeal ' from part of the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court '. The ground of appeal was: ' That the evidence supports the existence of a trust '. On 18 June 2008, an amended notice of appeal was filed from the whole of the judgment of Raphael FM. The sole ground of appeal is: ' Procedural unfairness '. No particulars are provided. 4 At the hearing of this appeal, Ms Klewer says that her grounds of appeal are: &#8226; Procedural unfairness, because: - She appeared by telephone before the Federal Magistrate; - She was unable to hear everything that was said during the hearing before the Federal Magistrate; - The Federal Magistrate did not cross-examine her other children who had filed affidavits; - The Federal Magistrate ""assumed"" what the other children had meant from their statements and drew the wrong conclusions from those statements; - She and her son did not have legal representation. &#8226; That the evidence established an express trust in favour of Robert Klewer, or, in the alternative, an implied or constructive trust."

Case2010,considered,SZKSO &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 1413,"The appellants applied for a review of the Tribunal decision ( SZKSO &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 1413). The appellants relied on a number of grounds including a claim of bias on the part of the Tribunal and a failure to comply with s 424A of the Act. 7 Federal Magistrate Scarlett rejected the appellants' claim that the Tribunal had made its finding with bias (at [21]). His Honour noted that the basis of that claim was that the Tribunal had completely ignored independent evidence submitted to it but observed that this does not constitute bias (at [21]). His Honour noted that it was open to the Tribunal to prefer the evidence of the expert to the evidence of the first appellant (at [19]). 8 In dealing with an alleged failure by the Tribunal to comply with its obligations under s 424A of the Act, the Federal Magistrate concluded that s 424A had been complied with and that that ground failed (at [22]). 9 His Honour also dismissed what appeared to be a claim that the appellants had not been provided with a hearing as required by s 425 of the Act. As his Honour noted, there was no transcript to show that the evidence of the appellants was unduly curtailed or truncated or that they were prevented from anything (at [23]). 10 The appellants appeared in person, assisted by an interpreter, and provided particulars of the bases or the grounds of appeal upon which they relied. The notice of appeal contains three grounds, that the Federal Magistrate: 1. erred in law by incorrectly assessing the appellants' claim that the Tribunal ignored or failed to consider their claim, ignored relevant materials, misstated or misconceived the claim, made a mistake in relation to an important finding of fact and incorrectly assessed the first appellant's credibility; 2. was wrong in finding that the Tribunal considered the appellants' claims properly when the Tribunal made its finding with bias and ignored evidence put to it; and 3. was wrong in finding that the Tribunal complied with its obligations under s 424A of the Act. 11 Before me, the first appellant explained that the appellants were not saying that the Tribunal had failed to consider a claim that had been made to it but rather that the Tribunal did not believe what the first appellant had said. A decision on credibility is a matter for the Tribunal. This ground of appeal does not succeed. 12 The appellants did not point to any matter which the Tribunal ignored other than to assert that the Tribunal preferred the evidence of the expert, which it should not have done because the expert was not familiar with grapes in China. The first appellant also asserted that, while in the response to the s 424A letter the appellants were unable to provide further information about the grape type that they said that they had grown, this information could easily have been found on the internet. The appellants complained that the Tribunal had not found it."
Case3754,distinguished,Park Oh Ho v Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1988) 81 ALR 288,"In Park Oh Ho v Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1988) 81 ALR 288, the Full Court of the Federal Court (Sweeney and Foster JJ, Morling J dissenting) held that a deportation order had not been issued for the purpose of securing various persons' removal from Australia, but was to secure their continued detention in custody, so that their evidence would be available in contemplated criminal proceedings. 291 The decision of the Full Court upheld the decision of Davies J at first instance, to declare the deportation orders a nullity and set them aside. The matter went to the High Court, but only on the question of whether the Full Court had been correct in upholding the refusal of Davies J to make a declaration of unlawfulness. It was on this basis that the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court was reversed."
Case20928,referred to,Conquo v Jackson [2009] FCA 45,"parties did not dispute the nature of the test to be applied on an application for interim orders. In McGee v Sanders (No 2) [1991] FCA 554 ; (1991) 32 FCR 397 , at 402-403, Gray J discussed the test to be applied, saying: In opening the application for interim orders, counsel for the applicants indicated that she would endeavour to show that there existed a serious issue to be tried as to the applicants' entitlement to relief, and that the balance of convenience favoured the applicants. I am by no means convinced that these tests, which have been applied by courts in dealing with applications for interlocutory injunctions, are appropriate to the specific statutory power under s 209(4) of the Act. It should be noted that the power to make interim orders is given in broad terms. The court may make ""such interim orders as it considers appropriate"". Parliament has not chosen to use the word ""injunction"". The practice in granting or refusing interim orders differs from the practice in relation to interlocutory injunctions in at least one important respect. It is rare for an applicant for interim orders to be called upon to give an undertaking that he or she will pay damages in the event of failure. In my view, it is the duty of the court to do justice as best it can when confronted by an application for interim orders. Sometimes, the evidence proffered by an applicant will be uncontested and will demonstrate a strong case. In such circumstances, a court will naturally be more ready to make orders on an interim basis. In Conquo v Jackson [2009] FCA 45 , at [16], Sundberg J approached an application for interim orders, having regard to this passage and also the test for a conventional interlocutory injunction. Broadly speaking, on the present application, counsel approached the matter by examining the ""serious question"" issue and the ""balance of convenience"", noting at the same time that it was ""the duty of the court to do justice as best it can""."
Case10597,cited,Paul Dainty Corp Pty Ltd v National Tennis Centre Trust (1990) 22 FCR 495,"In Paul Dainty Corp Pty Ltd v National Tennis Centre Trust (1990) 22 FCR 495 the Full Court said (at 515): The authorities make it clear that equity will not impose fiduciary obligations on parties who have entered into ordinary and arm's length commercial relationships, which fully prescribe the respective powers and duties of the parties. This is particularly so when the parties involved are substantial corporations, having equal bargaining power. And in Elders Trustee and Executor Co Ltd v EG Reed Pty Ltd (1987) 78 ALR 193, Gummow J referred to the circumstances in which parties are acting in commercial transaction, at arms length and with the assistance of independent professional advice and observed: Whilst these considerations are not of themselves decisive indicia of the absence of fiduciary obligations of disclosure ... they are of significance: Keith Henry &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Stuart Walker &amp; Co Pty Ltd [1958] HCA 33 ; (1985) 100 CLR 342 at 350-1; Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corp [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 70, 119 and 146."
Case19207,applied,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355,"West Asia must still be a relevant person within the meaning of s 19(a) in one of the two ways on which Euroceania relies. Each of the connecting factors referred to in s 19(a) (the owner, charterer, ""in possession or in control of"") should be construed to have a distinct meaning and operation: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381-382 [69]-[71] (esp at [71]) per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. Of course, there will be some overlaps: e.g. an owner or demise charterer will often be in possession of a ship and, indeed, in control of her. But a voyage or time charterer may only meet the description ""charterer"" in s 19(a). Nor does s 19 require that the general maritime claim be one that the plaintiff could commence as a proceeding in rem against the ship referred to in s 19(a): Laemthong 190 CLR at 202-203."
Case10933,considered,Re Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Schneider Electric (2002) 4 ITLR 1077,"are passages in a decision of the French Conseil d'&Eacute;tat in Re Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Schneider Electric (2002) 4 ITLR 1077 which, read in isolation, might be thought to support an opposite conclusion in relation to the immateriality of economic consequences when considering whether a national CFC regime was in conflict with Article 7 of an OECD model treaty with Switzerland. For example, in referring to Article 7 of the Franco-Swiss double taxation agreement, the Conseil d'&Eacute;tat opined (at 1108): In the absence of any factor requiring a different interpretation, the 'profits' to which art 7 of the convention refers are those determined according to the rules established by the [French General Tax Code]. It follows that the court below did not make any error in deciding that there is an identity in nature between the business profits (b&eacute;n&eacute;fices) of the Paramer company, the taxation of which is attributed to Switzerland by art 7(1) of the Franco-Swiss tax treaty, and the profitable results (r&eacute;sultats beneficiaries) of the Paramer company which are taxed in France in the name of the Schneider company on the basis of the [CFC regime in the French General Tax Code]."

Case1095,applied,Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298,"On the contrary, the evidence which I accept is that Mr Sathaar, to whom Mr Coon answered, praised Mr Coon for his work on 9 December 2005. Mr Sathaar is still employed by the respondent and was available to give evidence. He was not called. Consequently, the Court is able more confidently to conclude that the evidence of Mr Sathaar would not have assisted the respondent on this question and to accept the evidence of Mr Coon that he was praised for his work on the day: Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 ( Jones v Dunkel ) 47 Then, the evidence of the nature of the failings in Mr Coon's work was unsatisfactory and cast doubt on the accusation that Mr Coon had failed to fulfil his duties. There were a number of allegations made by Mr Thornton against Mr Coon which were so extravagant or so lacking in detail as to make them improbable. There were sufficient occasions of such evidence as to indicate that Mr Thornton's accusations against Mr Coon should not be relied upon. 48 For instance, in [6] of the respondent's contentions filed on 10 July 2007 prior to the hearing and authored by Mr Thornton prior to the respondent securing legal representation, it was said: The second applicant was placed on a dimensional checking role which he performed very poorly and resulted in the respondent shipping incorrect work and receiving rectification costs of approx $250,000. The respondent was served with a notice to produce which sought production of any documents relating to these costs. The respondent produced a credit note dated 30 June 2007, for $50,000 in favour of Monodelphous Pty Ltd. This represented the amount accepted by the respondent for rectification costs of the dispatch of steel on 9 December 2005. When this document was put to Mr Thornton in cross examination he said that he did not mean the contentions to say that Mr Coon was responsible for the whole $250,000 rectification costs. He said that the paragraph was just poorly worded and was prepared by him without assistance. Having regard to the centrality and seriousness of the allegations made, these explanations were, and came across in the witness box as, unconvincing. Further, the credit note came into existence well after the dismissal and could not have been the reason for it. Perhaps sensing these shortcomings Mr Thornton took the opportunity shortly afterwards and following a lunch break to use a question in cross examination as a means to seek to retrieve the situation. The exchange was as follows: Well, you don't point us to any other instance of his alleged poor performance at any time than 9 December, do you?---Yes, well, I will say one thing, which was in relation to this $250,000, point six, which is made on the contentions of fact, saying that we had that he just worked that one day and we made $250,000 worth of errors that day. He didn't, but he was working for about two weeks prior in the beamline as a QO man, effectively letting errors go through, I believe, intentionally. When do you say he was working for two weeks in the beamline as a QO man?---You might need to ask Mr Coon exactly, but I spoke to Mr Sathaar at lunch time. He said, ""No, he worked for about two weeks in the beamline as a like a QO person in the same role."" You went and telephoned Mr Sathaar in the lunch break?---Am I not allowed to do that? Well - - -?---Sorry, I didn't realise that was something I wasn't allowed to do. It was explained to you, I think before the before we broke when we broke for lunch by your counsel that you weren't to be having any discussions over the break, wasn't it?---He said I couldn't talk to him. All right, but you thought you were at liberty to go off and speak to Mr Sathaar to find out the situation?---Well, if you want clarity on what happens, isn't that the best thing? 50 Further, the information was obtained over lunch from Mr Sathaar. Mr Thornton said, in effect, that this was the obvious thing to do because Mr Sathaar had the relevant information. And yet Mr Sathaar was not called to give evidence. He was supervising Mr Coon in the job as quality inspector and was present in the yard when, as Mr Thornton alleged, the errors were found. Mr Sathaar was involved in correcting the errors also. Mr Coon denied each of these facts. Mr Thornton also said that he and Mr Sathaar discussed Mr Coon's unsuitability for the job and the reasons for dismissing Mr Coon at the end of his trial period. It can be concluded from the failure of the respondent to call Mr Sathaar that he would not have assisted the respondent's case on these issues: Jones v Dunkel . 51 Another obstacle faced by the respondent in its argument that Mr Coon caused significant cost to the respondent by failing to inspect the steel in the yard properly was that Mr Thornton said that he, his father, and Mr Sathaar had to do the job which Mr Coon had failed to do. If this were so, and they had done the inspection, one would expect that there would have been no faulty steel dispatched on that day. Consequently, there would have been no rectification costs incurred. When faced with this suggestion in cross examination Mr Thornton responded that: ... I'm not sure we rechecked everything. 52 The lack of certainty expressed in this answer is at odds with Mr Thornton's evidence of his extreme level of anxiety arising from the circumstances of the day which Mr Thornton had previously described. 94 Both Mr Sathaar and Mr Thornton's father could have given evidence as to how far away from the meeting they were standing, whether they were checking steel as Mr Thornton said, and whether the speakers were audible to them. Both men were available to the respondent and are in its camp. Their absence from the witness box leads to the conclusion that their evidence would not have assisted the respondent: Jones v Dunkel . 95 I prefer the evidence of Mr Kemmis, Mr Coon and Mr Taylor that Mr Thornton was no more than 30 metres from the meeting. In particular Mr Taylor had a recollection of the location of the management group by reference to a particular door of the plate work factory. This was a level of detail not found in Mr Thornton's recollection. I also accept the evidence of Mr Taylor that the speakers aimed to have Mr Thornton hear what was said and that it was said loudly for Mr Thornton to hear. 96 I find that the evidence positively establishes that Mr Thornton was present within 30 metres of the meeting for the purpose of observing and listening to what was said. I further find that he heard Mr Coon and Mr Kemmis speak at the meeting in favour of union involvement in negotiating a collective agreement with the respondent, and he observed workers at the meeting vote in favour of this course."

Case20223,cited,Nokia Corporation v Truong (2006) 66 IPR 511,"The central question arising is whether the term 'consumables' falls within the ordinary dictionary meaning or terms in the specifications of Brother's Australian trade marks, in particular, the terms 'parts', 'accessories' and 'attachments'. The dictionary definition of 'accessory' has been considered in the authorities and has been described as "" an additional or subordinate thing; an adjunct, an accompaniment; a minor fitting or attachment "": see Nokia Corporation v Truong (2006) 66 IPR 511 at 516. 66 I accept Brother's submissions that printer drum units are apparatus for the transmission or reproduction of images, and that the categorisation of a printer drum unit as a 'consumable' does not take it outside the description of a 'part', 'accessory' or 'attachment'. The evidence of both parties' witnesses indicates that printer drum units are part of the internal working of printers, facsimiles and multi-function devices. They are called consumables because they are parts or accessories with a limited life span, which is generally shorter than the life span of the machine in which they function. Although printer drum units are not fixed permanently within the machines and are removable for replacement, the machines cannot function without them. Given this essential role of the printer drum units, it is wrong to characterise them on the basis they are not a part of or an accessory to those machines. Accordingly, the proper conclusion is that trade marks 440897, 479964 and 1000137 are registered in respect of Brother's printer drum units, such as the Brother DR-200. I also accept Brother's submission that the cardboard box in which a printer drum unit is packaged is itself a 'good' made of cardboard falling within the scope of both class 16 and the specifications of registered trade mark 479964. Indeed, there was little genuine dispute on this point. 67 However, despite my finding that printer drum units are covered by the specifications of trade marks 440897, 479964 and 1000137 (and cardboard packaging by the specifications of trade mark 479966), in my view, Dynamic Supplies' submission that registered trade mark 1000137 was registered only after the conduct of Dynamic Supplies impugned by Brother, and therefore was not breached by that conduct, is correct. The trap purchases in this case were made in late February and early March 2004, and Brother did not register trade mark 1000137 until 30 April 2004. It is not possible, therefore, for registered trade mark 1000137 to be infringed by Dynamic Supplies' conduct in the same way the remainder of Brother's Australian trade marks have been. 68 For these reasons, I find that both the Brother DR-200 units and Brother DR-200 packaging are goods in respect of which Brother's Australian trade marks are registered, but that trade mark 1000137 has not been infringed by the Dynamic Supplies' conduct. 69 A respondent which uses an applicant's registered trade mark in the course of trade in relation to goods which fall within the scope of the mark's specifications will not infringe the mark if the use was with the consent of the applicant: see s 123 of the Act ."
Case10674,applied,Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788,"SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 , Lander J was confronted with an application for leave to amend a Notice of Appeal and an application to adduce further evidence, being the transcript of the proceeding before the Tribunal. In refusing leave to amend, His Honour referred to those principles relevant to the grant of leave to raise new grounds on appeal but further observed (in part): [21] Parliament has given the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction in relation to applications of this kind to the exclusion of this Court: s 476A of the Act. All of the issues which are sought to be ventilated should be addressed at the trial in that Court. Parliament has provided for a right of appeal to this Court and in matters of this kind the appellate jurisdiction of this Court may be exercised by a single Judge: s 25(1AA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Indeed, that is the case on this appeal. ... [24] The appellate process is to correct error. If a party is entitled to raise issues for the first time on appeal, the appeal court will become de facto the primary court. That is undesirable. It is particularly undesirable where the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is being exercised by a single judge and any right of appeal from that single judge is to the High Court. If a party is entitled to raise an issue for the first time on appeal in this Court, the High Court will be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from judges sitting alone who have not had their decision reviewed. That must be particularly undesirable from the High Court's point of view. [25] Moreover, to allow new grounds of appeal is to defeat the purpose of the legislation which requires that judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to be within solely the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. If new grounds are advanced on appeal, it effectively means that the jurisdiction is being exercised by this Court. [26] Of course, appeals of this kind are particularly sensitive: Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788. It is particularly important to the party seeking refugee status that that party's claim be considered by the Tribunal in accordance with law. That said, however, it seems to me that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the appellate jurisdiction that parties be bound by the way in which they conducted their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court: H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1348 ; (2000) 63 ALD 43. These observations of His Honour were recently endorsed by Spender J in SZMRD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 598 at [11] . And in Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788 , Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ also observed: [24] ... in order to determine whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice that leave be given to argue new grounds it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the grounds raised. That does not mean that an appellate court should enter upon a full consideration of the grounds. To do so would make the requirement for leave meaningless. It is sufficient to determine whether the grounds sought to be raised have a reasonable prospect of success. We also consider it appropriate to take into account whether the appellant had the benefit of legal representation at the hearing before the primary judge. In the present proceeding the Federal Magistrate has in fact gone on to express brief "" views "" as to those arguments which were at least embraced by the Grounds set forth in the Application as initially filed. To that extent, this Court has had the benefit of the obiter views helpfully expressed by the Federal Magistrate. In addressing these further Grounds , the Federal Magistrate concluded (in summary form): (i) Procedural fairness : There was held to be no denial of procedural fairness. The now Appellant was said to have been given an opportunity of being heard in respect to the adverse conclusions as made by the Tribunal, and those adverse conclusions were held to have been made in reliance on the now Appellant's own evidence. (ii) Jurisdictional error : The Federal Magistrate observed that "" no particulars "" of this Ground were provided. To the extent that a challenge was made to the manner in which the Tribunal reached its state of "" satisfaction "", the Federal Magistrate observed that the Tribunal was "" not required to uncritically accept any, or all, of the applicant's claims "". (iii) The decision was ""unjust"" : In respect to this Ground the Federal Magistrate observed that no jurisdictional error was exposed as "" [t]he Tribunal's findings were open to it on what was before it "". It was further observed that "" [t]he Tribunal gave cogent reasons in support of its findings "". (iv) A failure to consider an aspect of the claim : This Ground was rejected by the Federal Magistrate upon the basis that the Tribunal did consider the claim advanced. "" At best "", the Federal Magistrate observed, the Ground was "" an assertion that the applicant meets the definition of ""refugee"" as set out in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention "". (v) A failure to investigate and ""actual bias"" : The Federal Magistrate rejected a contention that there was a "" general duty to inquire "" and further concluded that there was "" nothing before the Court to suggest bias, or the apprehension of bias, on the part of the Tribunal ..."". No appellable error is exposed in these conclusions of the Federal Magistrate &#8212; even if leave is to be granted to raise the matter addressed as Grounds of Appeal . The final Ground of Appeal that the Appellant seeks to raise, Ground 7 in the Notice of Appeal , was not raised at any stage of the proceeding before the Federal Magistrate. The Ground does not make sense, even allowing for the fact it may have been drafted by someone whose native language is not English. For this reason, this Ground too has no prospects of success."

It is based on the reasons for decision of the RRT and on the material before the FMC, does not involve the adducing of any further evidence and does not cause injustice or unfairness to the respondents. Furthermore, in view of the conclusions at which I have arrived, it is clearly in the interests of justice that the leave sought be granted: cf Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 438 [34] - [35] per Allsop J (with whom Drummond and Mansfield JJ agreed). 6 The appellant's claim before the RRT was that she fears persecution if she returns to Turkey because she is on a PKK blacklist because of her husband's activities in the Special Forces against PKK members ('the blacklist claim'). As the RRT accepted that the appellant had a subjective fear of persecution as she claimed, it was bound to determine whether that claim fell within the Convention. One aspect of that determination was whether the subjective fear of persecution held by the appellant by reason of the blacklist claim was well founded. Another aspect was whether the fear of persecution held by the appellant was for reasons of an actual or imputed political opinion or as a member of a particular social group being that she is a person on a PKK blacklist or she is the wife of a person on a PKK blacklist. On a fair reading of the decision of the RRT, the claim considered by it was a different claim, namely whether a fear of persecution held by a member of the armed forces or as a family member of a member of the armed forces was well founded. This is apparent from the way in which the RRT expressed its decision and from the country information upon which it relied."

The plaintiff in each of these actions alleges that in so doing, the tug came into contact with the hull of the Global Peace causing damage which led to the discharge of oil into harbour waters. The plaintiff in action NSD 124 of 2006 alleges that oil came into contact with the hull of its vessel, ""Medi Vitoria"", causing loss and damage. The plaintiff in action NSD 125 of 2006 alleges that oil damaged its vessel, ""Nord Stream"". Each plaintiff sues the first defendant as owner of ""Global Peace"", seeking damages. It is not presently necessary to address the potentially difficult legal questions concerning the extent of the first defendant's responsibility for the conduct of the tug, its master and crew. The first defendant denies liability. On 18 April 2007, after I had received submissions in connection with the motion with which I am presently concerned, Adsteam Harbour Pty Ltd, the owner of the tug, was joined as second defendant in each action. THE MOTION 1 On 23 October 2006, on the application of the plaintiff in each case, the Registrar issued a subpoena directed to: 'The Proper Officer Australian Transport Safety Bureau 15 Mort Street Canberra City ACT 2601.' 2 Although it is not entirely clear, it seems that the subpoena was intended to compel production of documents in each case, and not attendance to give oral evidence. I am presently considering a notice of motion which seeks an order that in each case, the subpoena be set aside. The applicant is said to be Australian Transport Safety Board. However counsel announced that they appeared for Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the body named in the subpoena. I have been unable to identify any such legal entity. The Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 (Cth) (the ""Act"") contemplates the appointment of an Executive Director of Transport Safety Investigation (the ""Executive Director""). That officer and his delegates have numerous responsibilities and powers under the Act. It may be that the subpoena ought to have been directed to the Executive Director, but no such point has been taken. I infer that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau comprises the Executive Director's staff, and that there is a person who is recognizable as the ""Proper Officer"" of that organization to whom a subpoena might properly be addressed. I proceed upon the basis that such person is the applicant pursuant to the notice of motion. THE SUBPOENA 2 Pursuant to s 21 of the Act the Executive Director investigated the collision between Global Peace and the tug and, in August 2006, published a report. This report is publicly available. In effect, the plaintiffs seek access to the material upon which the report is based. A schedule to the subpoena provides as follows: Schedule The documents and things you must produce are as follows, copies of: (Note: In this Subpoena the term ""Incident"" means the collision between MV ""Global Peace"" and the Tug ""Tom Tough"" resulting in the discharge or escape of oil from the ""Global Peace"" into Gladstone Harbour at Gladstone on 24/25 January 2006). 1. Any documents or other records in relation to oil analysis, sampling analysis, testing or testing results of the oil discharged from the ""Global Peace"" on 24 and 25 January 2006. 2. Any documents or other records or reports or survey reports or status or situation reports or similar documents in relation to the extent or known extent, spread, range and distribution of the oil discharged or escaped from the ""Global Peace"" as a result of the Incident. 3. Any photographs or other images, whether electronic or hard copy of the extent or known extent, spread, range and distribution of the oil discharged or escaped from the ""Global Peace"" as a result of the Incident. 4. Any Gladstone vessel traffic service (VTS) records or documents in relation to the incident, whether audio, digital, electronic or written from 12 noon on 24 January 2006 to the time of the departure of the ""Global Peace, including but not limited to the extent or known extent, spread, range and distribution of the oil discharged or escaped from the ""Global Peace"" as a result of the Incident. 5. Any documents, statements or other records of interview of the Master, Pilot, officers or crew of the ""Global Peace"" or the ""Tom Tough"" in relation to the Incident, including but not limited to the extent or known extent, spread, range and distribution of the oil discharged or escaped from the ""Global Peace"" as a result of the Incident. 6. Any records or records of investigation or inspection or reports or survey reports or similar documents in relation to the extent of damage and/or holing of the shell plating of the ""Global Peace"" by way of the port deep fuel oil tank at or about frames 42-46 as a result of the Incident. 7. Any records or records of investigation or inspection or reports or survey reports or similar documents in relation to the fender and support beam arrangement of the starboard quarter fender of the ""Tom Tough"". 8. Any Master's Notes of Protest in relation to the Incident, including but not limited to the extent or known extent, spread, range and distribution of the oil discharged or escaped from the ""Global Peace"" as a result of the Incident.' THE PROPER OFFICER'S RESPONSE 3 On 2 November 2006 a Deputy Director of the Bureau notified the Registrar that: &#8226; it held documents which were responsive to the subpoena; &#8226; such documents were 'restricted information' as defined in s 3 of the Act; &#8226; such documents were held by 'staff members' as there defined; &#8226; the Executive Director had not issued a certificate pursuant to s 60(5) of the Act; and &#8226; in those circumstances the documents could not be disclosed by staff members to the Court. 3 As I have said the Proper Officer has applied to set aside the subpoena. THE PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NON-PARTY DISCOVERY 4 After hearing oral submissions I reserved my decision. I then formed the view that the plaintiffs ought to have sought non-party discovery pursuant to O 15A rather than the issue of a subpoena. I was concerned that certain statutory provisions upon which the Proper Officer relies in support of the motion might not apply to an order pursuant to O 15A in the same way as to a subpoena. I accordingly invited the parties to make submissions. The plaintiffs then sought leave to issue notices of motion seeking orders pursuant to O 15A r 8. However the parties do not consider the distinction to be of any importance for present purposes. I proceed upon that basis. PLAINTIFFS' SUBMISSIONS 5 In their written submissions, the plaintiffs challenge the validity of ss 53, 56, 57, 58 and 60 of the Act. However I understand the Proper Officer to rely only on s 60. I need not consider the other sections. The plaintiffs submit that s 60 of the Act is 'an impermissible interference with the jurisdiction vested in the Federal Court' by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) (the "" Admiralty Act ""). They submit that in these actions, the Federal Court is exercising jurisdiction conferred upon the Court pursuant to s 76(ii) and (iii), s 77 and s 71 of the Constitution 'and that jurisdiction cannot be ousted directly or ... indirectly.' They submit that s 60 is 'not a law with respect to any plenary power within s.51 and/or s 98 of the Constitution and accordingly, is invalid and/or to be read down under s.15A of the Acts Interpretation Act ... so as to create no offence by disclosure to a court under compulsion of subpoena and so as not to interfere with the Court's process and power to compel production of documents ... .' It is further submitted that it is for the Court and 'not an executive director' to decide whether documents should be produced or withheld and questions of admissibility in federal matters. This proposition is said to flow from the decision of the High Court in Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 38. 6 Appropriate notices have been given pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). There has been no intervention and no application for removal. SECTION 60 OF THE ACT 7 Section 60 of the Act provides: ' Staff members (1) A person who is or has been a staff member is guilty of an offence if: (a) the person makes a record of information; and (b) the information is restricted information. Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years. (2) A person who is or has been a staff member is guilty of an offence if: (a) the person discloses information to any person or to a court; and (b) the information is restricted information. Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years. Non-staff members (3) A person who has, or had, access to restricted information under section 62 must not: (a) make a record of the information; or (b) disclose the information to any person or to a court. Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years. Defences (4) Subsection (1), (2) or (3) does not apply to: (a) anything done by a person in performing functions under this Act or in connection with this Act; or (b) disclosure to a court in criminal proceedings for an offence against this Act; or (c) disclosure to a court in civil proceedings where: (i) the Executive Director issues a certificate under subsection (5); and (ii) the court makes an order under subsection (6). Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to a matter in subsection (4). See subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code . Certificate (5) The Executive Director may issue a certificate in relation to restricted information, stating that the disclosure of the information is not likely to interfere with any investigation. Courts (6) If the court is satisfied that any adverse domestic and international impact that the disclosure of the information might have on any current or future investigations is outweighed by the public interest in the administration of justice, the court may order such disclosure. (7) The court may direct that the restricted information, or any information obtained from the restricted information, must not: (a) be published or communicated to any person; or (b) be published or communicated except in such manner, and to such persons, as the court specifies. (8) If a person is prohibited by this section from disclosing restricted information, then: (a) the person cannot be required by a court to disclose the information; and (b) any information disclosed by the person in contravention of this section is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceedings (other than proceedings against the person under this section).' 8 The relevant provisions seem to be subss 60(2) and 60(8). The prohibition applies to a limited class of person (staff members) and to a limited class of information (restricted information). Those terms are defined in s 3 as follows: ' staff member means: (a) the Executive Director; or (b) an APS employee who is assisting the Executive Director in exercising powers under this Act; or (c) a person to whom the Executive Director, has delegated any of the Executive Director's powers under this Act'; and: 'restricted information means any of the following (but does not include OBR information): (a) all statements (whether oral or in writing) obtained from persons by a staff member in the course of an investigation (including any record of such a statement); (b) all information recorded by a staff member in the course of an investigation; (c) all communications with a person involved in the operation of a transport vehicle that is or was the subject of an investigation; (d) medical or private information regarding persons (including deceased persons) involved in a transport safety matter that is being or has been investigated; (e) in relation to a transport vehicle that is or was the subject of an investigation-information recorded for the purposes of monitoring or directing the progress of the vehicle from one place to another or information recorded in relation to the operation of the vehicle; (f) records of the analysis of information or evidential material acquired in the course of an investigation (including opinions expressed by a person in that analysis); (g) information contained in a document that is produced to a staff member under paragraph 32(1)(b) or 36(3)(a) or (4)(a).' 9 The prohibition is further limited in that the Executive Director may determine that disclosure is not likely to interfere with any investigation. In that event the Court must consider whether or not the material should be received as a matter of public interest. Thus the Court's power to compel disclosure is only removed if the Executive Director has not so determined. The prohibition does not apply to criminal proceedings for an offence against the Act. 10 The definitions of ""restricted information"" and ""staff member"" demonstrate that the prohibition primarily concerns information obtained as the result of investigations conducted pursuant to the Act. There is no prohibition upon the independent collection of the same information. On-board recording information (""OBR information"") is in a different category, but I do not understand it to be relevant for present purposes. The prohibition in s 60 is not limited in its operation to proceedings in Commonwealth and state courts exercising federal jurisdiction. It also applies to proceedings in state courts exercising state jurisdiction. 11 It seems likely that much of the material will be in the form of statements from witnesses. Such statements would not usually be admissible in evidence unless the witnesses in question were called. Of course hearsay is no longer an absolute bar to admissibility. Nonetheless, one suspects that the material would be more valuable in directing the plaintiffs' lines of inquiry than as evidence. JURISDICTION AND POWER 12 This matter concerns the power of the Federal Court to compel the production of documents. The plaintiffs seem to assume that conferment of jurisdiction must involve the unlimited power to compel the giving of evidence including such production. The Court's jurisdiction is conferred by statute. Delineation of such jurisdiction is therefore a matter of statutory construction. Parliament may give or withhold any aspect of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. A grant of subject matter jurisdiction such as that in s 9 of the Admiralty Act will usually carry with it a grant of the power necessary to perform the relevant judicial functions. See Nicholas v The Queen [1998] HCA 9 ; (1998) 193 CLR 173 at [23] . If Parliament expressly withholds or withdraws a particular power, there can be no basis for asserting that the Court has it. It is possible that the withholding or withdrawal of a power necessary to the performance of a particular judicial task may render it impossible for the Court to perform its judicial function. In that case the conferment of jurisdiction might fail or be implicitly revoked. In construing the legislation which confers relevant jurisdiction upon it, the Court will seek to give effect to all aspects of such legislation. However, at the end of the day, clear legislative provisions must be given appropriate effect. Quite clearly, Parliament intended to deprive this Court of the power to compel the disclosure of restricted information by staff members, save where the Executive Director has issued a certificate. In my view it is no answer to say that because the Federal Court has statutory jurisdiction to determine the issues raised in these actions, s 60 must necessarily be unconstitutional in so far as it applies to it. I say nothing about the application of the section to the High Court or to state courts. 13 A further misconception underlies the plaintiffs' attempt to draw an analogy between public interest immunity, as a basis for resisting the disclosure of documents, and this legislation. The plaintiffs refer to the decision in Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 38 as authority for the proposition that the validity of a claim to such immunity is a matter for the court in question. At that time, however, the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (the "" Evidence Act "") had not been enacted. The question of the admissibility or otherwise of such evidence is now regulated by s 130 of that Act. There has been no suggestion that s 130 constitutes an unlawful interference with proceedings in this Court. 14 Historically, the courts have not enjoyed such a wide power to compel the giving of evidence as is implied by the plaintiffs' submissions. For example, as the Court of Appeal held in Warren v Warren [1997] QB 488, under the common law judges were competent, but not compellable, witnesses as to matters of which they became aware, relating to, and as a result of, the performance of the judicial function. In Australia that position is now regulated by s 16 of the Evidence Act . Other provisions contained in Division 1 of Part 2.1 of the Evidence Act also regulate the compellability of witnesses. The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 (Cth) regulates the calling of parliamentarians as witnesses and the proof of parliamentary proceedings. This legislation was no doubt enacted pursuant to s 49 of the Constitution . Nonetheless it demonstrates the fallacy of the general proposition asserted by the plaintiffs that it is for a court to determine, in its absolute discretion, who should be summoned to give evidence and the evidence which should be given. THE DECISION IN NICHOLAS 15 The relationship between the judicial power of the Commonwealth and Parliament's legislative authority in connection with witnesses and evidence was explained by the High Court in Nicholas (supra). That case concerned the power of a criminal court to exclude evidence upon the ground that it had been obtained in circumstances in which unlawful conduct had been committed by law enforcement officers. In light of an earlier decision of the High Court, Parliament had legislated to prohibit the exclusion of evidence on that ground. The accused submitted that the legislation was invalid as purporting to direct a court to exercise its discretionary power in a manner, or to produce an outcome which was inconsistent with, the essential character of a court or with the nature of judicial power. At [20] et seq, Brennan CJ said: '20. ... A law that purports to direct the manner in which judicial power should be exercised is constitutionally invalid ... . However, a law which merely prescribes a court's practice or procedure does not direct the exercise of the judicial power in finding facts, applying law or exercising an available discretion. For the purposes of the accused's first submission, the function of a court to which s 15X relates is the finding of facts on which the adjudication and punishment of criminal guilt depends. 21. Section 15X does not impede or otherwise affect the finding of facts by a jury. Indeed, it removes the barrier which Ridgeway placed against tendering to the jury evidence of an illegal importation of narcotic goods where such an importation had in fact occurred. Far from being inconsistent with the nature of the judicial power to adjudicate and punish criminal guilt, s 15X facilitates the admission of evidence of material facts in aid of correct fact finding. 22. However, to identify the adjudication of criminal guilt as the relevant exercise of judicial power is not to deal with the effect of s 15X on which the accused relies to challenge its validity. The accused's argument is not that the adjudication by the jury of criminal guilt is affected by s 15X but that s 15X governs the determination by the trial judge of the challenge to the admission of evidence of an illegal importation. The argument assumes that the exercise of discretion to admit or reject evidence is itself an exercise of judicial power distinct from a step in the practice or procedure which governs the exercise of judicial power. 23. The judicial power of a court is defined by the matters in which jurisdiction has been conferred upon it. The conferral of jurisdiction prima facie carries the power to do whatever is necessary or convenient to effect its exercise. The practice and procedure of the court may be prescribed by the court in exercise of its implied power to do what is necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction ... but subject to overriding legislative provision governing that practice or procedure. The rules of evidence have traditionally been recognized as being an appropriate subject of statutory prescription. A law prescribing a rule of evidence does not impair the curial function of finding facts, applying the law or exercising any available discretion in making the judgment or order which is the end and purpose of the exercise of judicial power. E.S. Roscoe ... observing that the common law had produced a law of evidence of such high technicality as ""justly merited the wholesale condemnation of Bentham"" credits Lord Denman with the initiation of the move for legislative reform. The preamble to the Evidence Act 1843 (Imp) ... shows the need which was perceived to warrant legislative intervention: ""Whereas the Inquiry after Truth in Courts of Justice is often obstructed by Incapacities created by the present Law, and it is desirable that full Information as to the facts In Issue, both in Criminal and in Civil Cases, should be laid before the Persons who are appointed to decide upon them"" it was enacted that certain evidentiary rules be changed. Even though judicial opinion was opposed to the enactment of the Criminal Evidence Act 1898 ... it would not have occurred to the Imperial Parliament that a legislative power to prescribe rules of evidence might be regarded as a usurpation of judicial power.' 16 At [24] Brennan CJ referred to earlier decisions, in particular the decision of Higgins J in Williamson v Ah On [(1926) [1926] HCA 46 ; 39 CLR 95 at [122] and continued: 'However, Isaacs J pointed out a difference between a rule of evidence and a provision which, though in the form of a rule of evidence, is in truth an impairment of the curial function of finding the facts and hence an usurpation of judicial power. He said: ""It is one thing to say, for instance, in an Act of Parliament, that a man found in possession of stolen goods shall be conclusively deemed to have stolen them, and quite another to say that he shall be deemed to have stolen them unless he personally proves that he got them honestly."" If a court could be directed by the legislature to find that an accused, being found in possession of stolen goods, had stolen them, the legislature would have reduced the judicial function of fact finding to the merest formality. The legislative instruction to find that the accused stole the goods might prove not to be the fact. The legislature itself would have found the fact of stealing. Isaacs J continued: ""The first is a parliamentary arbitrary creation of a new offence of theft, leaving no room for judicial inquiry as to the ordinary offence; the second is only an evidentiary section, altering the burden of proof in the ordinary case of theft, and requiring certain pre-appointed evidence to fit the special circumstances in the interests of justice, because the accused best knows the facts, and leaving the Court with these provisions to examine the facts and determine the matter."" ' 17 At [26], Brennan CJ continued: 'If s 15X had simply declared that evidence of an illegal importation should be admitted, denying any discretion in the trial judge to exclude the evidence, the provision would simply have enlarged the evidentiary material available to a jury to assist it to find the facts truly. It would have been a mere procedural law assisting in the court's finding of material facts. No exception could be taken to such a law consistently with the authority cited above. But s 15X leaves the trial judge with a discretion to reject evidence of importation of narcotic goods in an authorized controlled operation, requiring only that in exercising the discretion, the illegal conduct of law enforcement officers should be disregarded. The existence of the judicial discretion does not alter the classification of the law as a law governing the admission of evidence and therefore a law governing procedure. The procedure for determining the admission of evidence of illegal importation is affected, but the judicial function of fact finding is unchanged and the judicial power to be exercised in determining guilt remains unaffected.' 18 Toohey J said at [53]: 'It is a considerable step to reason that legislation may not affect the way in which judicial power is exercised. It is an even bigger step to contend that the legislature may not provide that evidence possessing a certain character must be treated in a certain way or that evidence of a particular character must be rejected or, for that matter, admitted. It might be necessary, in a particular situation, to look closely at the consequences of rejecting or admitting the evidence. Those consequences may, for instance, be so inimical to the idea of a fair trial that a question arises as to the power of the legislature, at any rate where the judicial power of the Commonwealth is involved. In Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth ..., where the operation of a law retroactively was one of the issues, I said: ""It is only if a law purports to operate in such a way as to require a court to act contrary to accepted notions of judicial power that a contravention of Chapter III may be involved."" The operation of s 15X falls far short of that situation. It postulates a particular evidentiary footing upon which a court may then proceed where the admissibility of evidence that narcotic goods were imported into Australia is at issue. Section 15X is an evidentiary provision. It does not determine whether a charge of an offence ... will succeed or fail.' 19 Gummow J said, at [144]-[146]: '144. The present dispute does not turn upon the nature of the liabilities of the accused under s 233B of the Customs Act which are subjected to determination by the exercise of judicial power, nor upon the consequences of that determination. The accused is liable to the determination of criminal guilt and the consequent infliction of punishment. There is a correlative right of the accused to the determination of that guilt and the infliction of punishment by the exercise of judicial power. What is at the heart of the complaint by the accused is legislative prescription as to the manner of the exercise of the judicial power at his trial. 145. The essential question concerns the limitation imposed by s 15X upon the discretion which the trial court otherwise would enjoy to exclude evidence that the heroin in question was imported into Australia in contravention of the Customs Act . Is this such an interference with the governance of the trial and a distortion of its predominant characteristics as to involve the trial court in the determination of the criminal guilt of the accused otherwise than by the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth? 146. The legislative powers of the Commonwealth do not extend to the making of a law which authorises or requires a court exercising the judicial power to do so in a manner which is inconsistent with its nature ... Thus, a legislative direction requiring a court not to release a person held in unlawful custody is a direction as to the manner (and outcome) of the exercise of its jurisdiction and is an impermissible intrusion into the exercise of the judicial power ... Nor would a legislative direction be valid if it required a court in exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth to order exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth to order imprisonment, not on the basis that the persons in question had breached any criminal law, but upon an opinion formed by reference to material, not necessarily admissible in legal proceedings, that, on the balance or probabilities, they might breach such a law.' 20 At [162] his Honour concluded: 'The section in its operation, if not necessarily on its face, deals not with proof but with a discretion to exclude evidence of facts. It operates to facilitate the proof by the prosecution of its case by the admission of evidence that otherwise was liable to exclusion. The case for the accused is made that much more difficult than it would have been if s 15X had not been enacted. However, the section does not deem any ultimate fact to exist, or to have been proved. It leaves untouched the elements of the crimes for which the accused is to be tried. Nor does s 15X change the amount or degree of proof essential to convict him from that required when the alleged offences were committed.' 21 At [232] et seq, Hayne J said: '232. It was submitted that the discretion to reject evidence of illegally procured offences is a common law (as opposed to statutory) discretion which is exercised by the courts to protect the integrity of their processes. No doubt this is so. Equally there is no doubt that a court which exercises the discretion is exercising judicial power. Thus, when the trial judge ruled that the evidence which the prosecution proposed to lead of the importation of the heroin which it was alleged that Nicholas had, or had attempted to have, in his possession should be excluded, the trial judge was exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth. But it by no mean follows from these considerations that Parliament may make no law touching the discretion. 233. At the outset it is necessary to recall that the discretion is one which is rooted in public policy and requires the balancing of competing considerations. Part 1AB seeks to have the Court strike that balance differently in some kinds of cases, presumably because the Parliament considers that the public interest requires it. The effect of Nicholas' contentions is that only the courts may determine what the public interest requires. I do not accept that that is so. 234. The facts that the discretion is a creature of the common law and is concerned with the protection of the integrity of the courts' processes do not mean that the discretion cannot be affected by legislation. There are many rules which have been developed by the common law which have been changed or even abolished by legislation and yet it is not suggested that such legislation intrudes upon the separation of judicial and legislative powers. Nor do the facts that the discretion is designed to protect the integrity of the courts and that the discretion is ""an incident of the judicial powers vested in the courts"" ... take the discretion altogether beyond the reach of the legislature. Whether other considerations would arise if Parliament attempted to abolish the discretion altogether is a question I need not, and do not, address. The legislation now in question does not abolish the discretion it affects only some kinds of prosecutions and then only in the limited circumstances that are prescribed in the legislation. 235. Moreover, Part 1AB is concerned with a rule about the reception or rejection of certain evidence. That Parliament may make laws prescribing rules of evidence is clear and was not disputed. Plainly, Parliament may make laws (as it has) on subjects as diverse as the circumstances in which hearsay may be received ... or the circumstances in which confessional statements by accused persons may be admitted in evidence and it may do so to the exclusion of the previous common law rules ... . 236. The common law rules that were developed in these areas were often, if not always, developed with questions such as reliability of evidence or fairness to the accused at the forefront of consideration and thus, at least to that extent, with questions of the integrity of the curial process and its results well in mind. And yet such legislation does not infringe the separate of powers.' 22 At [238] his Honour continued: 'Once it is accepted that the legislature may make or change the rules of evidence it is clear that it may make or change the rules governing the discretionary exclusion of evidence. In particular, it may make or change rules governing the factors which a court is to take into account in exercising that discretion.' 23 See also Kizon v Palmer (1997) 72 FCR 409, per Lindgren J at 446-7, Jenkinson and Kiefel JJ concurring, and Rann v Olsen (2000) 172 ALR 395, per Doyle CJ at [190]-[192], Prior J at [230], Perry J at [258], Mullighan J at [284] and Lander J at [391]. 24 In light of these authorities there is simply no room for the submission that Parliament cannot make laws relating to the admissibility or inadmissibility of evidence. There may be extreme cases in which the consequence of a statutory provision is that a judicial function performed in accordance with it would not be recognizable as judicial in nature. That may lead to the conclusion that the provision is unlawful or that the conferment of jurisdiction was not, or is no longer, valid. However it cannot be seriously suggested that the present case is of that kind. No attempt was made to establish that it was. 25 The plaintiffs also submit that the power conferred on the Executive Director by subs 60(5) is judicial and therefore not capable of conferment upon that officer. There is no reason for treating the power as being judicial in nature other than that it results in evidence not being receivable in a court. Once it is accepted as it must be, that Parliament may legislate to exclude certain matters from being received in evidence, there seems to be no reason why it should not be able to empower an identified person to determine whether or not the Act's protection should be invoked or waived. If this argument were valid, it would seem to follow that the legislation extending such protection should also be characterized as judicial and not legislative. There is nothing in this point. The submission is also put in a slightly different way. It is said that the legislation subordinates exercise of the judicial power to an executive discretion. While such a proposition has the typical appeal of a rhetorical flourish, it fails to address the fundamental problem that the authorities recognize the power of Parliament to legislate in connection with rules of evidence. 26 Finally, the plaintiffs submit that s 60 'compromises the integrity of the judicial system, because it goes to the question of the power of the court to make orders with which the executive or, in this case, with which people will comply.' The administration of law is, no doubt, a public function of primary importance in a civilized society, but other functions are also important. Whilst the courts balance the interests of one litigant against another, Parliament must balance the interaction between different public functions. It is for Parliament to determine the balance between the right of a litigant to lead evidence and the objects identified in s 7 of the Act. There is nothing in this point. CONSTITUTIONAL POWER 27 As to the assertion that there is no head of power which authorizes enactment of s 60, the Proper Officer relies upon subss 51(i) [xx] and [xxix] and s 98 of the Constitution . The plaintiffs have made no attempt to demonstrate any basis for arguing that the legislation is beyond the power conferred by those provisions. My understanding of their argument is rather that there is no express authorization for legislation which has the effect of restricting the power of this Court to compel classes of witnesses to give evidence of a particular kind. As I have said that argument cannot be maintained. Section 60 is within power. ORDERS 28 In each action the subpoena should be set aside. The plaintiffs should pay the Proper Officer's costs of and incidental to the motion. I will entertain any application pursuant to O 15A r 8 should the plaintiffs wish to proceed further with that course. I certify that the preceding twenty-eight (28) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.

His Honour there referred to 511(2) of the Act which provides that the Court may accede to an application if it is satisfied that the exercise of the power will be ""just and beneficial."" 19 In Dean-Willcocks , Young J was of the view that this means that the Court has a discretion as to whether the making of an order under s 511 will be of advantage in the liquidation. For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that this test is satisfied. 20 I should also note Young J's consideration, in Dean-Willcocks at 212 to 213, of the question of whether it is appropriate to make an application such as this ex parte . His Honour observed at 213 that it is proper for such an application to be made ex parte , as has been done in the present case. I will therefore make orders in terms of the short minutes of order, as amended, which I will sign and date. I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.

Case14260,cited,San Remo Macaroni Company Pty Ltd v San Remo Gourmet Coffee Pty Ltd (2000) 50 IPR 321,"I do not think it can be said that handbags, purses and wallets are of the same description as backpacks. Backpacks, especially those in respect of which Colorado Group or its predecessor applied the mark (being school backpacks), are not put to the same use as handbags, wallets or purses. The nature of the products is, to my mind, quite different. Backpacks are highly functional and directed toward comfort, weight-bearing, support and durability while wallets and purses have a predominant fashion purpose. While perhaps not decisive, a person wishing to buy a backpack would not find a handbag, wallet or purse to be an acceptable substitute or alternative: see San Remo Macaroni Company Pty Ltd v San Remo Gourmet Coffee Pty Ltd (2000) 50 IPR 321, 330; Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v Brook (1996) 69 FCR 401, 410-411.

Case19725,referred to,"Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752","Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752 at [41] , Bennett J observed that there is no requirement for the employees of Employment Service Providers to identify the basis of their delegated power before signing a Newstart Activity Agreement with a job seeker. Justice Bennett considered the crucial issue to be whether a valid delegation had been made. At [19], Bennett J found that the respondent in Lim had proven that: In contrast to the circumstances described in Lim , the respondent did not produce evidence before the Tribunal to show that MatchWorks provided services to the respondent pursuant to an arrangement described in cl 3 of the delegation, or that the relevant employees of MatchWorks were employed to perform functions and provide services pursuant to that arrangement. In particular, no document was before the Tribunal to show that MatchWorks was an Employment Service Provider within the meaning of cl 3(b) of the delegation. The mere assertion in submissions that such was the case is not tantamount to evidence before the Tribunal. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there was any material on which the Tribunal could conclude that a valid delegation from the respondent to MatchWorks was in place at the time of the Participation Failure. The application must be remitted to the Tribunal. Although it is not strictly necessary to do so the Court will deal now with the other issues raised in argument. No negotiation of the Newstart Activity Agreement Mr Piotto also alleges that the Tribunal erred in not finding that there was no negotiation of the Newstart Activity Agreement for the purposes of s 605(3) of the Act."

This provision reflects the common law presumption that statutes are read ""as being prima facie restricted in their operation within territorial limits"": see Jumbunna Coal Mine NL v Victorian Coal Miners' Association [1908] HCA 95 ; (1908) 6 CLR 309 at 363 per O'Connor J, discussed in DC Pearce and RS Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (6 th ed, 2006) at [5.5].

In Hella-Australia , Street J refused an interlocutory injunction on the basis that an article did not infringe a registered design under s 30(b) of the Designs Act 1906 (Cth) unless the design had been applied to the article in Australia. Following Hella-Australia , Parliament amended s 30, with the result that the importation and sale of articles to which the design had been applied outside Australia were also infringements: see Designs Amendment Act 1967 (Cth) (""the 1967 Amendment"") and Polyaire Pty Ltd v K-Aire Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 32 ; (2005) 221 CLR 287 at 293. Although Hella-Australia concerned a provision in the former Act, nonetheless it and the authorities referred to in Carnival Cruise and Carnival Cruise itself, establish that, absent contrary statutory intent, infringements must occur within Australia. Accordingly, on the evidence, Redberry's liability could not arise under s 71(1)(a) but only under s 71(1)(b), (c), (d) or (e)."

Such judgments, no doubt, have a part to play in the decision of the executive government in entering into the treaty. They may also, at least in theory, have a bearing upon the legislative decision whether or not to disallow particular treaty regulations and in the ultimate decision of an Attorney-General whether or not to surrender a requested person. The acceptability to Australia of the system of criminal justice in an extradition country is an issue ""...to be determined by the Government of the Commonwealth when deciding to extend the application of the Extradition Act to the State in question, whether by treaty or regulation, and, in a given case, perhaps before ordering the surrender of the fugitive ... in exercise of the discretion ... given the Attorney-General"": Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 23 FCR 472 at 514; 86 ALR 464 per Gummow J.

Case451,discussed,Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd v Marlin International Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 958,"On the other hand, there is also authority for the proposition that filing and service, without more, operates as a full or limited waiver: eg, Complete Technology Pty Ltd v Toshiba (Australia) Pty Ltd (1994) 53 FCR 125; Austress v Marlin [2002] NSWSC 958 ; Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Neate (1998) 144 FLR 373; Black &amp; Decker Inc v Flymo Ltd [1991] 1 WLR 753; In the Marriage of Crowe [1988] FLC 91-983 and Leaders Shoes (Aust) Pty Ltd v National Insurance Co of New Zealand Ltd [1968] 1 NSWR 344. As one would expect, Cadbury relies on these cases. Cadbury also relies on Liberty Funding (2005) 218 ALR 283, where the Full Court of the Federal Court considered this conflicting authority. Although the Full Court did not formally decide the issue, it did suggest that the proper approach must recognize the distinction between legal professional privilege and the implied undertaking (with respect to the implied undertaking, see [19-22] below). The Full Court's criticism of the Smoothdale line of cases (at [25]) was in the following terms: The difficulty with the approach in Smoothdale is highlighted by the approach of Barrett J in Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd v Marlin International Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 958 in which his Honour distinguished cases such as Smoothdale on the basis that they were concerned with use in one proceedings of a statement or an affidavit filed and served in another. Barrett J, on the other hand, was dealing with the question whether a party could tender, as an admission, parts of an affidavit sworn by the opposing party in the same proceeding. Barrett J said, buttressed by ample authority, that this could be done, because it was within the range of permitted use the purpose of the proceedings. Barrett J was undoubtedly correct. Thus, it is necessary to posit a limited waiver, within a broad framework of the conduct of proceedings, which may bring about the result (as in Austress ) that it is in the other side's power to destroy the privilege entirely by putting the statement or affidavit into evidence or examining or cross-examining on its contents. (Emphasis added.)"
Case20005,considered,Davies Coop and Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1947] HCA 64 ; (1948) 77 CLR 299,"Lindsay drew attention furthermore to what was described as the leading authority on the meaning of the combined expression process or treatment, as appears in the context of sub-paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of 'aids to manufacture' contained in the legislative precursor to the STEC Act, being the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 (Cth), the words process or treatment appearing of course in each of pars (a), (b) and (c) of the Item 18(5) definition of manufacture-related activity. That authority is Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd (1981) 33 ALR 251, which was decided by the Supreme Court of Victoria (Gobbo J) at first instance, and which decision was upheld on appeal to a Full Court (Lush, Kaye and Brooking JJ) (1981) 37 ALR 595. At first instance, Gobbo J reviewed (at 268) dictionary meanings of processing and treatment , as follows: 'Turning first to the meaning of ""processing or treatment"", there is nothing in the context of Item 113C to suggest that the ordinary meaning of treatment found for Item 14 should not be adopted. Treatment was there taken to mean the act of subjecting to chemical or physical action so as to bring about a change in form nature or condition. I further found that in its context such treatment had to be directed to a relevant result, namely to use or marketability. As to processing this in my view should in its context in Item 113C and Reg 4 be taken to have a different and probably wider meaning than treatment.... These meanings all suggest that a change in nature form or condition is effected. I am disposed to the view that even in processing some change must result if this procedure is to be regarded as a process.' Lindsay drew attention in particular to 'subjecting to... physical action... [and] condition' , and also to 'use or marketability', appearing above, being expressions reflected explicitly or implicitly in Item 18(5)(a) to (c) within the definition of manufacture-related activity . After referring to Davies Coop and Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1947] HCA 64 ; (1948) 77 CLR 299, Gobbo J observed at 269 in Hamersley Iron that authority 'supports a meaning of processing that does not require that there be a change producing a commercially distinct article...', and his Honour referred to recent English authority which had 'adopted the view... that alteration of the material was not necessary to involve subjecting it to a process'. That submission was soundly conceived. 57 The Commissioner submitted however that the reasons for decision in Hamersley Iron at first instance and on appeal did not support Lindsay's case, upon the basis that '[r]efrigeration is not a chemical change, and it is doubtful whether it would be regarded as a physical action on the goods of the sort contemplated by the definition of a manufacture-related activity within subItem 5(5)'. The difficulty for the Commissioner is that even if a chemical change is not effected by refrigeration, refrigeration must at least involve physical action. Lindsay pointed out that in Hamersley Iron, '[t]he stacker and reclaimer were machines which physically stacked, and then physically blended the iron ore to ensure homogeneity', which the Commissioner appeared to accept was sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that a process or treatment was involved. However the Commissioner contended further that 'the mere cooling of goods during transport is qualitatively different from the process under consideration in Davies ', because there the winding of the yarn onto the cones and tubes was described as 'part of the process of bringing the ultimate product, namely the piece goods, into a form or condition in which they could be marketed' . The difficulty for the Commissioner flowing from any comparison of the factual circumstances in Hamersley Iron , and also in Davies , is that whilst the physical outcome of the process or treatment might be described in each case as more significant in terms of process and extent of change, the STEC notion of applying a process or treatment of goods appearing in the Item 18(5) definition of manufacture-related activity would clearly enough accommodate situations of varying degree, depending upon the nature and extent of the process or treatment the subject of application. I have not found the Commissioner's endeavours to distinguish the circumstances in Hamersley Iron (or Davies for that matter) from the present to be persuasive."
Case9690,followed,Livestock Traders International Pty Ltd v Bui (1996) 22 ACSR 51,"Section 459F(2) provides that, where application is made under s 459G to set aside a statutory demand, the ""period for compliance with [the] statutory demand"" is, if the Court ""makes an order that extends the period for compliance with the demand"", the period specified in the order of the Court (s 459F(2)(a)(i)) ; or ""otherwise ... the period beginning on the day when the demand is served and ending 7 days after the application under s 459G is finally determined or otherwise disposed of [(s 459F(2)(a)(ii))]"". The word ""otherwise"" in s 459F(2)(a)(ii) is a ""laconic"" expression of the condition that none of the conditions in s 459F(2)(a)(i) has been fulfilled: see Livestock Traders International Pty Ltd v Bui (1996) 22 ACSR 51 ("" Livestock Traders "") at 53. Once one of these conditions in s 459F(2)(a) is fulfilled here, by the registrar's making of the order extending the time for compliance then s 459F(2)(a)(ii) can have no operation. Jenkinson J reached the same conclusion in Livestock Traders where, as in this case, a registrar of the Court dismissed an application to set aside a statutory demand and extended the time for compliance with the demand. There was no compliance with the demand within the extended time, although there was an application on foot to review the registrar's decision. His Honour held at 53, that ""once an exercise of the power to extend the period for compliance has occurred no operation is left to subpara 459F(2)(a)(ii)"" of the Corporations Law as it then was. This provision is identical to s 459F of the Corporations Act . His Honour said, also at 53, that ""[t]he use of the word 'otherwise' in that subparagraph ... compels that conclusion"". I agree. 48 Upon G &amp; J Gears' application, the Court would have had power to extend time further at any time after the registrar made the order extending time until the expiry of that time. It would have been open to the company to have made such an application before the end of this period had there been grounds, but it did not do so: see Equuscorp at 701 per French, Kiefel and Sundberg JJ; Graywinter Management Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 22 ACSR 636 at 638 per Finn J; Shakespeares Pie Co Australia Pty Ltd v Multipye Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1201 ("" Shakespeare Pie "") at [7] per Barrett J; Australian Beverage Distributors Pty Ltd v Cranswick Premium Wines Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 877 ("" Australian Beverage Distributors "") at [12] per Barrett J; and Livestock Traders at 54. Once the time for compliance has passed, however, the Court has no such power. 49 This limitation upon the power to extend time is implicit in the terms of ss 459F and 459C . Section 459F(1) operates to fix the time when a company on which a statutory demand has been served is taken to fail to comply with the demand. The significance of a failure to comply with a statutory demand is the subject of s 459C(2)(a) , which provides that the Court must presume that a company is insolvent if, during or after the 3 months ending on the day when the application is made, the company fails to comply with the statutory demand. The effect of ss 459F(1) and 459C (2)(a) is that the Court can only make an order under s 459F(2)(a)(i) extending the time for compliance prior to the end of the period for compliance, i.e., before the company is presumed to be insolvent. Within this period, an order extending the time can be made where a s 459G application has been rejected and that rejection is the subject of review or appeal. This is now well-settled: compare Vista Commercial Construction Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 25 ACSR 285 at 293 per Burchett, Hill and Emmett JJ; Graywinter Management Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 22 ACSR 636 at 638 per Finn J; Graywinter Properties Pty Ltd v Dyer (1997) 15 ACLC 302 at 306 per Ryan J; Buckland Products Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2003] VSCA 85 ("" Buckland Products "") at [8] per Phillips JA; Shakespeares Pie at [7] per Barrett J; and Australian Beverage Distributors at [5] per Barrett. As Jenkinson J said in Livestock Traders at 54, ss 459F and 459C (2)(a) of the Corporations Law ""premise unalterability of the time as at which a company is to be taken to have failed to comply with a statutory demand once the period for compliance has ended at a time when the demand is still in effect"". This is equally true of the equivalent sections of the Corporations Act . The power to extend time after the end of the period for compliance would introduce a degree of uncertainty incompatible with the statutory regime: see also Buckland Products at [8] per Phillips JA. 52 Once G &amp; J Gears is taken to have failed to comply with the statutory demand and to be insolvent, the application to set the demand aside is fruitless and the application to review the registrar's decision, nugatory: compare Livestock Traders at 55. As Phillips JA said in Buckland Products at [9]: ""If the company was wishing to appeal it could do so, but unless the appeal was heard and determined before the expiry of the period for compliance otherwise fixed, an extension of the time for compliance had to be obtained. Without it, there could be no point in the continued prosecution of the appeal, for, the period of compliance having ended before the appeal was heard and determined, the consequence prescribed by s.459F(1) attached, with all that followed under the statute."" 53 It follows from what I have said that, strictly speaking, it is unnecessary to consider whether an application under s 459G is ""finally determined or otherwise disposed of"" by the registrar's determination that the application should be dismissed. I would observe, however, that there was nothing put in argument that would lead me to differ from Jenkinson J, who said in Livestock Traders at 53, that he was ""inclined to think that 'the application is finally determined' when an order determining the application is made, notwithstanding that the order is, if made by a registrar, reviewable, and that the order is, if made by the court, subject to appeal."" See also Buckland Products at [5]-[9] per Phillips JA. 54 In view of this conclusion, it is also strictly unnecessary to consider whether there was any error in the registrar's decision. But as this was the subject of extensive argument, I set out my views briefly."

Various methods of measuring damages for infringement of copyright have been described: see Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 at [11] and TS&amp;B Retail Systems Pty Ltd 158 FCR 444 at [204]-[209]. 58 I come now to Krueger's claim for additional damages. In a claim for additional damages under s 115(4) of the Copyright Act , some general observations were made by Besanko J in Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 at [17] : First, there is no need ... to consider if an award of additional damages can be made under s 115(4) [even where] no damages are awarded under s 115(2) because I have awarded ... damages under s 115(2) ( Polygram Pty Ltd v Golden Editions Pty Ltd (No 2) 38 IPR 451 at 459-461 per Lockhart J; MJA Scientifics [International Pty Ltd v S C Johnson and Son Pty Ltd (1998) 43 IPR 275] at 283-284 per Sundberg J). Secondly, it is not necessary that there be a proportionate relationship between the additional damages awarded under subs (4) and the damages awarded under subs (2): Flags 2000 Pty Ltd v Smith (2003) 59 IPR 191 at 198 per Goldberg J. An award of additional damages under subs (4) is not dependent upon the adequacy or inadequacy of an award of damages under subs (2). Thirdly, the matters in subs (4)(b)(i)-(iv) inclusive are not preconditions to an award of additional damages. In other words, and using the flagrancy of the infringement as an example, the Court must have regard to the flagrancy of the infringement in determining whether to award additional damages, but is not the case that additional damages can be awarded only if the breach involves a particular degree of flagrancy. Fourthly, ...there is a distinction between conduct of a defendant after an infringement (or after being informed that he has allegedly infringed the plaintiff's copyright) and relevant to the substantive allegations against him on the one hand, and the defendant's conduct of his defence to an action for an infringement of copyright in relation to procedural matters on the other. The former matter is within the terms of s 115(4)(b)(ib) of the [Copyright] Act, whereas ... the latter matter is a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate order as to costs. ... Fifthly, an award under s 115(4) of the [Copyright] Act can encompass damages which at common law would be aggravated damages and exemplary damages: Bailey 53 FCR at 113-114. 63 Vawdrey's conduct in its defence of the instant action must also be mentioned as it bears on the issue of costs: see Futuretronics at [17]. That conduct included: (1) Vawdrey's contention that Paul Vawdrey and if not Paul, then Michael Vawdrey, developed the load restraint system: see [20], [24], [44], [56] of the reasons for decision. On any view, those contentions were inconsistent with each other, as well the other evidence, and thus improbable to say the least; (2) Michael Vawdrey instructing an employee (Lang) to backdate the electronic copy of the second Vawdrey drawing (drawing number 25-1056-2) to be provided to Krueger during preparation for trial to create the impression that the document was created and sent on 5 December 2002 when in fact the drawing was sent no earlier than 12 December 2002, if at all: see [80] of the reasons for decision; (3) Michael Vawdrey adducing in evidence an internal job sheet of a hand drawing of what was described as a ""Vawdrey-type lock"" said to have been created in 1995 in support of a contention that the Krueger Concept was not original. In fact, the reference to the ""Vawdrey-type lock"" was added much later than 1995 and ""only in respect of the litigation"". Despite being called for, Vawdrey did not produce the original of the job sheet: see [101] of the reasons for decision; and (4) Vawdrey did not seek to explain how or when it came into possession of a copy of Krueger's invoice for the manufacture of the trailers with the handwriting of Cameron staff: see [73] of the reasons for decision. 64 I find that this conduct (separately and collectively) added significantly to the length of the trial. Moreover, it involved the use of tactics and taking of positions intended to benefit Vawdrey when Vawdrey knew that such positions and tactics were, at the very least, inconsistent with the objective evidence. Subject to what the parties have to say, I therefore propose to make the following costs orders: (1) Vawdrey pay on an indemnity basis one-third of Krueger's costs of, and incidental to, the proceedings through the end of the trial on liability; (2) Vawdrey pay on a party-party basis all of Krueger's costs of, and incidental to, the proceedings following the end of the trial on liability, excluding any costs of and incidental to Krueger's settlement with Camerons. 65 The reason I propose to award only one-third of Krueger's costs through trial against Vawdrey is that until the end of trial Camerons was also a party who would have been liable for a share of the prevailing party's costs. Indeed, it would have been liable for a greater share because, as noted earlier, Vawdrey was a respondent only in relation to the copyright claim, not the confidentiality claims. One might ask, then, whether it is more appropriate to make an indemnity costs order against Vawdrey only in relation to one half of Krueger's costs incurred in prosecuting the copyright claim. On its face, such an order would appear to more accurately capture the costs for which Vawdrey can be said to be responsible. The problem, however, is that much of the same evidence and facts was relevant to both the confidentiality and copyright claims and I foresee that it would thus be difficult, if not impossible, for the parties or a taxing master to allocate or separate costs on a claim-by-claim basis. Accordingly, and this is again subject to what the parties may say, I consider that in the circumstances the better approach is simply to order that Vawdrey pay a percentage share of Krueger's overall costs."

In Gordon v Tolcher , the High Court cited the Harmer Report to the same effect in relation to ""inordinate delays in commencing proceeding in respect of voidable transactions"" (at [38]). No such consideration applies with respect to s 664AA. 75 In Gordon v Tolcher , the Court considered the 3 year period within which to bring applications under s 588FF(3) to be immutable by rule of Court, in part because s 588FF(3)(b) specifically provided a judicial power to extend time: at [41]. The existence of a wider regulatory power to modify Chapter 6 is not a reason for discerning an intention to exclude the applicability of the judicial power under s 1322(4)(d). In the context of a complex piece of legislation such as the Act , there is no reason to assume that a role allocated to the regulator should be the foundation for contracting the scope of an otherwise broadly expressed power given to the Court. 76 On the contrary, the whole point of the power under s 669 is to allow a considerable measure of flexibility in the operation of Chapter 6 and such a fundamental legislative intention entirely supports the continued applicability of s 1322(4)(d) under Chapter 6. 77 The decisions, to which I have referred, which have limited the applicability of s 1322(4)(d) in relation to other provisions of the Act concern provisions that have significantly different legislative purposes to relevant provisions of Chapter 6. They do not concern circumstances where the whole of the relevant Part is subject to amendment by ASIC and where the party seeking an extension of time is dependent upon the conduct of others in order to meet the statutory deadlines. They are therefore not decisive of the applicability of s 1322(4)(d) here."

While the courts caution against too ready a resort to apportionment according to issue-based outcomes ( Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel [2000] FCA 62 at [3] (Full Court), cf Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 492) , more recently the Full Court has also observed that fairness should dictate how judicial discretion is to be exercised in respect of costs.

Case12609,applied,Avondale Motors (Parts) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1971) 124 CLR 97,"Whether Lilyvale carried on the same business from 1 January 2002 to 31 March 2003 as it did immediately before either 8 or 30 August 2002 requires careful consideration of Lilyvale's activities and responsibilities both before and after the critical date in August 2002. The question is one of fact; Avondale Motors (Parts) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1971) 124 CLR 97 per Gibbs J at 104. There are two elements to the concept of a taxpayer ""carrying on the same business"" and both must be addressed. First, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the concept of carrying on a business, taking into account the relevant statutory and commercial context. Then, having established that before the critical date the taxpayer is carrying on a business and the nature or characterisation of that business, it is necessary to ask if the taxpayer carried on the same business after the critical date. 60 In Avondale Gibbs J rejected a submission that the word ""same"" in the phrase ""same business"" meant ""similar"" or ""analogous"" rather than ""identical"". His Honour accepted that the meaning, as with any ambiguous phrase, depends on context and held that in the context of s 80E(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1968 (Cth), a predecessor of the provision presently under consideration, the meaning was that of ""identity"". Gibbs J, at 105, found support for his view in a consideration of the purpose of the legislation: This restriction is imposed to prevent persons from profiting by the acquisition of control of a company for the sole purpose of claiming its accrued losses as a tax deduction. However the restriction if imposed absolutely would lead to injustice in cases where a company, notwithstanding substantial changes in the ownership of its shares, continued to carry on the same business. No injustice would, in my opinion, result from a refusal to treat an accrued loss as a tax deduction where the company after the change carried on a different business, although one of a similar kind. Lilyvale therefore needs to show that the business it carried on after the share sale was identical to the business that it carried on in the relevant period before the share sale. 61 There was no issue as to the fact that Lilyvale was carrying on a business before the share sale. The parties do differ, however, as to their characterisation of that business. In submissions, Mr Slater QC, who appeared for Lilyvale, characterised its business, both before and after the sale, as carrying on ""the business of hotelier or innkeeper at the premises in the Rocks"". He submitted that in carrying on its business Lilyvale ""provided accommodation for guests, provided restaurant facilities and meals for guests, and food and beverages in bars and so forth, convention facilities, parking facilities, laundry facilities and all the other things that a hotel provides to its customers or guests ... with three exceptions, it employed all the staff engaged in that enterprise"". In contrast, the Commissioner submitted that Lilyvale's business consisted of the following: &#8226; the provision of the physical asset ie., the Hotel; &#8226; the maintenance of an operating bank account in the name of Lilyvale Hotel Pty Ltd in which [Enterprises Australia] deposited receipts and from which [Enterprises Australia] made payments of operating expenses, and from which Lilyvale transferred excess amounts from time to time; &#8226; the procurement of [Enterprises Australia], pursuant to the Management Agreement, to operate and manage the hotel but with a veto on capital expenditure; &#8226; the procurement of [ANA Enterprises] (later ANA Hotels), pursuant to the Licence Agreement, to allow [Enterprises Australia] to operate and manage the hotel using the trademarks associated with ANA and the ANA Hotels Systems Services."

Case16381,cited,Munn (for and on behalf of the Gungari People) v Queensland (2001) FCA 1229,"Munn v Queensland [2001] FCA 1229 Emmett J observed that the Court's deliberations on an application under s 87: ""... would include a consideration of the extent to which the State is a party, on the basis that the State, or at least a Minister of State, appears in the capacity of parens patriae to look after the interests of the community generally. The mere fact that the State was a party may not be sufficient. The Court may need to be satisfied that the State has in fact taken a real interest in the proceeding in the interests of the community generally. That may involve the Court being satisfied that the State has given appropriate consideration to the evidence that has been adduced, or intended to be adduced, in order to reach the compromise that is proposed. The Court, in my view, needs to be satisfied at least that the State, through competent legal representation, is satisfied as to the cogency of the evidence upon which the applicants rely."" The terms of the agreement between the parties are in writing, the agreement is signed by or on behalf of the parties and the agreement is filed with the Court. The parties have had the benefit of independent and competent legal representation in arriving at this agreement, the terms of the order are clear and the agreement has been produced as a result of a process of negotiation. In this matter the Northern Territory is the sole respondent party. It is clear on the evidence before me that it has taken a real and significant interest in the proceedings. Before the proposed consent orders were signed the Northern Territory had Emeritus Professor Sansom, who had also been the expert anthropologist for the Northern Territory in the Newcastle Waters matter, consider the anthropological material going to the existence of native title. Professor Sansom's queries in relation to the material initially provided in this matter were subsequently answered to his satisfaction by the applicants. Furthermore, the Northern Territory Cabinet considered the proposed consent orders and instructed the Solicitor for the Northern Territory to agree to the proposed consent determination of native title. I am therefore satisfied that the interests of the community generally have been properly considered by the Northern Territory. There can be no doubt about the jurisdiction of the Court to make the orders sought (see s 81 of the Act) and there is nothing in the agreed terms that would suggest that the power of the Court would be exceeded. The proposed order set out details of each of the matters mentioned in s 225 thus satisfying the requirements of s 94A of the Act."

Case18510,cited,Chamberlain v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1988] HCA 21 ; (1988) 164 CLR 502,"Nonetheless, as I have noted, the consent order as to costs determined the incidence of costs as between Mr Cirillo and the first to fourth respondents in respect of all issues of costs in the inquiry as to damages application. For Mr Cirillo to make the claim he now foreshadows without first seeking to have that costs order set aside constitutes, in my view, an indirect challenge to the costs order itself. It is well accepted that a consent order is as efficacious as those pronounced after a contest and can support a plea of res judicata: see Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, Res Judicata at [38]-[39] (3 rd ed, Butterworths, 1996); Chamberlain v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1988] HCA 21 ; (1988) 164 CLR 502 at 508. Though the costs order itself reflected the usual rule that costs follow the event, it represented an agreement by the parties that had both judicial sanction in relation to its subject matter and coercive authority: see Spencer Bower et al [39] (1996). For as long as that order stands I do not understand that Mr Cirillo seeks to challenge the substantive judgment of Olsson AJ given on 28 February 2003 the principle of finality embodied in the doctrine of res judicata precludes an examination of the incidence of costs, albeit indirectly, in a tort action such as foreshadowed: see Cabassi v Vila [1940] HCA 41 ; (1940) 64 CLR 130 at 139; Cachia v Westpac Financial Services Ltd [2005] NSWCA 239 at [2] ; Markisic v Department of Community Services of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] NSWCA 321 at [45] ff; see also D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 214 ALR 92 at [83] .

Accordingly, having regard to his Honour's decision and his invoking of power under O 20 r 5, the proceedings were interlocutory. 17 The power of the Court to make a rule, such as O 20 r 5, is incontestable in any event. The court has an implied or inherent power to protect its own processes from abuse and his Honour's order could be equally supported by use of those powers, as Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; 203 ALR 1 shows. Rules such as O 20 r 5 have been a part of the armoury of courts to protect themselves from vexatious and abusive claims for well over a century. There is no basis on which it could be suggested that O 20 r 5 is not a valid rule of the Court. 26 For these reasons, I am of opinion that Mr Croker has failed to make out any reason upon which an extension of time ought to be granted. I am satisfied that even if an extension of time were granted, leave to appeal would never have been granted because Cowdroy J's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to want the grant of leave, being in my opinion, undoubtedly correct. Also, no injustice, let alone substantial injustice, would result from a refusal of a leave to appeal: Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225 at 231 [29] per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ.

The first was R v Small Claims Tribunal and Homewood; Ex parte Cameron [1976] VR 427, which related to an extension of the scope of a claim for breach of contract based upon an alleged misrepresentation without the respondent to the proceedings having been given notice of the misrepresentation as the basis for that extended claim, and therefore having been extended an opportunity to meet that case. The second was Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5 ; (1943) 68 CLR 571, where there had occurred an omission, albeit inadvertent, to notify a debtor of an adjourned hearing date of a bankruptcy petition, and where an order for sequestration nevertheless was made. The third was Hoskins v Van Den-Braak (1998) 43 NSWLR 290, where a person was held entitled to have a judgment set aside unconditionally, in circumstances where the claim on which the judgment was based was not served on that person or on anyone retained on that person's behalf. The fourth was Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 ; (2003) 131 FCR 28 at [33] , where it was held that written notice of a hearing date did not reach an applicant for relief in time, and an incorrect recording of his telephone number had frustrated attempts to communicate with that person by telephone, and further that the tribunal decision-maker was unaware of the absence of notice of the hearing. As I have already observed, none of those particular cases involved the operation of a statutory scheme such as Mr Rhodes must here address."

It was to be borne in mind, however, that the Tribunal considered matters at a time different from the sentencing judge and that the Tribunal may be required to give consideration to the fact that some relevant circumstances had changed between the sentencing and the Tribunal's consideration of the matter. Moreover, so the Court said in SRT at 243, ""accepting the findings of the sentencing judge does not prevent the Tribunal from distinguishing between those findings in terms of weight""."

Case14339,considered,Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel [1999] FCA 48,"In the context of operations in overseas territories, I note at this point that the CECK partnership was successful in obtaining an export market development grant (""development grant"") under the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 (Cth) in relation to its expenditure in promoting the Travel Vision system in overseas territories in the 1994 FY. The CECK partnership and other licensees made a claim for a similar grant in relation to the 1995 FY. The claim was rejected by the Australian Trade Commission (""the Commission"") but upheld by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. On appeal by the Commission to a single Judge of this Court, the decision of the Tribunal was upheld: Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel [1999] FCA 48. On a further appeal, the Full Court of this Court set aside the decision of the single Judge and the Tribunal: Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel [1999] FCA 1399 ; (1999) 91 FCR 374. I will discuss the issues in those proceedings and their significance to the applications before me in due course. 228 The Australian Trade Commission refused the application for the grant. The Commission decision was overturned by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: Travel Vision International Pty Ltd and Australian Trade Commission AAT No 12540 [1988] AATA 11. An appeal by the Commission to a single Judge of this Court on a question of law was dismissed: Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel [1999] FCA 48. On a further appeal by the Commission to the Full Court, the appeal was allowed. The three principal issues in the appeal were as follows: 1. Whether the expenditure was incurred ""primarily and principally"" for the purpose of the possible disposition of any intellectual property rights, as s 11Z(8) requires; 2. Whether intellectual property rights if any in the software and disks passed to the applicants under the licence agreements; and 3. Whether the provisions of s 38 of the Act applied. As to the first issue, the Tribunal made the following findings: ""135. The objective purpose of these applicants in incurring the expenditure to Plutora was to provide Plutora with sufficient funds to acquit its obligations to the applicants pursuant to the agreements. That is, to promote the disposal of the licences by way of granting sub-licences. That is what the expenditure was intended to achieve .... The investment or outlay of each applicant was motivated by an expectation that in achieving the objective purpose, it would generate income, in the form of royalties. And more remotely, there was the hope that, in due course sufficient income would be generated to repay the limited recourse loans and provide a return on the original investment. Those were the objectives and motives of the applicants. As a result of entering into the agreements with Plutora the six applicants had a reasonable expectation, on the basis of the information provided to them by Mr Snow, and in Mr Fiocco's case, on the basis of advice from his accountant, that they would receive income tax relief and an export market development grant. 136. The evidence is that the directors of TVI, the consultants and Mr Martinson, at the time of their overseas promotions trips and the incurring of the expenditures in question, believed they would succeed in 'selling' sub-licences. Mr Fiocco's evidence is that he too thought that was a possibility but not without considerable risk. He saw the prospect of the financial effect of enhanced income tax deductions and an export market development grant as the incentive. That is subjectively, it was those possible consequences of making the investment which induced the applicants to enter into the arrangement. But the purpose of their investment was as stated. If the arrangement offered by TVI lacked commercial realism then it would be open to a tribunal of fact to conclude that the subjective purpose, of obtaining financial gains, through exploitation of the income tax and export market development grants laws, was dominant. On that basis the requisite purpose would not be met. However, this Tribunal finds, on the evidence, that the arrangement entered into between TVI and the applicants and Plutora and the applicants, at the time, was sufficiently commercially plausible to be considered, objectively, as a reasonable investment, the risk of which had been considerably reduced by the prospect of income tax and export grant financial benefits."""

The errors of the Tribunal include the reference to eligible service under s 9(1) when the correct test was contained in s 70(5) of the Act; the reference to 'war service' when the only service relevant was Mr Robertson's 'defence service'; the failure to refer to the correct provisions in s 70(5) of the Act; and the finding made in the absence of evidence of Mr Robertson's alcohol dependence. The Tribunal did not identify the correct issues which it was required to determine and accordingly fell into jurisdictional error: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 347-348."

In that case the defendant showed, or threatened to show, to others video footage depicting himself and the appellant, his former de facto partner, engaged in sexual activity. One of the claims was that those actions constituted the tort in Wilkinson v Downton . The appellant did not suffer psychiatric harm as a result of the threat but she did suffer severe emotional distress.

Case11041,applied,Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372,"is not a matter in which it is necessary to consider in detail the varying and by no means harmonious views that have been expressed by judges as to the burden of the ""no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting"" formula and of the nature of, and limits to, the assessment it requires be made. As I have indicated, I have a plethora of evidence before me and the principal task it presents is the making of an assessment of it, as a matter of fact, as to whether Mr Kowalski has no reasonable prospect of proving each of the facts necessary to perfect the elements of the causes of action he advances in his pleading: cf Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCAFC 176 at [41] ; see also Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 at [23] . Beyond that, as I will indicate, there is also a question whether his claims are legally untenable in any event. It is well accepted that the moving party bears the onus of persuading the Court that the applicant has no reasonable prospects of success. But once that party has established a prima facie case that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of success, the applicant must respond by pointing to specific factual or evidentiary disputes that make a trial necessary: Jefferson Ford at [127]. Importantly for present purposes, as Gordon J observed in Jefferson Ford at [130] (citations omitted): ... where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success ... So, for example, if the pleadings, affidavits, and other materials considered in connection with the summary judgment motion, reveal a factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether or not the claim succeeds, it cannot be said that the claim has ""no reasonable prospect of success"" ... On the other hand, if the factual contest is unnecessary to the resolution of the cause of action pleaded, then in the absence of other relevant material, there is nothing to prevent the court entering judgment on that claim. Breach of Trust/Fiduciary Duty Doing the best I can with the underlying material which is said to found the complaints made, and conscious of the opportunities I have given Mr Kowalski to propound a cause of action, albeit in lay terms, I have as I have foreshadowed, concluded that the proceedings should be summarily dismissed. While it will not often be the case that a Court will be required to or should properly conduct as detailed an examination of the materials put on by the parties as I have, this is not an ordinary proceeding with an ordinary and uneventful provenance. The evolving manner in which Mr Kowalski has perceived his grievances and has formulated them to secure the relief he has in mind, has necessitated that I conduct in essence a ""preliminary trial"": Jefferson Ford , at [23]. I intend to deal briefly with the factual material chronologically, focussing primarily upon those matters which have led me to my conclusion. It is, I consider, important to acknowledge that in 1992 both the insurer and the Trustee declined Mr Kowalski's formal application for a TPD Benefit. The Trustee's decision has not been challenged in this proceeding. I mention this decision because, as the Trustee later recognised, it did not preclude the further consideration of whether Mr Kowalski may have been entitled to a TPD Benefit when his employment terminated in 1994."
Case7178,applied,Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378,"The historical background and authoritative judicial interpretation of the substantial part requirement, in the context of a building design dispute, are comprehensively reviewed by Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378 at [47]-[56]. 85 Counsel for Carlisle submitted that the al fresco quadrant ""was the product of negligible or trivial skill, labour and effort"". For the reasons given in relation to the subsistence issue, I reject this submission; see Tamawood at [55]-[56]. 86 Counsel also argued that by the time the Provence was designed in 2003 the al fresco quadrant had become commonplace. However, the relevant time for assessing the ""substantial part"" question is when the Seattle was designed, that is in 1999. If that were not so, copyright owners would lose their rights provided a sufficient number of infringements had been perpetrated. 87 I find that the al fresco quadrant was a substantial part of Barrett's designs and buildings. 88 A finding of subjective copying is relevant to the issue of sufficient similarity. In Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 43 IPR 1 Lindgren J, with whom Finkelstein J agreed, said at [86] that ...where subjective copying occurs there can be expected to be found an infringement, unless it transpires that that the product is so dissimilar to the copyright work that the copyright work can no longer be seen in the work produced. Subsequently in Tamawood Wilcox and Lindgren JJ at [46] somewhat qualified that view. Their Honours noted that the primary judge in the case before them had ""expressed surprise"" at the passage from Eagle . Their Honours said: Referring to an expectation, that statement allows for exceptions. Also it must be read in context. As stated earlier in the judgment (at [72]) Eagle was better regarded as a case of reproduction of the whole of the copyright work, so it was strictly not necessary to undertake the ""substantial part"" inquiry. Eagle was a case of subjective copying of the shapes and arrangement of, and interrelationship between rooms, and of traffic flow, throughout the house. The statement which surprised his Honour is akin to that of Lord Bingham in Designers Guild Ltd v Russell William (Textiles) Ltd [[2001] FSR 11 , [2000] UKHL 58 at 116, 117] ( Designers Guild ) that: ...[w]hile the finding of copying did not in theory conclude the issue of substantiality, on the facts here [ Designers Guild was also a case of overall similarity] it was almost bound to do so. It was acknowledged several times elsewhere in the judgment in Eagle (at [69], [74] and [103], for example) that subjective copying alone is not enough, and that where a part is taken it must be a substantial part of the copyright work. (Peterson J's aphorism, ""what is worth copying is prima facie worth protecting"", a statement made in University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 at 610 in relation to the subsistence of copyright, was in fact invoked in the context of infringement and ""substantial part"" in Ladbroke by Lord Reid at 279 and by Lord Pearce at 293-294, but the House of Lords may be taken to have cautioned against this practice in Designers Guild ). 90 In Tamawood their Honours did not refer to the earlier Full Court decision in Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309. This appears to have been a ""substantial part"" case: see at [37]. In any event, the Full Court said at [28]: Further, in a case where there has been deliberate copying, the court will not look kindly on a defendant when the plaintiff seeks to establish that what has been copied is sufficiently objectively similar to the plaintiff's work. In Blackie &amp; Sons Ltd v The Lothian Book Publishing Co Pty Ltd [1921] HCA 27 ; (1921) 29 CLR 396 Starke J said at 404: It is not for the court to make the way of the taker of copyright matter easy. It is a sound principle of copyright law that the court should not allow one man to take away the result ""of another man's labour, or, in other words, his property"", unless it is satisfied that the part taken is ""so slight, and the effect upon the total composition was so small"", ""as to render the taking perfectly immaterial"", or what is much the same thing, that the part taken is an unsubstantial part. (Citations omitted.) See also S W Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems [1985] HCA 59 ; (1985) 159 CLR 466 at 484 where Wilson J referred with approval to the judgment of Street J in Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278 where his Honour acknowledged that his finding of infringement had been coloured by the unmeritorious use made by the defendant of the plaintiff's work. 95 Counsel for Carlisle relied on the proposition that the more simple, commonplace, familiar and straight forward the subject matter of a copyright work, the closer the similarity that will be required if infringement is to be found: Tamawood at [42]. He cited the well known case of Kenrick &amp; Co v Lawrence &amp; Co (1890) 25 QBD 99 at 103-104, a case which concerned the representation of a hand making the mark of a cross on a ballot paper. 96 This proposition, while undoubtedly correct, is of little assistance in the present case. Barrett's al fresco quadrant was truly original and commercially successful. Nor is it to the point, as counsel for Carlisle argued, that there are differences elsewhere between the Provence and the Barrett designs, such as in respect of the front facades. The fact that this is a ""substantial part"" case necessarily means that there are other parts of Carlisle's works in respect of which there is no allegation of copying. 97 Barrett's expert witness Dr John Cooke compared the Seattle plan to the Provence plan. He said: The rear part of the [Provence] plan, containing Kitchen, Meals, Family, Alfresco, Rumpus, Bed 2, Bed 3, Bed 4, Laundry, Bath, WC, Laundry and Pantry is essentially very similar in layout (mirror reversed) to the corresponding area in the Seattle plan, with differences in the arrangement of wet areas and angled doors to Bed 3 and Bed 4 instead of the doors at right angles to the corridor in the Seattle plan. The main difference in this part of the plans is the shape of the Kitchen and the access to the Laundry (direct from the Kitchen in the Respondent's Plan; from the bedroom corridor in the Seattle Plan). The position of the Laundry access in the Respondent's Plan has enabled the bedroom corridor to be shortened. 98 In comparing the respective houses, Dr Cooke said: The vista from the Entry in the (Carlisle house) (Photograph No 67) is closed by a recessed and top lit wall feature, whereas the corresponding vista in the Seattle (Photograph No 4) is closed by an aperture in the wall beside the Rumpus room doorway and the doorway of the Rumpus room itself. The Rumpus room doorway is visible in this vista because the rear part of the plan of the (Carlisle house) is a mirror reversed version of the Seattle plan, with the result that the Entry access leads to the Rumpus room doorway in the Seattle whereas in the (Carlisle house) the Rumpus room is to the right of the Entry access. However the spatial effects in both houses are similar. 99 He concluded: Overall, in my opinion the arrangement of the Alfresco and surrounding living areas, including the indoor/outdoor connection and the Alfresco space itself is a highly significant feature of both houses [reference to photographs] as is the organization of the circulation areas to minimize waste and maximize virtual impact."
Case6541,cited,"Marseilles Extension Railway and Land Company, In re (1885) 30 Ch D 598",is a general rule that in a proceeding by or against a liquidator the real party to the action is the company and the company's assets are responsible for the costs: In re Marseilles Extension Railway and Land Company (1885) 30 Ch D 598. Of course if the liquidator is the plaintiff he will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful defendant but has an indemnity for those costs. If this were not the rule a liquidator would be in an impossible position. He would only bring an action if it were bound to succeed. He might not resist claims brought against the company unless they were clearly hopeless. There is also the risk that good people would be deterred from taking on the responsibility of acting as a liquidator: Re Wilson Lovatt &amp; Sons Ltd [1977] 1 All ER 274.
Case14066,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri [2003] FCAFC 70 ; (2003) 126 FCR 54,"Court noted that s 198(6) imposes a duty, but it is a duty which only arises upon the occurrence of certain events or the satisfaction of certain conditions. The matters in paragraphs (a)-(d) inclusive must occur or arise before the duty arises. Furthermore, the duty is not absolute in the sense that thereafter it only arises as soon as it is reasonably practicable to remove the unlawful non-citizen. The Court noted that in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri [2003] FCAFC 70 ; (2003) 126 FCR 54 the Full Court of this Court said that there was no duty to remove an unlawful non-citizen when removal was not reasonably practicable. The Court in M38/2002 considered the meaning of the words 'reasonably practicable' and noted various dictionary definitions and statements made in the authorities. The Court expressed the view that whether the removal of an unlawful non-citizen is practicable 'seems to be largely, if not entirely, concerned with whether the removal is possible from the officer's viewpoint' (at 165[65]). The Court expressed the view that the removal of a non-citizen may be practicable in the sense of feasible, but not 'reasonably practicable' as required by s 198(6) of the Act. The Court expressed the view that practicability and reasonableness may, on occasions, operate in opposing senses.

Case3696,considered,Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88,"fact that a decision-maker may later have chosen not to apply adverse information does not bear upon whether an affected person should be afforded an opportunity to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the determination to be made. A decision-maker can only dismiss information from further consideration if it is evidently not credible, nor relevant and of little or no significance to the determination to be made (see Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 ('Applicant VEAL') at [14]-[18]). In Applicant VEAL the High Court held that procedural fairness required the Refugee Review Tribunal to inform the applicant for a protection visa of the existence of an unsolicited letter which had been forwarded to the Department in which the author made certain allegations against the appellant, and of its contents, before the Tribunal decided to affirm the refusal of the Minister's delegate to grant the appellant a protection visa. In my opinion, the primary issues in this case should be decided as follows: (a) Mr Arthur did not exceed his authority in making the findings that he did. Whilst the 'scope' of the investigation for which his contract for services dated 10 December 2007 provided could be said to limit his authority to the making of a determination in respect of a suspected breach of that part of the Code of Conduct contained in s 13(3) of the Act in respect of Mr Lohse's alleged behaviour 'in a harassing manner' towards Ms Barclay, especially given the express qualification 'In the case Ian Arthur believes there is a requirement to investigate outside of this scope it must first be discussed and approved by the Project Officer', coupled with the respondents' concession that no approval to investigate otherwise was discussed and obtained, nevertheless the limitation of the relevant 'scope' needs to be viewed in the light of Mr Arthur's formal selection of 4 December 2007 to determine, in accordance with the Secretary's Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct dated 5 December 2009, whether Mr Lohse breached the 'APS Code of Conduct' and not simply a discrete part of it. In addition, the Secretary's Procedures clearly contemplated consideration of 'details of the suspected breach of the Code of Conduct ( including any variation of those details )'. (b) Mr Arthur did fail to comply with the procedures established by the Head of the Department for the determination of whether Mr Lohse, as an APS employee, breached the Code of Conduct. Firstly, Mr Lohse was never informed of the suspected breach of the Code of Conduct, which led to Mr Arthur's appointment as the decision-maker, before the variation of those details by Mr Arthur as recorded in his letter to Mr Lohse of 22 January 2008. In my view the details of the suspected breach of the Code of Conduct as recorded in the three bullet points in paragraph 2 of the Terms of Reference, forming part of Mr Arthur's contract for services dated 10 December 2007, were details of which disclosure to Mr Lohse was mandatory (see [13] above). The Secretary's procedures (see [23] et seq) provided 'the employee must be informed of' such details (emphasis added). Whilst it was open to Mr Arthur to inform Mr Lohse of a variation of those details, as he did in his letter dated 22 January 2008, it was not sufficient to simply inform Mr Lohse of the details as varied. Mr Lohse was entitled to the details of the suspected breach which led to the appointment of Mr Arthur and also to the variation of those details, which emanated from Mr Arthur. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the mandatory requirement that Mr Lohse ' must also be given the opportunity to make an oral statement in relation to the suspected breach' (emphasis added), as stipulated in the Secretary's procedures (see [29] above), was denied to him. Whatever Mr Lohse may have said about declining to be interviewed by Mr Arthur on tape, that was clearly put to him as an alternative to his provision, in the first instance, of a written response to the details of the suspected breach of the Code of Conduct. What Step 3 in the Secretary's Procedures makes clear is that if, as here, Mr Lohse made a written statement in response to the details of the suspected breach of the Code of Conduct of which he was informed, it was obligatory that he be given an opportunity to make an oral statement in relation to the suspected breach thereafter. No such opportunity was provided. A failure to observe the Secretary's procedures as procedures established by the 'Agency Head' for determining whether an APS employee in the Agency had breached the Code of Conduct in this case constituted jurisdictional error. One can well imagine that if an APS employee in the position of Mr Lohse had an opportunity to make an oral statement in relation to the suspected breach he would be able to ensure that appropriate emphasis was given to the matters addressed in his written statement thereby ensuring that the decision-maker did not misunderstand what had been written. No doubt an oral statement would also be relevant to matters of credit which would ensure that justice was done and that matters were not simply decided on a '3 against 1' basis. Counsel for the respondents relies upon the preferred test stated by McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 390 in respect of invalidity, where a relevant provision had not been complied with. At [93] their Honours said: '... a court, determining the validity of an act done in breach of a statutory provision, may easily focus on the wrong factors if it asks itself whether compliance with the provision is mandatory or directory and, if directory, whether there has been substantial compliance with the provision. A better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid. ... In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to ""the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute"".' (Footnotes omitted) In the present case the legislation made it clear that the Agency Head's procedures for determining whether an APS employee had breached the Code of Conduct or not 'must have due regard to procedural fairness'. In the circumstances it is hardly surprising that the Secretary's Procedures for determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct provided that ' If the employee makes a written statement [within the requisite period of time] of being given the opportunity to do so, the employee must also be give the opportunity to make an oral statement in relation to the suspected breach'. The use of the expression 'must also' following the words commencing with 'if' make it clear that the opportunity to make an oral statement must be afforded after the written statement for which the procedures provide, has been made. Given the range of possible sanctions available, in circumstances where a person in the position of Mr Arthur may find that a person in the position of the applicant breached the Code of Conduct, fairness clearly required that an opportunity be afforded to Mr Lohse to make an oral statement following the making by him of his written submission to Mr Arthur on 11 March 2008 and before Mr Arthur made his determination of 30 March 2008. Given that there was no 'hearing', Mr Lohse was not invited to be present when Ms Barclay and Mr Hislop were interviewed and Mr Lohse did not have an opportunity to cross-examine them, fairness clearly required that there be a procedure such as that established by the Agency Head and further that such procedure be strictly complied with. This is not a case where earlier indications by Mr Lohse of his preference for making a written statement, as opposed to participating in an oral interview, in response to the details of the suspected breach of the Code of Conduct, of which he was informed, could be relied upon to justify refusal of the relief sought by Mr Lohse, in the exercise of the Court's discretion in that regard. (c) In my opinion procedural fairness did not require disclosure by Mr Arthur to Mr Lohse of the allegations made by Ms Barclay referable to Mrs Lane or Mrs Lane's 14 year old daughter. It is evident that Ms Barclay did not know anything about any alleged misconduct of Mr Lohse towards Mrs Lane's 14 year of daughter. She conceded as much in her interview with Mr Arthur. In relation to Mrs Lane, Ms Barclay suggested that Mrs Lane had informed her that she felt a bit uneasy with Mr Lohse, that he had 'tried to make moves' and had sent Mrs Lane 'some text messages on a trip'. Ms Barclay informed Mr Arthur that she had no knowledge as to the content of those messages. In the circumstances a failure to disclose these matters to Mr Lohse could not constitute procedural unfairness. Allegations of misconduct in dealings with Mrs Lane and her daughter which were devoid of any content could not, in my opinion, have subconsciously affected Mr Arthur's decision-making process in respect of the suspected breaches of the Code of Conduct to which he was invited to respond. However, there should in my opinion, have been a disclosure to Mr Lohse of the matters put to Mr Arthur by Ms Barclay about Mr Lohse's alleged viewing of Ms Barclay and her breasts in a 'sleazy manner' on earlier occasions. The ultimate finding of Mr Arthur in relation to a suspected contravention of s 13(3) of the Act (part of the Code of Conduct), was not that Mr Lohse behaved in a 'harassing manner' towards Ms Barclay, but rather, that he failed to treat her 'with respect and courtesy'. During the course of her interview with Mr Arthur on 21 December 2007 Ms Barclay was asked about the level of contact she had had with Mr Lohse in the five months preceding the incident. She said: '... he has the first desk within the office and as I walk in ... he looks straight up as I walk in. When I walk in, every time I feel he looks down and does this look like he's looking he looks over his glasses and looks at me, yes, in a sleazy manner, if I could say.' When asked if she might be 'over reacting' Ms Barclay said to Mr Arthur: 'No. On a couple of occasions, like when I've ... a different top ... other than a business shirt ... on one occasion I walked out of the door and he ... stood there at the door ...looked at my like, my breasts. Or, to me, he was looking at that direction.' Later Ms Barclay said in relation to her working relationship with Mr Lohse: 'He makes me feel uncomfortable'. Later she said: 'I find him creepy and I don't feel comfortable with him ...' Ms Barclay further alleged that on the evening of 7 November 2007 when Mr Lohse left the table to have a cigarette and said to female passers-by 'Here, puss, puss, puss' he: '.... was doing like, hand gestures also, like rubbing his thumb and his finger, going like downwards you know, sort of the genital area, I guess you'd say, down further.' Ms Barclay opined that members of the public viewing Mr Lohse's behaviour: '... would have thought it was disgusting and disgraceful and probably would have thought they're wasting their taxpayer's money ... if people are seeing badly behaved public servants.' When asked whether any people in the vicinity objected to Mr Lohse's alleged behaviour Ms Barclay said no more than 'I did see a couple of expressions of females ...' In my opinion the above quoted information answered the description of being credible, relevant and significant to the determinations to be made by Mr Arthur such that it would be unfair to deny Mr Lohse an opportunity to deal with it, there being a real risk of prejudice, albeit subconscious, arising from Mr Arthur's possession of the relevant information and Mr Lohse's ignorance of it. This was a classic case for the application of the principles stated in Applicant VEAL , especially in circumstances where there was no formal hearing, Mr Lohse had no opportunity to hear what Ms Barclay said to Mr Arthur at her interview on 21 December 2007 nor did he have an opportunity to test its accuracy by cross-examining her. The consequences for Mr Lohse of acceptance of Ms Barclay's untested assertions obliged Mr Arthur, acting fairly, to disclose the matters mentioned by Ms Barclay to Mr Lohse, thereby affording him an opportunity to respond to same. (d) Procedural fairness did not require Mr Arthur to make inquiries into the matters referred to at [16](d)(i)-(vi) above. There were no relevant rare or exceptional circumstances requiring Mr Arthur to make the further inquiries for which Mr Lohse contended. There was no matter that obviously required further inquiry in relation to a critical fact or facts. Had Mr Lohse wished to provide support for his claims of prior good character, it was perfectly open to him to obtain character references and attach them to his response of 11 March 2008. Similarly, if Mr Lohse was of the view that Ms Barclay and/or Mr Coloe bore ill will towards him, he could have obtained statements from others to support that suggestion and attached them to his response of 11 March 2008. (e) Much of the evidence touching upon Mr Arthur's consideration of this matter prior to the making by him of his determination on 30 March 2008 supports an inference that Mr Arthur did not bring an open mind to the determination of the issues with which he was confronted. In my opinion one cannot simply look at his ultimate reasons and work backwards from the manner in which he expressed them to an inference that he did bring an open mind to the issues. As previously mentioned Mr Arthur's more detailed summary of the particulars of the allegations against Mr Lohse of 3 March 2008 included: 'Upon completing your duties [on 7 November 2007] , the four of you gathered at the Jetty Hotel for a meal and debriefing of the day's activities.' In my opinion the applicant's submission that the word 'debriefing' was one suggested by Mr Arthur should be upheld. The first issue in the 'scope' of Mr Arthur's engagement to which he was required to adhere when conducting his investigation (see [13] above) was: '&#9679; As a threshold matter, determine if any of Mr Lohse's alleged behaviour(s) occurred while Mr Lohse was acting in the course of APS employment; ...' Not one of the four APS employees who gathered at the Jetty Hotel on 7 November 2007 suggested that the purpose of the gathering was to effect a 'debrief'. The suggestion that this was the purpose of the gathering was that of Mr Arthur who on two occasions in the course of his interview of Ms Barclay on 21 December 2007 said 'essentially, it was a debrief'. On the first occasion he raised it as a question and on the second he asserted it as conclusion. This characterisation of the gathering was in the face of Mr Coloe's, Ms Barclay's and Mr Hislop's observations. Mr Coloe said: 'After executing the warrants, seizing property and having it secured [on 7 November 2007] we returned to our accommodation [a hotel located near to the Jetty Hotel at Glenelg] . That evening the four of us went out for dinner and a few drinks. ...' In Ms Barclay's statement of 21 November 2007 she said: 'On completion of our duties [on 7 November 2007] we returned to our hotel. That evening we all met in the foyer of the hotel and walked to the Jetty Hotel for drinks and dinner. ...' In his interview of Mr Hislop on 21 December 2007 the following exchange took place with Mr Arthur: Arthur: '... I understand that that search warrant was in fact executed on the 7 th November during the day?' Hislop: 'That's right, yes.' Arthur: 'Okay. And later that evening you went somewhere for drinks.' Hislop: '... yes, we just went to a general bar [at the Jetty Hotel in Glenelg] for just down from the hotel.' After Mr Arthur, in his interview of Ms Barclay, queried whether the purpose of the gathering at the Jetty Hotel was essentially a debrief, Ms Barclay did agree. She said: '... so we spoke about the things that we'd observed in that shop. ... ... after we'd finished that warrant ... I went back to the hotel with John [Coloe] in one car and he [Mr Lohse] went back in another car with Andrew [Hislop] . So we didn't have any time of talking about what had happened during the day until we'd met up for dinner.' It was at this stage that Mr Arthur observed ' all right. So, yes, it's essentially a debrief ', to which proposition Ms Barclay assented. Given that a contravention of s 13(3) of the Code of Conduct required a finding that an 'APS employee, when acting in the course of APS employment , must treat everyone with respect and courtesy' it may be said that Mr Arthur's suggestion and subsequent confirmation of the purpose of the gathering at the Jetty Hotel demonstrated a prejudgment on a material issue before Mr Lohse was even informed of the allegations against him on 22 January 2008. Other matters arose during Mr Arthur's interview of Ms Barclay on 21 December 2007 which supported an inference that, by the time Mr Lohse first had notice of the investigation into his alleged breach of the APS Code of Conduct, Mr Arthur had a closed mind which was not open to persuasion one way or the other. Just as Mr Arthur had suggested that the dinner and drinks gathering of the four APS employees had essentially been an employment based debriefing meeting, he also suggested to Ms Barclay that Mr Coloe's reaction to what had happened when Mr Lohse presented Ms Barclay with the flower was one of 'surprise' when she had failed to articulate any matter which would justify such a conclusion. When Ms Barclay said that the alleged statement attributed to Mr Lohse about 'how I always smell good' intimidated her, Mr Arthur impliedly accepted the premise upon which the claimed intimidation was based by saying 'Yes, I can understand that'. When Ms Barclay made mention of Mrs Lane and an alleged conversation in which Mrs Lane spoke about Mr Lohse's behaviour towards Mrs Lane on some trips that they had previously made together, Mr Arthur inquired as to what sort of behaviour. Rather than allowing Ms Barclay to answer the question as to what Mrs Lane had allegedly spoken of, he suggested the word 'similar'. He then proceeded to suggest that Mr Lohse had been 'making advances' to Mrs Lane. The suggestion was embraced by Ms Barclay who agreed with it. In relation to Mr Lohse's alleged 'here puss puss puss' remark and movement of his hand, Ms Barclay said on 21 December 2007 'he just disgusted me'. Once again, it would appear that Mr Arthur accepted the premise upon which the observation was made by saying and repeating it 'I'm not doubting that'. Ms Barclay said of Mr Lohse's behaviour, ' it's not the behaviour that I am used to being around ... you know, starting in a workplace that you're on an Executive Level 2 position, I thought that ... you should be ... better behaved .' Mr Arthur responded to this proposition again indicating a seeming acceptance of the premise on which the observation had been based by saying: '... yes, I agree.' It would appear that before the interview concluded steps were taken to relocate Mr Arthur and Ms Barclay from the interview room. In this context Mr Arthur is recorded as saying: '... there is a bit more I'd like to go through. Actually, ... the remainder of this ... is fairly good. It's all good, anyway.' Rather than record that he understood the remaining matters which were addressed in Ms Barclay's statement of 21 November 2007, Mr Arthur appears to have communicated an acceptance of what had been said. In my opinion Mr Arthur did not approach the task which was entrusted to him with an open mind and he was not open to persuasion. The applicant's claim of bias has been made good. (f) Even if the evidence mentioned was not sufficiently strong to establish actual bias on the part of Mr Arthur, it was sufficient, in my opinion, to draw a conclusion of apprehended bias sufficient to constitute a denial of natural justice to Mr Lohse. In my opinion a hypothetical fair-minded lay person properly informed as to the nature of the process which Mr Arthur was engaged in and the possible sanctions which might be imposed upon Mr Lohse, might reasonably apprehend that Mr Arthur might not have brought an impartial mind to the making of his decision on alleged breaches of the APS Code of Conduct by Mr Lohse. A case of reasonable of apprehension of bias has clearly been made out. (g) In my opinion the decision of Mr Arthur as recorded in his report of 30 March 2008 was not on its face so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have made it. Whilst one could criticise Mr Arthur's approach to the proof of matters on a '3 against 1' basis rather than who was to be believed and, whilst he may have failed to approach the determination of the matter before him on a Briginshaw v Briginshaw basis (see Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336) , I am inclined to the view that there was no relevant Wednesbury unreasonableness. This of course provides no answer to the case, given the other findings going to jurisdictional error and denial of natural justice which have been made."

Case24495,referred to,Re Finance Sector Union of Australia; Ex parte Illaton Pty Ltd (1992) 6 ALJR 583,"In Livesey 151 CLR at 293-294 the High Court referred to the principle laid down in R v Watson; Ex parte Armstrong [1976] HCA 39 ; (1976) 136 CLR 248 at 258-263 as follows: 'The principle is that a judge should not sit to hear a case if in all the circumstances the parties or the public might entertain a reasonable apprehension that he might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question involved in it.' This Court has adopted such principle in relation to matters arising in reviews under the Act: see NAHD of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 214 ALR 264 at [14] per Allsop J; see also: Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; 179 ALR 425.

This principle, which has evolved from the fundamental rule of natural justice that a judicial officer should be free of bias, reflects a concern with the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. This concern is expressed in the cognate principle that, not only must justice be done, it must be seen to be done.' This principle has been repeatedly followed: see for example Re Polites: Ex parte Hoyts Corporation Pty Ltd (No 2) [1991] HCA 31 ; (1991) 173 CLR 78 at 85 and Re Finance Sector Union of Australia; Ex parte Illaton Pty Ltd (1992) 6 ALJR 583.

Case9392,applied,SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214,"The Tribunal has referred to the fact that in the period before the hearing before it the appellant did not claim that political affiliations were important. That may have been relevant to its assessment of the appellant's credit either on that particular topic, or more generally. The Tribunal did not say so in express terms. The fact that the information (assuming for the moment it is information) is used by the Tribunal in the assessment of an applicant's credit, either on a particular topic or generally, may be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision that is under review within the provisions of s 424A of the Act: SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 (' SZEEU ') per Weinberg J at 252 [158] and Allsop J at 262-263 [220]-[221]. In other words, the obligation in s 424A(1) may apply even though the information does not of itself lead to a positive factual finding but is of significance only by way of demonstrating an inconsistency with other information provided on a different occasion. 20 In the case of a challenge on the basis that it is said that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 424(1) of the Act, it is necessary for the applicant to show that in fact the information was the reason or part of the reason the Tribunal affirmed the decision that is under review. That is sometimes a difficult question to determine and I agree with Weinberg J in SZEEU (at 253 [163]) that in cases of doubt, the matter should generally be resolved in favour of the applicant. In this case, the first respondent did not argue that the obligation did not arise because the information (again, assuming it is information) was not a reason or part of a reason the Tribunal affirmed the decision that is under review. I think that it was, and I refer to the passages set out in [15] and [16] above. 21 The question whether the matter relied upon by the Tribunal in this case was information for the purposes of s 424A of the Act is a difficult one. It is possible to characterise what the Tribunal relied upon as: 1. The contrast between the information given by the appellant prior to the second Tribunal hearing and the information given by the appellant at the second Tribunal hearing. 2. The failure to mention allegations in the information given by the appellant prior to the second Tribunal hearing. 3. The inference to be drawn from the contrast between the information given by the appellant prior to the second Tribunal hearing and the information given by the appellant to the second Tribunal hearing, namely, that the appellant may not be a witness of credit either on the particular topic concerned or generally. 22 Although I accept that the matter relied upon by the Tribunal may have had an important bearing upon its conclusions, I find it difficult to characterise the matter as 'information' within s 424A of the Act. It seems to me that the matter is no more than an inference which the Tribunal drew from the way in which material, which is no doubt information, was provided to it. A number of the difficulties which arise from the use of the word 'information' in s 424A of the Act are identified and discussed by Weinberg J in SZEEU . As to the difficulties raised by a case of the present nature, I refer to his Honour's observations at 255 [176]-[178]. 23 I am inclined to think that the matter relied on by the Tribunal was not information for the purposes of s 424A , but I do not need to decide the point because even if the matter was information within the section, it falls within the exception in s 424A(3)(b). 24 The obligation in s 424A(1) does not apply to information that the appellant gave for the purpose of the application for review (s 424A(3)(b)). It is clear from the authorities that the obligation does apply to information the appellant gave prior to the application for review. In my opinion, the exception applies to information the appellant gave not only to the second Tribunal hearing but also to the first Tribunal hearing. Such information was information that the appellant gave for the purposes of his application for review to the Tribunal. In my opinion, on a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons the matter (assuming it to be information) was information the appellant gave at the first Tribunal hearing.

Case12646,cited,Mabo v State of Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1,"In Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 , O'Loughlin J considered the correct interpretation of ""a native title claim group"" in the context of an application for a determination of native title and the principle that native title is communally held ( Mabo v State of Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1 at [109] [10] per Deane and Gaudron JJ). A native title claim group is not established or recognised merely because a group of people call themselves a native title claim group ( Risk at [60]). In Risk , as here, the family that Worimi represents is, on his own evidence, only part of the group which, according to traditional laws and customs, could hold native title over the Land. Worimi accepts that the members of that group do not claim native title and concludes that they are unaware of the traditional laws and customs. 35 To prevent the making of the declaration sought by the Land Council, Worimi would need to advance a case that establishes that native title does exist or to cast doubt on the Land Council's evidence. Native title exists under the Act as a community title capable of recognition by the common law. Individual non-proprietary rights can be recognised where they are derived from the community's laws and customs and are dependent on community title ( Mabo at [52] per Brennan J). Laws and customs in which rights or interests find their origins must be laws or customs having a normative content and deriving from a body of norms or normative system, that existed before sovereignty ( Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 at [38] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ). If the normative system has not existed throughout that period, if it has not had a continuous existence and vitality, if the laws and customs cease to be acknowledged and observed by that society as a group, the rights and interests will have ceased to exist and cannot be revived or reconstituted ( Yorta Yorta at [47] [50]). It is not necessary to show that every member of a community or group has acknowledged and observed the relevant traditional laws and customs but the Act requires that a native title claimant group establish rights and interests possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by that group as a whole ( De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 at [58] ). As discussed in Hillig (No 2) at [60] [62], a sub-group that accepts that it is only part of a larger group of native title holders is not the group that holds the common or group rights within s 61 of the Act. Worimi and his family are such a sub-group."
Case13683,cited,Rivera v United States of America [2004] FCAFC 154,"More recently, in Rivera v United States of America [2004] FCAFC 154 , Heerey, Sundberg and Crennan JJ considered whether the principle in Dietrich applied to a review of extradition proceedings under s 21(1) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) ('the Act'). Their Honours firstly considered s 19(5) of the Act, which provided: 'In the proceedings, the person to whom the proceedings relate is not entitled to adduce, and the magistrate is not entitled to receive, evidence to contradict an allegation that the person has engaged in conduct constituting an extradition offence for which the surrender of the person is sought.'"
Case13641,cited,In the matter of an appeal by Gaye Alexandra Mary Luck [2003] HCA 70,"However, a complication which has not been addressed by the parties in this case is that the decision of Jarrett FM pursuant to r 13.10 Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 ('FMCR') was an interlocutory judgment. His Honour noted himself in his reasons for decision that the application brought by the second respondent was interlocutory (par 3). Further, as pointed out by the High Court of Australia in In the matter of an appeal by Gaye Alexandra Mary Luck [2003] HCA 70 at [6] : 'For more than a century, courts, including courts of the highest authority, have consistently held that an order staying an action on the ground that it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process is an interlocutory order.' 6 This principle represents the position in Australia: Luck at [8]. That decisions of Federal Magistrates pursuant to r 13.10 FMCR are interlocutory judgments is also beyond doubt, as pointed out by Lander J in Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 at [6] - [15] ."
Case1312,followed,WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 ; (2004) 80 ALD 568,WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 ; (2004) 80 ALD 568 at 573-574 [22] Lee and Moore JJ noted the principle that observance of the requirement that the review procedure be carried out according to law was an irreducible duty. They said that the tribunal only obtained power to make a determination under the Act where its decision was based on findings or inferences of the facts grounded on probative material and logical grounds. It followed that a decision based on illogical or irrational findings or inferences of fact is a decision not supported by reason and is therefore invalid.
Case17536,discussed,SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [36],"In SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 , a decision handed down on the same day as SZCKD , the Tribunal had stated in its reasons that it had the Department's file before it and had considered its contents. In his letter in support of the application for review to the Tribunal the appellant, dealing with the reasons he had left China, said ""As I explained before"" and ""I gave full explanations in my previous statement"". Rares J rejected the Minister's argument that the incorporation by this reference was of everything which the appellant had put before the delegate, and not just so much of the material as related to the events surrounding his leaving China. His Honour said (at [36]) that when it is sought to say that a person ""republished"" something which had been provided at a different time, an objective assessment is called for. After reference to the concept of objective assessment in the law of defamation, contract, trade practices and passing off, his Honour concluded that a subjective criterion could not have been intended by Parliament in the case of s 424A. His Honour noted the earlier decision of SZDMJ [2005] FCA 1034 where Gyles J held that there was a ""clear republication of original claims made in a declaration by the applicant as part of his application for review""."
Case18467,cited,Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic and Felts Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 6,"order that the First Respondent, Second Respondent and/or Third Respondent be restrained from infringing the applicant's copyright in the applicant's photographs, images and written words by reproducing (including by way of web-site) or authorising the reproduction of such photographs, images and written words or a substantial part thereof without the licence of the applicant. There was no dispute between the parties as to the principles which attend the granting of interlocutory injunctions. In a judgment recently delivered in Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic and Felts Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 6 ( Sebel's case) at paras 19-31, Foster J offers a comprehensive summary of those principles, which I gratefully adopt: THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES (INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTIONS) In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 , a majority of the High Court held that, where an interlocutory injunction is sought (inter alia) in respect of private rights, it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial and in respect of which the final relief is sought. Their Honours who comprised the majority made clear that the final relief sought need not be injunctive in nature. See [8] [21] (pp 216 220) (per Gleeson CJ); [59] to [61] (pp 231 232) (per Gaudron J); and [86] [92] (pp 239 242); [98] to [100] (pp 244 246); and [105] (p 248) (per Gummow and Hayne JJ). At [10] (p 216), Gleeson CJ also specifically cited with approval Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies , 5th edn, 1997 (pp 446 456). In his Reasons for Judgment, at [13] (p 218), Gleeson CJ expressly approved the following passage from the Reasons for Judgment of Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153: In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. These remarks of Mason ACJ which were approved by Gleeson CJ echo the observations made by the High Court in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 622 623. In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [65] (pp 81 82), when referring to the well-known passage in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 at 622 623, Gummow and Hayne JJ said: By using the phrase ""prima facie case"", their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial. That this was the sense in which the Court was referring to the notion of a prima facie case is apparent from an observation to that effect made by Kitto J in the course of argument [ [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 620]. With reference to the first inquiry, the Court continued, in a statement of central importance for this appeal [ [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 622]: How strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights [the plaintiff] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks. At [70] to [72] (pp 83 and 84), their Honours went on to explain the similarities and differences between the test expounded in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 and the test articulated in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 as follows: When Beecham and American Cyanamid are read with an understanding of the issues for determination and an appreciation of the similarity in outcome, much of the assumed disparity in principle between them loses its force. There is then no objection to the use of the phrase ""serious question"" if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question, like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham , depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham . However, a difference between this Court in Beecham and the House of Lords in American Cyanamid lies in the apparent statement by Lord Diplock that, provided the court is satisfied that the plaintiff's claim is not frivolous or vexatious, then there will be a serious question to be tried and this will be sufficient. The critical statement by his Lordship is ""[t]he court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious; in other words, that there is a serious question to be tried"" [1975] UKHL 1 ; [[1975] AC 396 at 407]. That was followed by a proposition which appears to reverse matters of onus [ [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 at 408] : So unless the material available to the court at the hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction fails to disclose that the plaintiff has any real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial, the court should go on to consider whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought. (Emphasis added.) Those statements do not accord with the doctrine in this Court as established by Beecham and should not be followed. They obscure the governing consideration that the requisite strength of the probability of ultimate success depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought. The second of these matters, the reference to practical consequences, is illustrated by the particular considerations which arise where the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction in effect would dispose of the action finally in favour of whichever party succeeded on that application [See the judgment of McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 at 535 536 and the article by Sofronoff, "" Interlocutory Injunctions Having Final Effect "", Australian Law Journal, vol 61 (1987) 341.95]. The first consideration mentioned in Beecham , the nature of the rights asserted by the plaintiff, redirects attention to the present appeal. ... The remaining questions identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; 161 CLR 148 require Sebel to show that: (a) it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (b) the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. The first of these matters involves an assessment by the Court as to whether the claimant would, in all material respects, be in as good a position if he were confined to his damages remedy, as he would be in if an injunction were granted (see the discussion of this aspect in Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies , 7th edn, 2007 at pp 383 389; at pp 397 399; and at pp 457 462). The second of these matters requires the Court to exercise a discretion. In exercising that discretion, the Court is required to assess and compare the prejudice and hardship likely to be suffered by the defendant, third persons and the public generally if an injunction is granted, with that which is likely to be suffered by the claimant if no injunction is granted. In determining this question, the Court must make an assessment of the likelihood that the final relief (if granted) will adequately compensate the claimant for the continuing breaches which will have occurred between the date of the interlocutory hearing and the date when final relief might be expected to be granted. In order to address the irreparable injury question, the balance of convenience and the balance of justice in the present case, it is necessary to consider the nature and strength of Sebel's case and the circumstances in which the respondent decided to compete with Sebel by importing the Titan chair into Australia and by promoting and selling that chair in this country. It is also necessary to consider and evaluate the impact that the grant or refusal of an injunction will have or is likely to have on third persons and the public generally. In Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at [65] and [66] (pp 41 43), Brennan CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, in a joint judgment, expressly adopted a passage from Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies (5th edn, 1997, at pp 402 403), which may be summarised as follows: (a) In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application, the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances; (b) Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case; and (c) Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive. The question is how to apply those principles to the circumstances of the present case, insofar as they have been revealed on the evidence led on the hearing of the interlocutory injunction? In a general way the proceedings might be described as a suit between two trade competitors in the market for the supply of fishing lures and associated equipment. Mr Peter Pakula, the director of Pakula Tackle, has a long association with that market. As long ago as 1987, Mr Pakula caused a business name ""Pakula Tackle"" to be registered in Sydney. He carried on business under this name until December 1999. The business embraced the design, manufacture, distribution and sale of fishing lures. The lures were for use in game fishing. Mr Pakula has deposed and it does not seem to be controversial that lures produced in the course of this business quickly became well recognised and popular within the game fishing fraternity both in Australia and worldwide. In December 1999, Mr Pakula sold his business to a company, Tailored Marine Accessories Pty Ltd (Tailored Marine). A director of that company was a Mr John Zacaropoulos whose then wife was Mrs Jennifer Zacaropoulos. The Second Respondent in these proceedings, Mr Mario Zacaropoulos, is the cousin of Mr John Zacaropoulos. Mr Mario Zacaropoulos commenced to work in the business along with his cousin John upon its acquisition by Tailored Marine from Mr Pakula. Mr Pakula continued ""for some time"" to work in that business as a ""consultant"". In or about May 2004, Mr John Zacaropoulos and wife Jennifer separated. The present Applicant, Pakula Tackle was incorporated at about the same time. Under the terms of their separation Mrs Jennifer Zacaropoulos became the sole shareholder in Pakula Tackle. I infer, although it is not completely clear on the affidavit material, that pursuant to the separation agreement Pakula Tackle succeeded to the business hitherto conducted by Tailored Marine. Mr Mario Zacaropoulos remained employed in the business, now as an employee of Pakula Tackle. Mr Pakula also continued his consultancy to the business. Over the course of his consultancy during the ownership of the business by Tailored Marine, Mr Pakula observed, so he states, a continuing deterioration in that business because of quality control, customer relations and production issues. That observation is controversial. Mr Mario Zacaropoulos has deposed to working ""tirelessly"" in the business ""promoting an increase in the profits of the business"" during the period from 2005 to 31 March 2007. Additionally, in respect of Zacatak's trade mark number 1169590, I note, as in like fashion as did Foster J in the Sebel case, that this is a registered trade mark. The Registrar must therefore have considered that this trade mark had about a distinguishing features which permitted its registration under the Trade Marks Act . The Registrar's opinion is not binding and his reasons for registering trade mark number 1169590 are not in evidence. Nonetheless, at this interlocutory stage, that Zacatak's alleged infringement arises, in part, from its use of its own registered trade mark, is not a factor which tells in favour of the grant of interlocutory injunctive relief to Pakula Tackle. For the reasons which I have given, I am not persuaded, in respect of registered mark 753420, albeit at an interlocutory stage, that Pakula Tackle has made out even a serious question to be tried. That conclusion renders strictly unnecessary for me to consider the ramifications of registered trade mark 753420 being registered to Gamefish Central, not Pakula Tackle. Section 106 of the Trade Marks Act makes provision for the assignment of a registered trade mark. Such an assignment may be made either with or without the goodwill of the business concerned in the relevant goods or services. The term ""assignment"" in relation to a trade mark is defined by s 6 of the Trade Marks Act to mean ""an assignment by act of the parties concerned"". No assignment of any of the marks pleaded is evidenced. Pakula Tackle is said to be an authorised user, but that is not the way its case is cast in the statement of claim. Further, the evidence led on its behalf to date on that subject is noteworthy for its vague generality."
Case25094,cited,Wallems Rederij A/S v Muller [1927] 2 KB 99,"McGregor (from par 27-063) traces the development of the rule. The general rule as to the measure of damage is taken to have been stated and applied in Smith v M'Guire (1858) 3 H&amp;N 554; 157 E.R. 589, and as ascertained by the calculation of: ' ... the freight to be earned, and the deduction of the expenses which the shipowner would be put to in earning it; and what the ship earned (if anything) during the period which would have been occupied in performing the voyage, ought also to be deducted.' In that case Martin B expressed some doubt as to whether the shipowner was obliged to look for employment for his ship, but McGregor regards this as being wrong ' now that the rules as to mitigation have been worked out, and the contrary view is stated in later cases ' (at 27-065). Scrutton is of a similar opinion (at Art 192, p 389 footnote 31). McGregor refers to statements in Aitken Lilburn v Ernsthausen [1894] 1 QB 773 and Wallems Rederij A/S v Muller [1927] 2 KB 99, to the effect that the shipowner is bound to search out other cargo or otherwise he would not be able to recover full damages."
Case13685,applied,McIntosh v Shashoua [1931] HCA 56 ; (1931) 46 CLR 494,"It is not clear from the Federal Magistrate's reasons if an argument was made that the respondents were obliged to accept tender of the debt. Nonetheless, his Honour noted that the law is clear that a creditor is not obliged to accept tender of the sum owed if a creditor's petition has been presented: McIntosh v Shashoua [1931] HCA 56 ; (1931) 46 CLR 494. 17 The Federal Magistrate noted that the appellant's affidavit material made much of the amendment to the description of the creditor on the creditor's petition. His Honour found that nothing turned on this amendment. He said: ""The [respondent] has at all times been a partnership and has sued as such. The fact that the partnership is constituted by two individuals is wholly irrelevant to its existence as what the [appellant] described as 'a juristic person'."" His Honour also found that, contrary to the appellant's assertion, Mr Velos has always had the requisite authority to sue on behalf of the firm, and that Mr Velos and Mr Davis, the respondents, jointly agreed to commence the proceedings against the appellant. 18 The Federal Magistrate recorded that the appellant deposed to owning a property at Olinda Street worth $55,000 ""plus or minus 4 year unencumbered title"". He assumed, perhaps somewhat generously, that this meant that the appellant claimed that he owned this property unencumbered. The appellant also deposed to owning shares worth $1,000 and cash of $15,000 as well as having ""family and friends dollars? a phone call away"" and various other assets. His Honour said the appellant had made no endeavours to obtain funds from family and friends. His Honour noted evidence filed by the respondents showing that the appellant does not own registered land in Victoria but was prepared to assume, again generously, that ""in some prima facie inexplicable way he may have an interest in land of some sort"". 19 There was further evidence about the Olinda Street property. It suggested that the property was situated in Beaufort and that the appellant purchased it for $6,000 in 2002. He thereafter built a property on the land and has offered it for sale with an asking price of $75,000. However, a likely realisable purchase price is between $65,000 and $70,000, as recorded on the Real Estate Institute of Victoria exclusive sale authority. Further evidence, in the form of a flyer from a real estate agent, suggested that the construction of the property has not proceeded beyond the laying of foundations. 20 The appellant's wife swore an unchallenged affidavit in which she said that ""the land has a proposed plan of subdivision with a minimum completed value of $250,000"". The Federal Magistrate said of this affidavit that its style ""suggests very strongly that its author was in fact the [appellant] himself"". 21 The final piece of evidence concerning the Olinda Street property is the attribution by the relevant shire of $13,000 as the capital improved value of the property, and $13,000 as to the site value. The Federal Magistrate said that this probably suggests that the council valued the property at $26,000. He did not make a finding that the property was actually worth $26,000. 22 The Federal Magistrate found that ""there is nothing in the material put forward by the [appellant] that enables the Court to form any view as to the true value of the Olinda Street property, whether subdivided or in its current state."" He also found that the council valuation did not go to ""establish to the Court's satisfaction what the true value of the property is."" 56 Ground 6 appears to allege that the appellant offered a second tender of the debt on 10 August 2006 at the hearing before the Registrar. It states that ""hearsay led Registrar Mussett to make a sequestration order against the appellant. The dubious methodology adopted, distorts. The purpose alleged was to prove or disprove solvency. The essential requirements of the Act a contrary purpose was intended in bankruptcy law and the claim of McIntosh v Shashoua, 76 years ago is that, THAT case, is not THIS case."" 57 The last sentence of this ground is entirely incomprehensible. I think what the remainder of the ground alleges is that the appellant again tendered payment of the debt on 10 August 2006, not for the purpose of having the tender accepted but rather to demonstrate that he was solvent. Even if I assume, in the absence of any evidence, that the appellant did tender payment again on 10 August 2006, this ground is still flawed. The tender of a cheque in the amount of the debt owed to one creditor does not prove solvency. There is no indication of the provenance of the funds. It is entirely possible that payment of the debt owed to the respondents would have led to both a reduction of the appellant's liabilities and a corresponding reduction in his assets. If that is the case, his overall solvency is not altered. Furthermore, insolvency consists of an inability to pay all of one's debts as and when they fall due. The ability to pay one debt is not evidence of an ability to pay the others. This ground fails. 58 Ground 7 states: ""The appellant claims that the Constitution assumes the rule of law. It is defeated by the passive discourse content and prestige bias in the judgment of Burchardt FM."""
Case8372,cited,O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners (1983) 153 CLR 1,"already noted, s 68 of the Judiciary Act must be read subject to the Constitution : s 15A Acts Interpretation Act . While that provision of the Acts Interpretation Act has a purpose in preserving statutory provisions from invalidity by promoting their construction so as to accord with the limits of constitutional legislative competence, it also serves as a reminder that Commonwealth legislation ought not be construed in a way which ignores constitutionally permissible practices in the discharge of the business of the Executive Government. R v Judd [1919] HCA 9 ; (1919) 26 CLR 168 , O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners (1983) 153 CLR 1 , Attorney-General (Cth) v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582 , Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All E R 560 and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Doody [1993] QB 157 each offer an example of ways in which such practices have been taken into account by the courts in the construction of legislation and with regard to the validity of the exercise of powers by public officials. It is useful also to recall the following observations made by Gleeson CJ in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391 at 403, [15] [16] with respect to the provisions in the Constitution concerning the Executive Government of the Commonwealth: For the framers of the Constitution to have descended into greater specificity would have imposed an unnecessary and inappropriate degree of inflexibility upon constitutional arrangements that need to be capable of development and adaptability. The deliberate lack of specificity is demonstrated by the absence of any reference to such prominent features of our system of democratic government as the office of Prime Minister, or the Cabinet. The concept of administration of departments of State, appearing in s 64 , is not further defined. This is hardly surprising. The practices and conventions which promote efficient and effective government administration alter over time, and need to be able to respond to changes in circumstances and in theory."
Case18185,referred to,GT Corporation Pty Ltd v Amare Safety Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 123,"The starting point is the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (""Evidence Act""), the provisions of which, at least insofar as legal professional privilege (or, more accurately, ""client legal privilege"") is concerned, apply where, as here, evidence is sought to be adduced. The respondents did not address directly the operation of the Evidence Act and I was taken, in argument, to cases where the common law was the applicable law either because of the jurisdiction or because of the pre-trial (discovery and production) context in which the issue of privilege arose ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1; Bennett v Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101; Secretary to the Department of Justice v Osland [2007] VSCA 96 ; GT Corporation Pty Ltd v Amare Safety Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 123). Whatever assistance I may derive from those cases, it is clear that my starting point must be the provisions of the Evidence Act . Equally, the applicant did not articulate precisely the legal basis for his submission that the privilege had been waived, although I understood his submission to be based upon the disclosure to him of the unedited copy of the memorandum by the respondents' solicitors."
Case14812,cited,Air Caledonie International v The Commonwealth [1988] HCA 61 ; (1988) 165 CLR 462,"There is also good reason not to imply any such intention. In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Brown [1958] HCA 2 ; (1957-1958) 100 CLR 32 , at 40-41 Dixon CJ noted, albeit as he acknowledged without at the time a judicial decision to that effect, that it was generally assumed that "" under the Constitution liability for tax could not be imposed upon a subject without leaving open to him some judicial process by which he could show that he was not taxable or not taxable in the sum assessed "". As Dawson J later noted in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1994-1995) 183 CLR 168 , at 222, the general assumption to which Sir Owen Dixon referred did receive later judicial recognition: (His Honour referred to MacCormick v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1984] HCA 20 ; (1984) 158 CLR 622 ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Truhold Benefit Pty. Ltd. [1985] HCA 36 ; (1985) 158 CLR 678 at 684 ; Air Caledonie International v The Commonwealth [1988] HCA 61 ; (1988) 165 CLR 462 at 467). Section 14ZZN of the TAA therefore serves the important constitutional end of expressly providing for recourse by the person affected to the judicial power of the Commonwealth for a challenge to an administratively assessed taxation liability. Section 15A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) counsels that Acts should be read and construed subject to the Constitution and so as not to exceed Commonwealth legislative power. Section 14ZZN provides for a fixed time limit within which to engage this constitutionally necessary right of challenge. In the face of language that did not expressly forbid the practice and whose language was broad enough on its face to permit it, it would be a strong thing to discern by implication a prohibition as to joinder which would foreclose by a technicality of form such an important and necessary right."
Case15222,referred to,Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd v Cheung (1990) 17 IPR 69,"Various methods of measuring damages for an infringement of copyright have been described in the cases. In Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd v Caxton Publishing Co Ltd [1936] 1 Ch 323 at 336, Lord Wright MR said that the measure of damages in a copyright case ""is the depreciation caused by the infringement to the value of the copyright as a chose in action"". However, the authorities make it clear that is only one method of measuring damages: Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd v Cheung (1990) 17 IPR 69 ; Bailey 53 FCR at 111-112; Milpurrurru v Indofurn Pty Ltd (1994) 54 FCR 240. Another method is to determine the licence fee or royalty the infringing party would have to pay to use the work lawfully. There are difficulties in applying that approach in circumstances where it cannot be inferred that the infringing party would pay a licence fee rather than not use the work ( Autodesk 17 IPR at 75). The applicant did not contend that either of the aforesaid methods was appropriate in this case. It submitted that this was a case in which it was appropriate to treat the damages as being at large and to approach the assessment of damages as a jury would ( Fenning Film Service Ltd v Wolverhampton, Walsall and District Cinemas Ltd [1914] 3 KB 1171 at 1174 per Horridge J). I think that is the proper approach in the circumstances of this case."

The case also concerned events in Nepal. Having regard to the inquisitorial role of the Tribunal and its statutory function, the rejection of the evidence of a witness as to the statements made to the witness by her relative, on the sole ground identified by the Tribunal, reflected error."
Case7220,cited,Natural Waters of Viti Limited v Dayals (Fiji) Artesian Waters Limited (2007) 71 IPR 571,"The evidence necessary or sufficient to establish reputation to found a case for passing off and contravention of the TPA will depend upon various factors (see eg Natural Waters of Viti Limited v Dayals (Fiji) Artesian Waters Limited (2007) 71 IPR 571 at [58]-[59]). Reputation may be inferred from a high volume of sales and extensive advertising, without any other direct evidence (see in a different context, Kenny J in McCormick &amp; Company Inc v McCormick [2000] FCA 1335 ; (2000) 51 IPR 102 at [86] - [88] . In this proceeding, there are no sales or direct advertising or promotion of Hansen's product in Australia. Rather, the evidence relied upon is that of exposure to persons in Australia through the marketing strategy adopted by Hansen to reach its target demographic primarily in other countries. 79 No expert evidence concerning the reputation of Hansen's product in Australia, nor any survey evidence as to the reputation in and public recognition of the Hansen product in Australia, was sought to be led by any party, although such evidence would be potentially admissible: see Natural Waters (2007) 71 IPR at [30]. 80 As I have said, reliance has been placed by Hansen upon a strategy 'to lay a foundation' in Australia (for instance) before the Hansen product is launched. Whilst the young male adult is accepted as the target market or the main potential customer, the initial focus of the strategy is upon those who are involved in or watch extreme sports, which sports have an international focus and appeal. No direct evidence has been led as to the number of persons who fall within the potential extreme sports target customers, nor as to the number of persons who fall within the potential young male adult target customers, although there is some indication on the evidence tendered by Bickfords that there were some 1.01 million males in Australia aged between 18 and 24 over the relevant period. The Court has been asked not only to accept that the strategy of targeting extreme sports has been successful but, more importantly, has extended to the potential young male adult customers that are the potential target market through the technique of 'word of mouth' marketing described previously. I am not persuaded on the evidence that over the relevant period the foundation laid has reached the level of establishing the required reputation in the Hansen mark in Australia. 81 In this proceeding, I have taken into account not only the number of references to the get-up of Hansen's product, but also the context in which they appear, so as to evaluate properly the evidence presented and the effect it may have on the potential customers targeted, namely young male adults. Where, as in this proceeding, the get-up is striking and distinct, a reputation may be more readily and quickly obtained, but the Court cannot assume this has occurred in a market where the product has not been sold or directly advertised. It may be that in these circumstances potential customers will not necessarily associate any get-up, packaging, or design with the Hansen product. It will all depend upon the extent of the customers' own interests (say in a particular extreme sport) and his or her own previous exposure to the product."

Case6691,considered,Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 27 ; (2000) 22 WAR 101,"had known Huston for a number of years prior to this. Huston acted as solicitor for Anaconda Nickel Ltd in proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia culminating in an appeal to the Full Court: Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 27 ; (2000) 22 WAR 101. These proceedings concerned the enforceability of a short letter said to be a ""heads of agreement"". In certain respects it bears a remarkable similarity to the framework agreements. The majority (Ipp J; Pidgeon J agreeing) held that the heads of agreement was a valid and binding agreement. Huston helped prepare the draft as well as the final 8 November Letter concerning the three framework agreements provided by FMG to the ASX that day. He attended a meeting with Mr Tony Walsh, Assistant Manager Issuers of the ASX, on 8 November 2004 relevantly to discuss this draft for the purpose of providing further information to the ASX as to the terms of the framework agreements. I have concluded that, for this purpose, Huston would have considered the terms of the related 5 November Letter and the three framework agreements referred to in that letter. He did not advise the FMG Board or Forrest that these agreements were not legally binding or that the 5 November Letter was to that extent incorrect or not reasonably based. Given his role in FMG, had he formed that view, I find that he should have and would have informed the board. That he did not, entitled the board and Forrest to continue to regard the disclosures concerning the legal effect of the framework agreements as correct, or at least that they were reasonably based. That this was so is fortified by evidence of actual advice given by Huston to the FMG board that the framework agreements were legally binding as disclosed. The FMG board minutes of its 22 January 2005 meeting, attended by Huston, record his advice to the board that the CMCC Framework Agreement was binding. So too did an email sent by him on 30 March 2005 to Forrest, Christopher Catlow, David Liu, Rowley, Alan Watling and other FMG executives concerning the AFR Article in which he repeated this advice, relying in particular upon the Anaconda decision. The 30 March 2005 email was not disclosed in ASIC's pleading. While the minutes of the 22 January board meeting were set out as a particular of two allegations concerning FMG's and Forrest's knowledge of the Chinese Contractors' attitude towards the framework agreements and of the legal effect of the agreements, ASIC did not particularise the material passage in the minutes where Huston's legal advice to the board was set out, nor did it refer to this passage in its opening or closing submissions. This is so, despite the fact that, in relation to ASIC's s 674 case, it asserted, amongst other things, that FMG ought to have been aware of the legal effect of the framework agreements asserted by ASIC by first obtaining competent legal advice. Huston was a very experienced and competent commercial solicitor. I was not referred to these documents during the trial until the closing address by Forrest's senior counsel, Mr Myers QC. Their content, combined with other evidence, demonstrates that there was no basis for ASIC to assert dishonesty on the part of FMG, its board and in particular, Forrest. I make the same criticism of the description applied to FMG and by implication its board and particularly Forrest in the way ASIC's case was opened. It was asserted that FMG engaged in a concerted and designed course of conduct in which it made false, misleading and exaggerated statements to the ASX of which Forrest was the architect. In my view the evidence does not support such serious allegations. The principal basis, it seems, depends on ASIC's submission that the framework agreements are self-evidently not binding build and transfer agreements. I rejected that argument. I consider that there was a reasonable basis for FMG, through its board, including Forrest, to have held the view that the framework agreements were binding as claimed. It was supported by Huston's professional oversight to ensure the legal enforceability of FMG's agreements as well as his later positive advice to the effect that they were such. It was a view consistent with Forrest's knowledge of the Anaconda case. It finds arguable support in other authority. Significantly too, CREC approved the terms of the 23 August Media Release before FMG made the notifications to the ASX on 23 August 2004. The release described the CREC Framework Agreement as a ""binding agreement to build and finance the railway component of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd's $1.85 billion Pilbara iron ore project"". In the release Mr Qin Jiaming (Qin), the President of CREC, is quoted as saying that the contract presented an excellent opportunity for CREC to develop internationally and that CREC was fully confident about its capacity to build the rail project. It was described by him as a 'marriage' immediately following the high level ceremony when the parties signed the Joint Statement which rendered the agreement binding. I find that the terms of the 5 November Media Release provided to CHEC and CMCC was likewise approved, at least not disavowed, by them before disclosure to the ASX by FMG. For at least these reasons, it is important that allegations of dishonesty should be made only where there is a reasonable evidentiary basis for them. It is my opinion that on the totality of the evidence available to ASIC there was no such basis in this case. Notwithstanding that ASIC's assertions as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements differs from that disclosed by FMG to the knowledge of Forrest, this difference, which, in effect, is a difference of opinion does not of itself provide a basis for alleging dishonesty against FMG, its board and in particular Forrest. FMG's opinion was underpinned by the oversight and advice of its in-house counsel Huston. Forrest had his knowledge and experience in Anaconda to draw upon . Documents demonstrating these significant matters were available to ASIC. In light of these it is difficult to discern why ASIC ran a case alleging that FMG's board could not have made the disclosures it did if it had obtained competent legal advice. The board of FMG had no reason to doubt the correctness of Huston's view as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements. He was employed by FMG primarily to ensure that all of FMG's agreements were legally enforceable. The reasonableness of FMG's opinion was strongly contended for by senior counsel for both FMG and Forrest at trial. It was an opinion which I consider was reasonably open. In my view, these allegations of dishonesty should not have been made. I have no hesitation in concluding that FMG and its board, including Forrest, honestly and reasonably held the opinion that the framework agreements were legally enforceable in the sense asserted in FMG's disclosures. They did not hold the opinions propounded by ASIC. Those opinions do not self evidently and obviously arise upon a consideration of the terms of the framework agreements. PART 3: EVIDENTIARY MATTERS Standard of proof ASIC submits in written closing submission that the authorities such as Anaconda, Pagnan SpA, Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 540 and Uranium Equities v Fewster [2008] WASCA 33 ; (2008) 36 WAR 97 relied on by FMG state that whether or not the parties intended to contract, they must agree on such terms, normally described as essential terms, such that the contract could be enforced or made complete by implying terms or applying considerations of reasonableness. I will consider these authorities further. In Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 , the Court of Appeal found that a binding contract had been made when a heads of agreement containing five clauses was signed, the last paragraph of which said that the heads of agreement ""constituted an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form"". At [28], Ipp J referred to the following statement by Sugerman J, approved by Menzies J in Thorby v Goldberg [1964] HCA 41 ; (1964) 112 CLR 597 at 607: It is a first principle of the law of contracts that there can be no binding and enforceable obligation unless the terms of the bargain, or at least its essential and critical terms, have been agreed upon. So, there is no concluded contract where an essential or critical term is expressly left to be settled by future agreement of the parties. Again, there is no binding contract where the language used is so obscure and incapable of any precise or definite meaning that the court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intentions. In Uranium Equities [2008] WASCA 33 ; 36 WAR 97 , the parties to the putative agreement had been negotiating over a proposed mining joint venture, but no heads of agreement had been executed. The Court found that the trial judge was right in concluding that the parties did not intend to be bound by anything said or done by them until such time as the heads of agreement had been executed. The Court went on to state on the question of uncertainty at [257] that it is ""trite"" that, even when the requisite intention is present, a contract can fail for uncertainty. The Court said it is also trite that only the omission of an essential term will have the effect that a contract is so incomplete or uncertain as to render it invalid, citing Ipp J in Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 at [29] . The Court referred to the statement of Lloyd LJ from Pagnan SpA [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 619 and found that when regard was had to all the circumstances the parties did not intend to be bound by anything said or done by them until such time as the heads of agreement had been executed . The Court concluded that although some of the matters left over by the parties for future negotiation were important, none were essential to the efficacy of the alleged agreement in the sense that the agreement could not be enforced without it. ASIC also points to the absence of the following from the framework agreements: no provision for choice of contractors or the selection of materials; no definition of ""practical completion""; and no specifications for any design elements of the infrastructure. The documents referred to in the Recitals to each agreement would have, no doubt, assisted in clarifying the matters absent from the agreements. In light of those documents, following the approach of Ipp J in Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 at [61] , it may have been possible to conclude that, despite the long list of matters said to render the framework agreements uncertain and incomplete, there was a binding contract, workable by implying terms or on the proper construction of the agreement. The court will apply orthodox principles of implying terms by reference to the implied duty to co-operate and use considerations of reasonableness, to give effect to that intention: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games 18 NSWLR 540; Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd v Hebron Park Pty Ltd [2009] QCA 60. The asserted uncertainty or incompleteness may therefore be overcome once the requisite intention to contract is found to be present. In Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 , the issue was whether a binding contract for Anaconda, a company interested in lateritic nickel, to explore and mine for base metals on the tenements of Tarmoola, a company interested mainly in gold, had been made when a heads of agreement containing five clauses was signed, the last paragraph of which said that the heads of agreement ' constitutes an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form' . Tarmoola argued that there was no intention to contract, no agreement on essential terms, and that the agreement was incomplete and uncertain. By majority, the WA Full Court rejected these arguments and held that the heads of agreement was a binding contract. Ipp J (with whom Pidgeon J agreed) found that contractual intention was present. His Honour endorsed the existence of the fourth Masters v Cameron category in stating: It is well recognised that parties may enter into a valid contract containing a limited number of terms comprising those terms essential to the bargain that they wish to conclude, in the expectation that at a later date a further contract will be arrived at containing additional terms that would facilitate and clarify the initial contract. That is to say, a binding contract may be arrived at even though it leaves unresolved many matters which might arise in future. [25] Since Anaconda was decided by the Court of Appeal on 17 February 2000 it has been cited, considered or applied without disapproval in a number of contract law cases involving questions of incompleteness or uncertainty, for example: Duskwood Pty Ltd v Bellara Willows Pty Ltd [2001] per Steytler J at [95]; Liristis Holdings Pty Ltd v Wallville Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 428 per Barrett J at [38]; African Minerals Limited v Pan Palladium Limited [2003] NSWSC 268 per Einstein J at [26]; Thompson v White &amp; Ors [2006] NSWCA 350 per Tobias JA with whom Ipp and McColl JJA agreed at [100]; Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair [2008] NSWCA 248 per Giles JA with whom McColl JA and Young CJ in EQ agreed at [27]-[28]; Donald Fin Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd (2008) 67 ACSR 219 per Edmonds J at [131]-[132]; Strzelecki Holdings Pty Ltd v Cable Sands Pty Ltd [No 3] [2009] WASC 352 per Murray J at [90]. The approach taken in G R Securities 40 NSWLR 631, Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 and Tasman Capital [2008] NSWCA 248 was followed very recently by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Moffat Property Development Group [2009] QCA 60 , mentioned above, which underlined the importance of the parties' manifest intention to contract. The issue was whether a contract for the sale of rural residential land had been made by an exchange of letters. The Queensland Court of Appeal held that the parties intended to be legally bound through their exchange of correspondence and that there was a contract even though matters such as the timing of completion and arrangements at settlement, the precise timing of the payment of the deposit, the place of settlement, responsibility for insurance, GST issues and the terms of a put and call option were not spelt out in the correspondence. Keane JA delivered the court's judgment. His Honour: (a) accepted McHugh JA's point in G R Securities that ""the decisive issue is always the intention of the parties"": [23]-[25]; (b) said ""the terms of the correspondence exchanged between the parties contemplated the execution of a further contract as the means whereby the bargain which they had concluded would be implemented. It is necessarily implicit in such an agreement that the parties will co-operate to do what must be done to make the further agreement"": [30]; (c) adopted McHugh JA's approach in G R Securities and explained that the implied obligation of each party to co-operate with the other to ensure each side obtains the benefit of its bargain serves to supply the deficiencies: [34]; (d) cited Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games 18 NSWLR at 548 in stating: ""I am of the view that there can be no doubt as to the orthodoxy of referring to 'implied terms or ... considerations of reasonableness' in order to determine whether the parties' 'consensus is sufficiently comprehensive to be legally binding : [51]. Forrest had known Huston for a number of years prior to this. Huston acted as solicitor for Anaconda Nickel Ltd in proceedings against Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd in the Supreme Court of Western Australia: [2000] WASCA 27 ; (2000) 22 WAR 101. These concerned the enforceability of a short letter said to be a ""heads of agreement"". In certain respects it bears a remarkable similarity to the framework agreements. The then Full Court, in 2000, by majority (Ipp J; Pidgeon J agreeing) held that the heads of agreement was a valid and binding agreement. The judgment in that case was the foundation of the view held and the advice given by Huston. It was a case which was already well-known to Forrest. He had been Anaconda's CEO at the time of the litigation and its signatory to the heads of agreement which was the subject matter in the case. FMG and Forrest in particular, at least from the beginning of Oct 2004, if not before, were focused on ensuring that FMG's agreements were legally enforceable. This included the framework agreements. It is apparent that one of Huston's principal roles at FMG was to oversee and ensure the legal enforceability or, as Forrest sometimes described it, the ""bankability"" of FMG's agreements. On 3 October 2004 Forrest distributed a lengthy email to, amongst others, FMG executives and Huston in which he welcomed Huston to the team. Paragraph 3 with the heading ""Legally binding contracts"" included the following : Some agreements have been written in an ad hoc way with the best means available to the executive responsible. Unfortunately, on a full Bankers legal due diligence some of these may not pass the enforceability test. Gentlemen, please ensure with Peter complete legal enforceability on the agreements that we are all relying to construct FMG. The text of the email, almost entirely, concerns the three framework agreements. In context, therefore, I take this request by Forrest to be referring to, or at least to include, those agreements. Forrest concluded by saying ""... I am happy with the release, subject to P. Huston's sign off on the enforceability, to go."" This appears to be a reference to a press release concerning an iron ore contract with a Chinese company called Hebei. It again evidences Forrest's quite specific concern that FMG's agreements were legally enforceable. On 20 October 2004, after the execution of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements but before the formal Joint Statement signing ceremony in Beijing on 5 November 2004 when those agreements became binding, Forrest sent an email to various FMG personnel, including Huston, where he referred approvingly to David Liu and his co-ordination of the arrangements with the three Chinese Contractors. He also thanked Huston for his contribution. He said: Peter, (Huston) thanks for the rappid (sic) fire support tonight. Hope we got your instructions right these contract (sic) better be bankable because people are signing them. David pls get the two we worked on today down to Peter for his all clear. I take the word ""bankable"" in this context to mean such as to satisfy potential FMG financiers, in the course of their due diligence process, as to the ""legal enforceability"" of these contracts. It is clear from the combination of the 22 January minutes and Huston's 30 March email that, in his opinion, the CMCC Framework Agreement was a binding build and transfer agreement. The case to which he referred was Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 which I have referred to previously. That case concerned the enforceability of a letter containing 5 clauses and described as a ""heads of agreement"" signed by Forrest who then was Chief Executive of Anaconda. The letter concluded, in terms not dissimilar to clause 7 in each of the framework agreements: The above forms a heads of agreement which constitutes an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form. The respondent, Tarmoola, signed the letter confirming its agreement to the tems and conditions set out in it. The parties then entered into negotiations for the ""fuller agreement"" but those negotiations were unsuccessful. No ""fuller agreement' was concluded. Anaconda , amongst other relief, sought a declaration that the heads of agreement was a valid and binding contract. The respondent argued that it was not so bound on a number of bases, including lack of intention to create a binding legal relationship because so many important matters had been omitted, lack of certainty and completeness of the contract. The appeal was successful and the declaration was granted. Tarmoola's application to the High Court for special leave to appeal (P15/2000) was discontinued. Huston , I infer, during the period he was overseeing FMG's agreements, had a detailed knowledge of this case and the reasons for judgment. He was Anaconda's instructing solicitor in that case. As ASIC pleads, Huston was an experienced and practising commercial solicitor. He had, as I have said, been directly involved in preparing the 8 November Letter which concerned all three framework agreements. One of Huston's principal responsibilities was to ensure that FMG's agreements were legally enforceable. He had not suggested to the FMG Board, including Forrest, that the framework agreements were not legally enforceable. His opinion expressed in the 22 January 2005 board minutes and the 30 March 2005 email that the CMCC Framework Agreement was binding necessarily must have applied to the other two framework agreements. FMG's and Forrest's opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements was shaped and informed by Huston's involvement. They had the benefit of his dedicated professional oversight and later his advice as to the legal enforceability of the framework agreements. Forrest as CEO, was directly involved in the Anaconda case and would have been well aware of the judgments both at first instance and on appeal as well as the discontinuance of Tarmoola's application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. Forrest then had the benefit of legal advice in relation to the legal enforceability of a similar agreement. Huston alluded to this in his 30 March 2005 email when he stated, referring to the Anaconda decision: Thus if journalist(s) want to know why Andrew (Forrest) considers the (C)MCC agreement to be binding he is amongst other things relying on his own direct experience from this (S)upreme Court Case. All relevant FMG staff had been told by Forrest in early October to ensure, through Huston, that FMG agreements were legally enforceable. The evidence also demonstrates that, contrary to ASIC's assertion, Huston did give legal advice to FMG as to the legal enforceability of the framework agreements. In particular, the 22 January minutes show that the FMG board turned its mind to the question of whether the CMCC Framework Agreement was binding following the statement by Mr Ma at the 17 January meeting, that it sought legal advice on that question from Huston and that he answered the question in the affirmative. If, as I think likely, although I make no finding, he was asked to advise on the issue of the legal enforceability of the CREC Framework Agreement prior to the 23 August notification, it is reasonable to infer that his opinion and reasons for it were, or would have been, the same as he later twice provided to FMG's board. I consider that Forrest exercised his powers and discharged his duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were a director or officer of FMG in FMG's circumstances; and if they occupied the offices of Forrest within FMG and had the same responsibilities within FMG as Forrest. Forrest, as I have explained earlier in detail, as a consequence of his own appreciation of the decision in Anaconda; his reliance on the legal oversight and advice of Huston; and his appreciation that the Chinese Contractors held the same view that the framework agreements were legally binding, had reasonable grounds for approving or permitting to be made the disclosures, complained of by ASIC, by FMG between August 2004 and March 2005. I am well satisfied that Forrest acted reasonably to ensure that FMG both complied with s 674 of the Act and did not contravene s 1041H of the Act. He did not breach s 180(1) of the Act as alleged by ASIC or at all. Given the conclusions to which I have come concerning ASIC's case under s 1041H I do not consider it necessary to deal with Forrest's further defence based in s 180(2) concerning the Business judgment rule. For all these reasons ASIC's Application against each of the defendants should be dismissed. ASIC should pay the costs of each of the defendants. There will be orders accordingly.

This in essence is the same argument as that put by the applicant in Re Skyring's Application [No. 2] (1985) 59 ALJR 561, which was rejected by Deane J. His judgment was confirmed on appeal by the Full Court. ... The matter was concluded, in the view of the Court, by s 51(xii) and (xiii) of the Constitution and s 36(1) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth). It would, in my view, be an abuse of process to allow the applicant to re-litigate a matter which has already been decided adversely to him'. (Mason J at pp 618 and 619)."

The respondents say that the appellants cannot succeed in the claim against Mr Strahley based upon s 75B of the Act because the relevant integers were not properly pleaded and thus the claim failed at the threshold. The respondents say the appellants failed to formulate a case which met the requirements of the section as understood and explained in Yorke &amp; Anor v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 per Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ and Quinlivan v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2004) 160 FCR 1 per Heerey, Sundberg and Dowsett JJ.

Case19164,considered,Turner v General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd [1929] HCA 22 ; (1929) 42 CLR 352,"I am persuaded that it is appropriate for an order to be made restraining the respondent from using the name ""Chatswood BBQ King"" as the name of, or otherwise in connection with, the respondent's restaurant. However, I am not persuaded that the restraint should extend to the use of the individual words and phrases ""BBQ King"", ""BBQ Kings"", ""BBQ"", ""King"" and ""Kings"". Rather, in my view, the appropriate approach is that exemplified by the injunction ultimately made in Turner v General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd [1929] HCA 22 ; (1929) 42 CLR 352 which was discussed in Commodore Business Machines Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 92 ALR 563 at 575. In Turner v General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd the defendants were restrained ""from using the words 'General Motor', or 'General Motors' in connection with any business then or thereafter carried on by them or any of them without clearly distinguishing such business from the business carried on by General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd and from using any name calculated to lead persons to believe that the said business or businesses or any business of the defendants was or were identical or connected with the business of the plaintiff and also from representing or holding out to the like effect"".

Case3253,cited,WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399,"has been further observed that "" [t]he discretion to extend time is given for the purpose of enabling the court to do justice between the parties "": WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at [7] per Lee, Nicholson and Finkelstein JJ. The discretion to grant an extension of time is obviously not confined to those circumstances in which an appeal would thereafter succeed. An extension may be granted where, to do justice between the parties, the Court should consider and resolve a case on its merits rather than resolving it by reference to a failure to comply with a procedural requirement. In circumstances such as the present, where it is considered that an applicant seeking an extension of time has a case of some merit, where the extent of the delay is minimal and where no prejudice has been occasioned to the respondent, an extension of time should normally be granted. In the present proceeding, an extension of time is granted pursuant to O 52 r 15(2) extending the time within which a Notice of Appeal may be filed to 23 April 2009. The draft of the proposed Notice of Appeal as filed on that date is to be treated as the Notice of Appeal ."

The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application on 16 January 2006.

Case7943,cited,Spitzel v Chinese Corporation (1899) 80 LT 347,"There was some debate between the Commissioner and the taxpayer as to the significance of share allotment and issue. In the circumstances, it does not seem to me necessary to explore this issue in any detail. Speaking generally, there will be an allotment when there is a binding contract to issue and take shares and an appropriation of shares, usually by the directors, to the intending member: Commonwealth Homes and Investment Company Limited v Smith [1937] HCA 73 ; (1937) 59 CLR 443 at 461, Dixon J; Central Piggery Co Ltd v McNicoll and Hurst [1949] HCA 19 ; (1949) 78 CLR 594 at 599 per Dixon J, quoting Spitzel v Chinese Corporation (1899) 80 LT 347 at 351 per Stirling J; and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Helens Farm (ACT) Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 4 ; (1981) 146 CLR 336 at 371 per Mason J. Plainly enough, an allottee acquires rights against the company, depending in part on the nature of the contract between the intending member and the company. These rights do not, however, turn the allottee into a member holding the shares. This will happen only when the shares ""issue"", that is, when the shareholder is ""put in control of the shares allotted"": see Central Piggery 78 CLR at 599-600 per Dixon J."

The Court will look at what the parties are intending to effectuate and how that was effectuated in part or in whole by the transactions in question: see also Mann v Sangria Pty Ltd (2001) 38 ACSR 307."
Case616,cited,Carey-Hazell v Getz Brothers &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1334,"The Federal Court of Australia Act and Order 52, rule 20 of the Federal Court Rules provides for what has been described as an 'undeniably broad discretionary judgment' ( Carey-Hazell v Getz Brothers &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1334 per French J [32]), which is consistent with other expressions of view: note, Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 642 per Tamberlin J [11]. In the decision in Carey-Hazell v Getz , French J noted a number of considerations to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion and those discretionary considerations derive, in large part, from the observations of Hill J in Equity Access v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) ATPR 40-972 at 50,635, and the observations of Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Melt Glow Pty Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 189."
Case20488,referred to,Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O'Malley 40 DLR (3d) 371,"The principles upon which the applicants rely are not in dispute. They are established in two authorities of the High Court and by a Canadian authority. The High Court authorities are Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd (in liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165 at [78] and Consul Developments Pty Ltd v DPC Estates Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 8 ; (1975) 132 CLR 373 at 393. The Canadian authority is the decision in Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O'Malley 40 DLR (3d) 371 ( 'Canaero' ). The statements of principle in the Canaero decision were set out in the judgment of Laskin J at 382, as follows: In my opinion, this ethic disqualifies a director or senior officer from usurping for himself or diverting to another person or company with whom or with which he is associated a maturing business opportunity which his company is actively pursuing; he is also precluded from so acting even after his resignation where the resignation may fairly be said to have been prompted or influenced by a wish to acquire for himself the opportunity sought by the company, or where it was his position with the company rather than a fresh initiative that lead him to the opportunity which he later acquired."
Case12349,considered,Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 88 ALD 90,"Mr Gormly places considerable reliance on Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 88 ALD 90 at [22] [24] where the Full Court observed that a s 20 notice in relevantly indistinguishable terms was, for this reason, misleading. 47 Mr Gormly acknowledges that the Act provides, by s 357A, for its procedures to be an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule before the Tribunal. He contends that as the Notice was not a notice served under the Act but under the Students Act and, as that notice did not apply to the substantive right considered by the Tribunal and its validity was not part of the hearing before the Tribunal, that section does not apply. 50 Mr Johnson makes six points in his submissions as to the alleged denial of procedural fairness: 1. The Court is reviewing the decision of the Tribunal, which has no role to play in the processes of s 20 of the Students Act. 2. It is now settled by Zhou and Cheng that there is no legal interaction between the processes of s 20 of the Students Act and a cancellation under s 116 of the Act. 3. It is not contended that the Notice did not comply with s 20 of the Students Act. In any event, Morsed does not say that there is a breach of procedural fairness by the Tribunal where a notice issued pursuant to s 20 of the Students Act is misleading. 4. Even if it were misleading, the Notice did not affect the power of the Delegate to effect a visa cancellation under s 116 ( Humayun at [30]). Further, the Tribunal conducted a merits review and any defects in the decision of the Delegate were cured by that review ( Zubair ; Cheng at [67]). 5. The question whether there could be a cure for any deficiency in the Notice that gave rise to a denial of natural justice could not affect the operation of s 116 of the Act. Such a denial could not result in jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. 6. No denial of natural justice or breach of statutory requirements can be established on the part of the Tribunal. 51 I agree, with respect, with the observations of the Full Court in Morsed at [21] that the Notice does not inform the recipient that, where the breach was due to exceptional circumstances beyond her control, the only way that a holder of a student visa who has breached Condition 8202 can avoid having their visa cancelled is not to comply with the Notice. The Notice is misleading for the reasons given in Morsed at [22] [25]. 52 Mr Gormly adopts the characterisation of the defects in the s 20 notice in Morsed and relies upon the denial of procedural fairness resulting from that notice with its attendant effect on the opportunity for the applicant to rely on exceptional circumstances to avoid cancellation of her visa. He refers to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [34] and submits that, because of the consequences of compliance with the Notice, the contents of the Notice cannot be quarantined from the procedural fairness requirements of a cancellation under s 116(3) of the Act. The failure to accord procedural unfairness cannot, he says, be cured by merits review by the Tribunal because of the lack of discretion on the part of the Delegate and the Tribunal."
Case15306,cited,Energy Drilling Inc. v Petroz N.L. [1989] ATPR 40-954,"Energy Drilling Inc. v Petroz N.L. [1989] ATPR 40-954 ( Energy Drilling) , Gummow J said (at p 50,422): The purpose of ordering security for costs against an applicant ordinarily resident outside the jurisdiction is to ensure that a successful respondent will have a fund available within the jurisdiction of this Court against which it can enforce the judgment for costs, so that the respondent does not bear the risk as to the certainty of enforcement in the foreign country and as to the time and complexity of the action there which might be necessary to effect enforcement : Kent Heating Ltd. V. Cook-on-Gas Products Pty. Ltd. &amp; Anor (1984) 59 A.L.R. 277 at p. 279. On the other hand, the mere circumstance that an applicant is resident outside the jurisdiction does not necessarily invite an exercise of discretion in favour of ordering security, the question being how justice will best be served in the particular case: Barton v. Minister for Foreign Affairs [1984] FCA 89 ; (1984) 2 F.C.R. 463 ; CBS Records Australia Ltd. &amp; Ors v. Telmak Teleproducts (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. (1987) ATPR p40-783 at pp. 48,554-48,555, (1987) 72 A.L.R. 270 at pp. 284-285. [My emphasis] The applicants submit that I should find that they would be likely to satisfy any adverse costs order and that this consideration, made on the basis of evidence of what they submit are assets available within the jurisdiction and other factors, should lead me to refuse Lodestar's application. The applicants refer to: the very significant resources of both applicants, but particularly Rare Breed, outside the jurisdiction; the presence of significant intangible assets within the jurisdiction; evidence of a concrete long-term commitment to doing business in Australia on the part of the applicants; a record of the applicants satisfying costs orders against them in overseas litigation between the same parties whenever such orders have been made; and the availability of reciprocal enforcement mechanisms in the applicants' ""home"" jurisdictions in the United States of America. Lodestar, on the other hand, submits that the ""assets within the jurisdiction"" on which the applicants rely are so problematical that they do not displace a presumption that is made in favour of an award of security in the case of foreign resident applicants, and that I should not, in effect, ""trust"" the applicants merely on account of their capacity to pay and other considerations on which they rely and to which I will refer below. In effect, Lodestar submits that the Court should approach the matter from the viewpoint of a respondent seeking to enforce a costs order and inquire whether that respondent would be subject to an unacceptable disadvantage by reason of the foreign residence of the applicants. I do not think that the availability of registration in the USA overcomes the procedural disadvantage that Lodestar would suffer in enforcing its costs order. Enforcing a costs order in the United States would take time and money and involve complexity that would not attend enforcement in Australia. See Energy Drilling at p 50,422 per Gummow J noted at [21] above. (vi) Notice of contention By a notice of contention, Lodestar seeks: a finding that Austin Nichols lacked standing under s 92(1) of the TM Act as it stood at the time when the removal applications were lodged; a finding that there were circumstances that were an obstacle to the use of the trade mark in the relevant period; and an exercise of the residual discretion not to order removal in a manner different from the way in which that discretion was exercised. If Lodestar's first contention prevails, Lodestar will succeed even in relation to the issue on which it failed before the Delegate (see [10] above). The applicants argue that Lodestar's second and third contentions would similarly be expected to go to the whole of the goods covered, but I need not discuss this submission."
Case1209,distinguished,SZAQI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1653,"In VBAM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 504 which was decided before SAAP , Gray J held that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to give notice under s 424A where the Tribunal intended to rely on contradictory evidence of a witness called by the applicant. He held that their evidence was information that the applicant gave for the purposes of the application. That decision is inconsistent with the remarks of Lee J (agreed to by Tamberlin J; Dowsett J dissenting) in the later decision of the Full Court in Applicant M164/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 16. Branson J followed that later decision in SZECG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 733. In that case, Branson J held that the appellant had not given information to the Tribunal by advising the Tribunal that he wanted the Tribunal to take evidence from his father. A different conclusion in relation to the evidence of a witness was arrived at in SZAQI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1653. The applicant's evidence in that case was contradicted by a witness who the applicant asked to be called in a letter written to the Tribunal. Bennett J contrasted that situation where evidence was 'called by the Tribunal as part of its inquisitorial function (cf SAAP)'. She referred to Applicant M164/2002 and said at [24]: 'Accordingly, I do not take Lee J as finding that evidence of a witness called by the applicant needs to be provided in writing to an applicant by reason of s 424A(1) of the Act. That information is evidence given by the applicant to the Tribunal within s 424A(3)(b) of the Act.' 80 The authorities are not at one in relation to the Tribunal's obligations under s 424A of the Act. However, this is not a case where there was one hearing at which there was more than one applicant including a dependent applicant. These were separate hearings with separate applicants. In those circumstances, this case can be distinguished from MZWMQ and M47/2004 . Nor is this a case where the applicant asked for a witness' evidence to be received during the hearing. For that reason, the decisions in VBAM of 2002 , Applicant M164/2002, SZECG and SZAQI are also not directly relevant to the circumstances of this case."
Case18253,cited,Lota Warria (on behalf of the Poruma and Masig Peoples) v Queensland (2005) 223 ALR 62,"The exercise of the Court's discretion pursuant to s 87A imports the same principles as those applying to the making of a consent determination of native title under s 87. The discretion conferred by s 87A and by s 87 must be exercised judicially and within the broad boundaries ascertained by reference to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act ( Hughes at [8] citing Lota Warria (on behalf of the Poruma and Masig Peoples) v Queensland (2005) 223 ALR 62 at [7])."
Case17258,referred to,Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376,"Secondly, the learned Chief Justice indicated at 671 [36] that he did not propose to follow the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Bayview Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) v Zan Holdings Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of Western Australia, Ipp, Wallwork and Steytler JJ, 19 October 1998). The Full Court had there adopted a somewhat liberal approach to materiality. It seems to me that a fair reading of the reasons of the Chief Justice is that the proper approach to materiality is the narrow one. For completeness, it should be noted that in my opinion two justices of this Court have approached the matter on the more narrow view and have certainly thought themselves to be implementing the position in Switz: see HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd (2002) 44 ACSR 169 at 184 [53] per French J; Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376 at [43] - [45] per Besanko J. That would be sufficient for me to feel obliged to approach the matter on the same basis."
Case9642,cited,Sheikholeslami v Brungs [2006] FCA 933,"It also follows that the manner in which the litigation had been conducted by the appellant, including being taken by surprise at such a fundamental piece of evidence, was a factor which the Tribunal could reasonably take into account in finding that the appellant had treated the Tribunal with indifference (cf Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Ltd (1990) 27 FCR 388 at 396 per Wilcox and Gummow JJ and Sheikholeslami v Brungs [2006] FCA 933 per Tamberlin J at [15]-[17]). The Tribunal was, in my view, entitled to take this history into account in considering whether it was 'appropriate' to reinstate the application within the meaning of s 42A(9) AAT Act. In this respect I note comments of Professor D Pearce in his book, Administrative Appeals Tribunal , LexisNexis, Butterworths, 2003, p 122, cited by the Tribunal in its reasons for decision."

GROUNDS OF REVIEW Mr Toro Martinez argued that the decision of the tribunal involved a jurisdictional error and therefore was to be regarded as no decision at all ( Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) on the following bases: (1) The only correct or preferable decision at which it could have arrived was that the decision should be set aside because the visa had not been granted or taken to be granted for the purposes of s 501 having regard to the law later laid down in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. (2) The tribunal ignored relevant considerations by failing to have regard to: (a) the impact on Mr Toro Martinez's daughter as revealed in her interview with the Department in June 2001, and her letter to the Department in July 2007 because it referred only to a letter she had written on 15 April 2008 in concluding that she would suffer some emotional hardship from his removal; and (b) the conclusion of the Department's International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment that, because of the poor overall security situation in Columbia, it would be unreasonable to expect Mr Toro Martinez's fianc&eacute;e or his daughter to leave the relative safety of Australian society and accompany him to Columbia. (3) The tribunal reached a conclusion not open on the evidence before it, namely that Mr Toro Martinez would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia because, first, the International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment had identified that other States were choosing not to return persons involuntarily to Columbia and, secondly, there were multiple human rights violations there. (4) Direction No 21 made by the Minister under s 499 of the Act was invalid because it went beyond the giving of directions or interfered with the unfettered discretion of a decision-maker under s 501(2). (5) The tribunal applied Direction No 21 by obeying its requirements to give prominence or weight to matters as primary considerations and thus failed to have regard to all of the relevant circumstances, according them appropriate weight as it saw fit. (6) The tribunal failed to accord procedural fairness because it did not give Mr Toro Martinez any opportunity, let alone a reasonable opportunity, to inspect documents to which it proposed to have regard in reaching its decision in contravention of s 39(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) or alternatively its common law obligation to accord him procedural fairness. Ground 1 Mr Toro Martinez argued that item 7 expressly referred to two classes of decision, first, those by the Minster made under identified sections of the Act (item 7(1)(a)) and secondly, by a delegate of the Minister made under only s 501 (item 7(1)(b)). He pointed out that in the 2008 amendment there was no reference to decisions made by the tribunal. He argued that if the Minister wished now to cancel a visa that previously had not been cancelled validly, he could do so under the new s 501HA. But, the Minister wished to have the legislation construed so as to make valid a decision of the tribunal which, at the time it was given, was not a decision at all because of its jurisdictional error in affirming a decision that could not have been made under s 501 ( Plaintiff S157 211 CLR at 506 [76]). Mr Toro Martinez argued that for this result to ensue clear words of necessary intendment were required, and the Parliament had not used them. He argued that all item 7(1) did was to restore validity to the delegate's decision. But, he contended, this did not affect the legal status of the tribunal's invalid decision. He argued that regardless of whether the decision of the delegate was valid or invalid, in reviewing that decision the tribunal was exercising an independent function under s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ."

Case2711,referred to,Wong v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 722,"Even if leave were sought, I would not be disposed to grant it. The present is a hopeless case. This is the second occasion in which the appellant has instituted proceedings for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in March 2004. There is no suggestion that the appellant seeks to challenge the decision on any new ground. Res judicata can operate as a bar to a judicial review application in these circumstances: see, for example, MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466 at [11] referring to Wong v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 722 at [71]; and MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 507 at [15] . Even if the circumstances did not give rise to res judicata, these second judicial review proceedings would attract an Anshun estoppel: see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589. Such an estoppel bars a party from raising any point which properly belonged to the subject of earlier litigation that the party, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time of the earlier proceeding. Furthermore, there is nothing to support the appellant's contention that the course taken by the Federal Magistrate on this occasion was so unfair or otherwise affected by error that it ought be set aside on appeal."
Case20252,considered,SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034,"There is no evidence that the Tribunal provided any notification to the appellant, in advance of the hearing date, that the statutory declaration would be relied upon. Further, the Tribunal was not invited by the appellant by a written communication before or at the hearing to consider the information in his declaration which would have activated the exemption: see M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 , SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034 and SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 , nor did the appellant bring the statutory declaration to the hearing. These facts suggest that the statutory declaration was not regarded by the appellant as being significant in his application before the Tribunal."
Case7482,applied,Sarina v Council of the Shire of Wollondilly (1980) 48 FLR 372,"Federal Court is a superior court (FCA Act, s 5(2)) and therefore, whatever the nature of the defect or defects in the proceedings, the sequestration order is not void or a nullity in the sense that it is without legal effect: see Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5 ; (1944) 68 CLR 571 at 590 per Rich J; Emanuele v ASC [1997] HCA 20 ; (1997) 188 CLR 114 at 119, 120 per Brennan CJ and at 156 per Kirby J; Re Anasis; Ex parte Total Australia Ltd (1985) 63 ALR 493 at 496 and Re Fuller [1999] FCA 1811 at [13] [16] per Hill J. This principle applies to orders made by registrars of the Federal Court pursuant to the scheme of delegation of powers under s 35A of the FCA Act: Official Trustee v Nedlands [2000] FCA 599 ; (2000) 173 ALR 255 at [22] [25] per Finn J. 88 In Cameron v Cole the High Court held that the Federal Court of Bankruptcy was a superior court and Williams J, whose dissent was not on this point, said (at 607): 'When, therefore, the Federal Court of Bankruptcy has made a sequestration order under the Act, it is not, in my opinion, a nullity, so that, even if it has been irregularly obtained, it operates until it is set aside and causes the debtor to become a bankrupt and his property to vest in the official receiver...' The sequestration order in the present case is therefore, at worst, voidable and was effective to bankrupt Ms Cross when it was made. The question of whether it can truly be seen to be voidable depends upon the applicability and operation of s 306. Section 306 only applies to a formal defect or an irregularity but where that precondition is satisfied, it operates automatically: Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; 165 CLR 71 at 81. As the High Court said in Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 225 ALR 396 at [24] , the composite expression 'a formal defect or an irregularity' conveys a meaning with elements of both inclusion and exclusion. The Court went on to say (at [26]): 'The question of construction raised by the words ""a formal defect or an irregularity"" is one to be decided by reading s 306 in the context of the whole Act, informed by the general purpose of the legislation, and the particular purpose of the provisions relating to bankruptcy notices. It is similar to the question that, in former times, would be explained by asking whether a statutory requirement was mandatory or directory. In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority it was said: ""A better test ... is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of [a] provision should be invalid ... In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to 'the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute'"".' The High Court also held that the kind or degree of breach is relevant to a consideration of s 306 and that if a defect could cause substantial injustice, it may not easily be classified as a formal defect or irregularity: see [18], [22]. Ultimately, the characterisation of a defect as formal or substantive is a matter for judgment, however, it is first necessary to consider, as the High Court has indicated, the legislative regime in relation to, in this case, creditors' petitions. A useful starting point is the analysis of Burchett J in Re Millar; Ex parte Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia (No 388/1993, unreported, 27 April 1993), where his Honour first set out what the Full Court had said in Ginnane v Diners Club Limited (1993) 120 ALR 375 at 376: 'Paragraph 52(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that at the hearing of a creditor's petition, the Court shall require proof of the service of the petition and, if it is satisfied with the proof of that service, as well as the other matters specified in sub-section 52(1), it may make a sequestration order against the estate of the debtor. Sub-section 52(2) provides, among other things, that if the Court is not satisfied with the proof of the service of the petition, it may dismiss the petition. These provisions illustrate a unique prescription relating to a petition for a sequestration order. A sequestration order affects the status of a person. The Legislature, in recognition of this feature, has insisted that the petitioner must prove, among other things, service of the petition on the debtor.' Burchett J went on to say: 'If one turns to s 52 of the Act, the force of what their Honours say is immediately apparent. It is a peculiar feature of litigation under the Bankruptcy Act , upon a creditors petition, that the court is expressly required to hear proof of service of the petition, and is expressly required, if it is not satisfied with the proof (among other things) of that matter, to dismiss the petition. It seems to me very difficult to regard s. 306 as capable of avoiding the consequences of any serious default, in respect of the requirements regarding the service of the petition so specifically stated in s. 52 , on the basis that such a serious default would be a mere formal defect or an irregularity. The requirements of s. 52 are essential requirements for the proof of the petition. They are made essential, no doubt, because the law recognises that proceedings in bankruptcy have an extraordinarily far reaching effect, not only upon the status of the debtor but also so as to convert, in some cases, actions and omissions of his in the past which at the time they were done or omitted did not constitute any offence into serious criminal offences.' It is clear from what his Honour said that having regard to the purposes of the statutory regime a serious breach of the requirements of service was intended by the legislature to lead to invalidity, in the sense that it would not constitute a mere formal defect to which s 306 would apply. This analysis echoes what the High Court said in Adams v Lambert , namely that the kind or degree of the breach is relevant to a consideration of s 306. In Re Ditfort; Ex Parte DCT (1988) 19 FCR 347, which was an application for annulment, Gummow J expressed agreement with the proposition, advanced by Walters J in Re Long; Ex parte Fraser Confirming Pty Ltd (1975) 12 SASR 130, that there is a necessity for strictness of proof in observance of the requirements for service of bankruptcy notices and bankruptcy petitions. His Honour said (at 359 360): 'Whilst not necessarily being of the view that s 306 can never apply in such a case in any circumstances, I respectfully agree with what was said by his Honour as to the importance of proper proof in these cases, and as to the salutary consequences for creditors of failure to comply with the rules...' In this case the relevant rules are, of course, the provisions of O 43 r 13 which set in place a special regime for service. The provisions of sub-rule 13(6) reflect the position in England as it became after Judicature: See, T Snow et a., The Annual Practice , 11 th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 1893 at 248; T W Chitty, Chitty's Archbold's Practice of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice 14 h edn, H Sweet &amp; Son, London, 1885 at 1144. The practice in Chancery before Judicature was that 'service of a copy of the bill was effected in the ordinary manner' ( Annual Practice, supra, at 248). The Rules of Court in the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) 38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 77 provided, relevantly in O 9 r 5: 'When a lunatic or person of unsound mind not so found by inquisition is a defendant to the action, service on the committee of the lunatic, or on the person with whom the person of unsound mind resides or under whose care he or she is , shall unless the Court or Judge otherwise orders, be deemed good service on such defendant.' (Emphasis added) In The Fore Street Warehouse Company Limited v Durrant &amp; Co. (1883) 10 Q.B.D. 471 the writ had been served on the lunatic defendant's business manager. Grove J said of the rule (at 473): 'I think the principle of this rule is that the service should be on some person qualified to act for the lunatic or most likely to know to whom the fact of service ought to be communicated. The manager of the lunatic's business might be ignorant of these matters. Where the writ is served in such a manner that it may probably never reach the lunatic, I do not think it can be valid and proper service. The plaintiffs may reasonably be required to go through the formalities which may give the friends of the lunatic a proper opportunity of appearing.' It is also useful to consider what has been said about the next step in the process contemplated by the rules, namely the appointment of a next friend or tutor. The Rules of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and in particular those which preceded the recent uniform civil procedure regime, are in a similar form to those which operate in this Court. In State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Hammond (1988) 15 NSWLR 395 Kirby P, with whom Hope and Mahoney JJA agreed, explained (at 400) that: '... the provisions of Pt 63, r 2 [which establishes the procedural requirement of a next friend] are simply machinery or procedure provisions. They are designed, principally, to ensure that there is someone answerable to the court on behalf of the litigant, with a disability; that crucial decisions affecting that litigant can be properly and responsibly made; and that a person exists who can bear any costs as are ordered against the person with the disability at the end of the litigation.' Two features of the language of O 43 r 13 merit particular consideration. First, while the machinery provisions of O 43 r 13, namely, sub-rules (3) (6) use the word 'may', one must take into account sub-rule (2) which provides: '(2) Personal service on a person under a disability shall not be effected otherwise than in accordance with this rule.' Second, a certain tension seems to arise within the rule when ones comes to sub-rule (4), which provides: '(4) The document may be served on any person (including the person under disability) whom the Court may, before or after service , approve.' However, when one bears in mind the purpose of this rule and its place in the broader rules as to litigation involving disabled persons, there is no tension between sub-rules (2) and (4). One can readily imagine a case where the Court would approve a particular person upon whom service could be effected. Indeed, it would be a prudent course to obtain such approval in advance of proceeding against a disabled person. On the other hand, where service has taken place in breach of the rule but those who care for the disabled person nevertheless appear at Court and no injustice has been occasioned by the breach of the rules, one appreciates how the Court might approve service which has already taken place. The discretion in sub-rule (4) is premised upon the mandatory nature of the rule, as reflected in the language of sub-rule (2). Where the objects of the rule have otherwise been achieved, it facilitates the proceedings moving forward by validating service which would have otherwise been prohibited. It is also important to note that the rules expressly reject the idea that one might serve, perhaps out of an abundance of caution, both the person designated by sub-rule 13(6) and the mentally disabled person with an initiating process such as a creditor's petition. The course which is not only to be preferred but which appears to be required is to approach the Court for a grant of approval. Only in relation to the limited class of documents in sub-rule (8) is a different approach to be adopted. Thus, in their general application the special rules as to service firmly ensure that their aim is attained, namely that an opportunity is afforded to those who care for a mentally disabled person to appear before the Court and to represent and protect that person's interests where by definition he or she does not have the capacity to do so alone. The existence of a facility for the proceedings to move forward once that aim has been achieved does not detract from the control which the Court maintains over this step in proceedings against mentally disabled persons. In bankruptcy proceedings the legislature has protected all debtors by requiring proof of service of the petition in every instance. In the case of mentally disabled persons that protection extends to the requirement to serve in accordance with the special rules designed to ensure that the opportunity is a real one. In my judgment, strict compliance with the provisions of O 43 r 13 is necessary in bankruptcy proceedings. A breach of these rules could result in substantial injustice being visited upon the disabled respondent. Moreover, a serious breach could defeat the intention of the O 43 altogether and lead to a breach of the fundamental rules of natural justice. The FCR require service upon a particular person and that was not done. The FCR also prohibit service upon the disabled person and that was ignored. The conduct of the Creditor constituted a serious breach of the FCR and resulted in a defect in the proceedings which was not a formal one. Section 306 does not apply and the sequestration order is voidable. The separate question of whether substantial injustice has been occasioned by the defect in these proceedings does not arise. In any event, I am of the opinion that in all the circumstances of this case substantial injustice has been occasioned by the defect which cannot be remedied by order of the Court save to set aside the sequestration order and dismiss the petition. The Annulment Issue It is quite clear that Ms Cross should not have been bankrupted. She was solvent at the time. A creditor who issues a creditor's petition runs the risk that if the debtor is solvent, the likelihood is that the petition will be dismissed with costs. The evidence suggests that Ms Cross, due to her state of mind, may have thought that the body corporate of her home unit building did not exist and that she therefore did not owe it any money. Whether that be right or not, bankruptcy proceedings are not for debtors who won't pay debts. They are for debtors who can't pay debts. As the Full Court said in Sarina v Council of the Shire of Wollondilly (1980) 48 FLR 372 at 376: 'In bankruptcy, rights of creditors to sue the bankrupt are converted into rights of proof against his estate and he is protected from suit. The avoidance of preferences, voluntary settlements and fraudulent dispositions of property by the bankrupt is intended to restore the property or money of the bankrupt to his estate to achieve a fair and rateable division of the bankrupt's property among his creditors. The bankrupt is disqualified from holding certain offices. Bankruptcy involves a change of status and quasi-penal consequences. Upon discharge from bankruptcy, the bankrupt is released form his debts subject to certain exceptions. These considerations negate the existence of any policy underlying the Act that a debtor should be made bankrupt if he is able to pay his debts but is unwilling to do so. If a debtor is able to pay his debts but is recalcitrant, his creditors may resort to the remedies otherwise afforded by the law such as execution against his property and garnishee proceedings. The words ""able to pay his debts"" in s. 52(2) of the Act do not mean ""willing and able"" to do so .' (Emphasis added) The parties are agreed that the bankruptcy should be brought to an end, the only question being how that should be achieved. By her motion, Ms Cross seeks to have the sequestration order made by the registrar on 9 August 2004 set aside. In opposing the motion, the Creditor and the Trustee contend that the appropriate course is to make an order pursuant to s 153B(1) of the Act annulling the bankruptcy. In a normal case, annulment is undoubtedly the appropriate course; but this is anything but a normal case. The matter which evokes the response on the part of the Trustee to oppose the motion is that in the case of annulment, the Trustee gets the benefit of s 154(1)(b) of the Act, namely, he may apply the property of Ms Cross still vested in him the home unit at 12/28 Tullimbar Road, Cronulla in payment of the costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy, including the remuneration and expenses of the Trustee; whereas, if the sequestration order is set aside, he has no such right of application. The Creditor's opposition to the setting aside of the sequestration order is no doubt sourced in the consequential orders I would make of dismissing the petition and revoking the costs order made by the registrar on 9 August 2004. At the outset, it may be said that there is no longer any third course, for example, rescission of the sequestration order: See s 37(2) of the Act; Vaucluse Hospital Pty Ltd v Phillips &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 44 at [19] and [20]. On the other hand, reviews of registrar's orders, like appeals to the Full Court, are outside the intended ambit of s 37. At the forefront of Ms Cross' case is that she was bankrupted on the first return date of a creditor's petition which was left with her while she was an involuntary patient in the Psychiatric Unit of Sutherland Hospital, but which I have found was not properly served, for a debt in respect of unpaid body corporate levies of $1,813.58, increased to approximately $2,400 by debt collection, legal and court costs of obtaining a default judgment in respect thereof; when, on the evidence before me, she owned assets in excess of half a million dollars including the home unit worth $375,000, money on deposit with major banks of more than $130,000 and shares and securities in major listed companies worth approximately $90,000. Moreover, Ms Cross was not present when the sequestration order was made. Had she, or representatives on her behalf, been present on the day, or if her circumstances and the circumstances of service of the Creditor's petition had been ventilated with the registrar on 9 August 2004 rather than being left buried in some affidavit of service, I have no doubt that the sequestration order would not have been made. Mr Bentley, in his submissions, said: 'At this point I would just like to also make this quite clear that my friend made some submissions about what happened in front of Registrar Tesoriero but that affidavit of Mr Wellmeela clearly says that she was served in a psychiatric unit. There is no hiding that, the documentation which was presented to the court clearly stated the fact. Now I presented that petition but unfortunately so long ago I can't remember what was said. I have a vague recollection that something may have been said about it but I can't recall and I am unable to assist the court or swear an affidavit so I haven't but there is no doubt that it is quite clear in evidence from Mr Wellmeela's affidavit what happened, where it happened and what was going on, so it is not as if anyone has tried to conceal this from the court or from the Registrar.' The fact is that Mr Bentley was the only person present before Registrar Tesoriero on 9 August 2004. He would not have been surprised at that. He certainly did not expect Ms Cross to be present. That he cannot remember what was said before the registrar on that day suggests to me that none of the relevant surrounding circumstances were brought to the registrar's attention because he, Mr Bentley, was blinded by an obsession to ensure that whatever else happened, Registrar Tesoriero made the sequestration order on that day. As an officer of the Court, he had an overriding duty to do more to draw to the Court's attention Ms Cross' circumstances and the circumstances under which she was purportedly served with the Creditor's petition. It is true that there has been some effluxion of time between the making of the sequestration order on 9 August 2004 and the filing of the motion on 7 November 2005. At least three things can be said about this, maybe more. First, there is no time limitation in which to bring a motion to set aside an order after it has been entered where the order has been made in the absence of a party: O35 r 7(2)(a) of the FCR, cf., s 35A(5) of the FCA Act and O 77 r 8 (now repealed) of the FCR. Second, there is a dearth of evidence as to what occurred in the period from 9 August 2004 until April 2005. It seems that the Trustee applied to become and became the registered proprietor of the home unit at Cronulla on or about 19 October 2004 but otherwise there was no administration of the bankrupt estate. The Legal Aid Commission became aware of Ms Cross' bankruptcy on or about 30 September 2004, nearly two months after she was made bankrupt. But otherwise there is no evidence as to what happened, if anything happened at all, in addition to the matters mentioned, during this period. In all the circumstances, I do not think this period should be counted as part of the effluxion of time. Third, on the evidence before me, the second period in the effluxion of time (from 11 April 2005 until 7 November 2005) was taken up by the OPC discovering the relevant evidence as to what took place, obtaining legal advice thereon and, on the basis of that advice, deciding what action was to be taken. In all the circumstances I do not find the second period so long as to militate against exercising my discretion to set aside the sequestration order rather than annul the bankruptcy. In re Daskalavski (Applicant); Ex parte The Austral Brick co Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 782 , Emmett J (in a short ex tempore judgment) concluded that, in circumstances where his Honour was satisfied that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, it was appropriate to annul the bankruptcy rather than set it aside where the estate had already been administered in bankruptcy. But that is not the case here. Only one asset of Ms Cross, her home unit at Cronulla, has been vested in the Trustee and the debt on which she was bankrupted, together with subsequent unpaid strata levies, was paid out by the OPC, not the Trustee, following the Protective Commissioner being appointed the financial manager of Ms Cross' financial affairs by order of the Guardianship Tribunal dated 11 April 2003. Notwithstanding the Trustee's claim for remuneration to 3 June 2005 ($13,990) and his anticipated claim for additional remuneration ($5,500), there was no evidence that the Trustee had been actively involved in the administration of Ms Cross' bankrupt estate. CONCLUSION When this choice as between an order that the sequestration order be set aside on the one hand and an order for annulment of the bankruptcy on the other has come before the courts on earlier occasions, the courts have consistently stressed that a balance must be struck between the rights of the applicant, who should never have been made bankrupt in the first place, and the Trustee who has simply done what the Act requires him to do: Kyriackou v Shield Mercantile Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2004] FCA 1338 at [43] per Weinberg J; followed in Capsalis v Ozdemir [2005] FMCA 1163 at [17] per Connolly FM; Hadjimouratis v Casanova [2005] FMCA 1468 at [13] and [16] per Connolly FM; and in Vaucluse Hospital Pty Ltd v Phillips at [70] and [71] per Riethmuller FM. The rights of the petitioning creditor have never been referred to as a relevant factor, and understandably so. This is not a case where the pendulum of balance tilts in favour of Ms Cross (compare Kyriackou ) as against the Trustee; on the contrary, I have come to the firm conclusion that it would be totally unfair, indeed a miscarriage of justice, for Ms Cross to be saddled with any of the relatively considerable costs of the administration of her estate. While that may involve the invocation of some injustice on the Trustee, in the circumstances of this case it seems it must be tolerated in the face of an inability of the Court to order the petitioning creditor to bear such costs: Kyriackou at [39] per Weinberg J. For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that as being the correct position, however, I do not think it is free from doubt. The powers of the Court under s 30 of the Act are expressed in extremely wide terms. In the circumstances of this case, it seems unjust to me that the Creditor only has to pay the costs of the motion even though it also loses the registrar's order as to costs of the petition. Because of the conclusion I have come to as expressed in [116] supra, I propose to exercise my discretion under O 35 r 7 of the FCR to set the sequestration order aside. In the circumstances, it is only appropriate that I summarise the matters I have taken into account in exercising my discretion to do so: 1. The inappropriateness of bankruptcy proceedings as a debt collection remedy or mechanism. Such proceedings were never intended to operate against debtors who could, but would not, for whatever reason, pay. 2. The size of the debt originally less than $2,000. 3. The aggregate value (free of encumbrances) of Ms Cross' assets closer to $600,000 than $500,000, approximately $200,000 of which were in liquid form. 4. The size of the actual and anticipated costs and expense of administering the estate: In excess of $35,000, when, on the evidence, there was minimal administration. 5. The circumstances of Ms Cross' mental condition and her admissions (once involuntarily) to the Psychiatric Unit of Sutherland Hospital during 2004 for a total of over three months. 6. My finding that Ms Cross was not properly served with the Creditor's petition. 7. The fact that she was not present or represented at the hearing at which the sequestration order was made. 8. The fact that the circumstances referred to in 5 and those underlying my finding in 6 were not ventilated before the registrar on 9 August 2004 (the first return date of the petition) when the sequestration order was made. 9. The fact that those involved in ensuring that Ms Cross was bankrupted on 9 August 2004 Messrs Meuller and Bentley were officers of the Court. The orders of the Court will be: 1. Michael Gregory Jones, trustee of the bankrupt estate of Isabell Jean Cross, be joined as a party (second respondent) to the proceeding, effective 6 December 2005. 2. The orders of Registrar Tesoriero made 9 August 2004 be set aside and the Creditor's petition dated 4 March 2004 and filed 23 March 2004 be dismissed. 3. The costs of Ms Cross and of the Trustee of the motion be paid by the Creditor on an indemnity basis.

Case21449,cited,National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155,"provisions were considered by a Full Court in National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155. The Court said (at 161-162) that: ""The Federal Court is a Court of wide jurisdiction throughout Australia whose judges may sit, whether as Full Courts or single judges, at any place in Australia. The Court has registries in each of the capital cities of the States and the Territories. The purpose of the provision in the rules of a ""proper place"" is to ensure the orderly and efficient conduct of the Court's business by requiring all documents filed in a proceeding to be in the custody and charge of the registry where the matter is then proceeding. The power conferred on the Court or a judge by s 48 is in terms wholly unfettered. It should be exercised flexibly having regard to the circumstances of the particular case. It would be regrettable and unwise if the Court were to circumscribe the general power conferred by s 48 with inflexible rules or impose inelastic constraints upon its exercise. As the power may be exercised subject to conditions, the Court or judge is in a position to mould orders under the section to take account of the many and varied circumstances that arise in particular cases. The power conferred by s 48 recognises the national character of this Court. The factors which the Court is entitled to take into account in considering whether one city is more appropriate than another for interlocutory hearings or for the trial itself are numerous. The Court must weigh those factors in each case. Residence of parties and of witnesses, expense to parties, the place where the cause of action arose and the convenience of the Court itself are some of the factors that may be relevant in particular circumstances. The balance of convenience will generally be a relevant consideration, but not necessarily determinative of each case. A party commences a proceeding by filing an application in a particular registry of the Court. If that party or another party wishes to have the proceeding conducted or continued in another place he may apply to the Court for an order under s 48 or O 10 r 1(2)(f) or O 30, r 6 as the case may be. There is no onus of proof in the strict sense to be discharged by the party seeking to conduct or continue the proceedings elsewhere. It should be noted that the Court may exercise its powers under O 30, r 6 either on the application of a party or on its own motion. The Court must, however, be satisfied, after considering all relevant matters, that there is sound reason to direct that the proceeding be conducted or continued elsewhere. Its starting point is that the proceeding has been commenced at a particular place. Why should it be changed? On the one hand, if the party who commenced the proceeding chose that place capriciously the Court would be justified in giving no weight to the choice of place. At the other end of the scale, a proceeding may have continued for some time at the place of commencement with many steps having been taken there, for example, filing of pleadings and affidavits, discovery and inspection. Due weight would be given by the Court to such matters before directing that the proceeding should continue at a different place. The balance of convenience is important, but its weight must vary from case to case. Ultimately the test is: where can the case be conducted or continued most suitably bearing in mind the interests of all the parties, the ends of justice in the determination of the issues between them, and the most efficient administration of the Court. It cannot and should not, in our opinion, be defined more closely or precisely"" (emphasis added). As National Mutual makes clear, the Court has an unfettered discretion which is to be exercised in the interests of justice in the circumstances of the case in which the application is made. The applicant contends that the proceeding should be transferred to the New South Wales District Registry for a number of related reasons. Since the representative proceeding was instituted in Victoria, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (""the ACCC"") has commenced proceedings against some of the respondents in respect of the same or substantially similar conduct on which it appears that the present applicant also relies. All of the proceedings commenced by the ACCC have been filed in the New South Wales District Registry. Proceedings against Qantas and British Airways were heard and determined in Sydney by Lindgren J in December 2008. There are presently before Jacobson J proceedings which have been brought by the ACCC against Singapore Airlines (NSD 1980/2008), Cathay Pacific (NSD 363/2009), Emirates Airlines (NSD 876/2009) and Garuda Airlines (NSD 955/2009). Jacobson J has expressed the view that ""... it seems to me that it is convenient for [these cases] to be case managed together. They are going to raise very similar issues and it would be more effective if they run in tandem, at least for the time being"". Jacobson J has also been involved in a number of interlocutory hearings in some of these proceedings."
Case517,considered,Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82,"The "" counter-claim, set-off or cross demand "" referred to in s 40(1)(g) and 41(7) "" must be something sounding in money "": Re Brinks; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 30 ALR 433 , 44 FLR 135 at 138 per Lockhart J. See also: Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 at 85 per Henchman J. 28 Consistent with the legislative objective sought to be achieved by s 40(1)(g) , it has been held that the phrase "" could not have been set up "" refers to a "" cross-claim, set-off or cross demand "" which could not have been set up as a matter of law; a mere failure to take advantage of an opportunity to do so does not fall within s 40(1)(g): Re Vicini; Ex parte E A Sealey &amp; Co (1982) 64 FLR 323. Fisher J there usefully summarised as follows some of the relevant authorities (at 326): The relevant words of the Act were considered by Lockhart J in Re Brink; Ex parte The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd. (1980) 44 FLR 135, at p 139, when he said: ""The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 , at p 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 KB 726, at p 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 ABC 53 , at p 57, especially per Lukin J where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained ... . Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'"" In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p 730 Avory J said: ""I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action. ""I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action."" The judgment debtor was there asserting that, despite his best endeavours, he could not obtain "" factual and expert evidence "" to establish his counterclaim. That was not sufficient to bring himself within s 40(1)(g). Fisher J concluded (at 326): In my opinion these statements of principle... determine the matter against the debtor. There was no reason in law why he could not set up his counterclaim in the creditor's proceedings. ...

Case13358,cited,Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437,"This (together with the Minister's submissions) was the foundation for the Federal Magistrate saying in his reasons at [27]: Although the headings on the 25 January 2007 facsimile might have put an alert reader at the Tribunal on notice that not all pages which had been intended to be sent were actually sent, or at least had not been received, the Tribunal is not obliged to make inquiries or to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which the applicant choses [sic] not to embark upon: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21 22 [42] and [43]; Re Ruddock; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 451 [58]. No error is demonstrated by the Tribunal not correcting the applicant's adviser's error. 46 In [27] of his reasons, the Federal Magistrate cited two cases in support of his conclusion that there was no duty to inquire: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21-22 [42] - [43] and Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 451 [58]. The first ( SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; 207 ALR 12) was a reference to the reasons of Gummow and Hayne JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed). Their Honours in that case said that the power to obtain evidence under s 427 did not import an element of duty, a position made plain by s 426(3). That was a straightforward recognition that no duty to enquire about evidence arises from the terms of s 427 of the Migration Act . This much can be readily accepted. There are ample Full Court decisions to like effect. In S154 201 ALR 437, Gummow and Heydon JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) said in the context of examining how detailed the questioning of an applicant was required to be said that: The Tribunal conducting an inquisitorial hearing is not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which the applicant chooses not to embark on. This reference has nothing to do with the question here. 57 These conclusions can be fortified by the recognition, so often stated, that the Tribunal is engaged in an inquisitorial process: Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154 201 ALR at 450-451 [57]-[58], 455-6 [81], 457 [86] and [88]; Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; 206 CLR 57 at 69-70 [31] - [32] ; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at 435 [29] - [31] ; Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601 at 648 [208] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487 at 513 [97]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at 146 [52] ; Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576 [187] ; NCSC v News Corporation Limited [1984] HCA 29 ; (1984) 156 CLR 296 at 315; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2006) 204 CLR 82 at [75] ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2003) 195 ALR 1 at 8; Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at 405, [78] ; Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at [39] ; VEAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 24; Re Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2003) 217 CLR 387 at 413 [76] ; NAFF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [22] ; SZAYW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 49 ; (2006) 229 ALR 423 at [4] ; SZBEL 228 CLR 592 at [40]; SZFDE [2007] HCA 35 at [30] ; Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 at 540-41 [71] , 526 [18] and 531 [37]; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [111] ff and [199]; NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 223 ALR 171 at [9] , [69] and [165]."
Case14369,considered,Guglielmin v Trescowthick (No 3) (2005) 220 ALR 535,"I am informed that there has been an appeal from that decision, but until that appeal is heard and determined, the order of the County Court and the application to VCAT stand as matters of which I should take cognisance. In those circumstances I need to consider, without more, whether or not this action brought by the applicant should be stayed. The principles in relation to a stay were set out, appropriately, in a number of the cases, but conveniently, the principles are set out by Mansfield J in Guglielmin v Trescowthick (No 3) (2005) 220 ALR 535 at [8]-[21]. 15 One starts with the important proposition that it is a fundamental principle that an applicant is entitled to have his or her action tried in the ordinary course of the procedure and business of the Court subject only to the exercise of judicial discretion on proper grounds as part of the Court's inherent powers. In this particular case there is already a question of the proper legal representation of the first respondent and in addition also there are the applications of the first and second respondents to have the whole application dismissed. Necessarily, they are matters that need to be determined before the applicant can go to trial in relation to this matter. If a stay is granted obviously it will affect the process by which the first and second respondents seek to have summary judgment and those matters will be stayed as well, as the whole proceeding being stayed itself. 16 In the unusual circumstances of this case, it is my view that a stay should be granted pending the hearing and determination of the matter before VCAT and I propose to so order.

Case8567,considered,Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [1987] UKHL 12 ; [1989] AC 53,"I referred above to the absence of reference to the context in which the duty allegedly owed Scott Rush is said to arise for this reason. In Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 (""Tame"") at [231] Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in dicta: ""It is unlikely that an investigating police officer owes a duty of care to a person whose conduct is under investigation. Such a duty would appear to be inconsistent with the police officer's duty, ultimately based in the statutory framework and anterior common law by which the relevant police service is established and maintained, fully to investigate the conduct in question."" Their Honours cited in support of this view the decisions (inter alia) of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [1987] UKHL 12 ; [1989] AC 53 (""Hill"") at 63-65 and Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at [60] . Similar views were expressed in Tame by McHugh J at [125]-[126]; Hayne J at [298] and by Callinan J at [335]-[336]. 92 It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can, on occasion, be ""inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of [their public] responsibilities"": cf Sullivan v Moody , at [62]; (whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law) and to be impermissible for that reason. As the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Tame illustrate, this inconsistency is often revealed where, in a setting in which injury is foreseeable if care is not taken in the conduct of a police investigation, a suspect, a victim, or a third party injured by acts or omissions of the police seeks to raise a claim in negligence against the police: Hill , above; Thompson v Vincent [2005] NSWCA 219 at [152] - [154] ; Batchelor v State of Tasmania [2005] TASSC 11 ; Cran v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 92 ; (2004) 62 NSWLR 95; see also D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 214 ALR 92 at [101] ; State of New South Wales v Paige [2002] NSWCA 235 ; (2002) 60 NSWLR 371 at [115] - [117] . Save in exceptional circumstances: cf Hill at 62; Batchelor , above; and in North America see e.g. Doe v Board of Commissioners for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (1990) 72 DLR 4 th 580 (""Doe""); Eaton, ""Liability of Municipality or Other Governmental Unit for Failure to Provide Police Protection from Crime"" 90 ALR 5 th 273 at SS4 ; 57 Am Jur 2d, ""Municipal, County, School and State Tort Liability"", SSSS407-418; such attempts have been unsuccessful. 94 The progenitor of this principle was the decision of the House of Lords in Hill . After concluding that, in the circumstances of that case, the ordinary principles of negligence would not admit of a duty of care to a victim of crime, Lord Keith went on to indicate (at 63) that there was ""another reason"" why an action for damages in negligence should not be against the police in the circumstances of that case and that was ""public policy"". His Lordship then observed: ""The general sense of public duty which motivates police forces is unlikely to be appreciably reinforced by the imposition of such liability so far as concerns their function in the investigation and suppression of crime. From time to time they make mistakes in the exercise of that function, but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it. In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind. The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police cannot be excluded. Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done, with the result that he went on to commit further crimes. While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation, as indeed the present action would seek to do. The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion, for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources. Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question, yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so. A great deal of police time, trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial. The result would be a significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function, that of the suppression of crime. Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed, not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted. I therefore consider that Glidewell LJ, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal [1988] QB 60, 76 in the present case, was right to take the view that the police were immune from an action of this kind on grounds similar to those which in Rondel v Worsley [1967] UKHL 5 ; [1969] 1 AC 191 were held to render a barrister immune from actions for negligence in his conduct of proceedings in court."" 101 It is, in my view, unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether, as in England, a special though not unqualified, immunity rule applies to police activities ""in the investigation and suppression of crime"": Costello's case at 563; or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and, if relevant, common law functions: see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan . I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail. However, I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating ""reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire ... has been thought to lay down"" on the immunity of police: cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police , at [3], [6] and [28]; and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity: see e.g. Costello ; Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary [2001] EWCA Civ 1699 ; tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police, while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law: cf Doe , 72 DLR 4 th at 584-586. 104 As I earlier noted, the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at [60] above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation. Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame . In its apparent endorsement of Hill at [57] in the above quotation, Sullivan along with Hill and D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above, have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is ""an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public"": Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]. Again, as I have already noted, Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation."
Case8026,applied,DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v InterTAN Inc [2004] FCA 1251,"In my view I do have power to make the order sought by WCNI. The power is to be found in s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v InterTAN Inc [2004] FCA 1251 at [14] , Allsop J said that s 43 is a broad and ample power, which is not to be read down otherwise than by judicial principle conformable with its amplitude. His Honour's remarks were made in a different context, but I consider that they are applicable to the present application. 9 It seems to me that what is necessary for the exercise of the power is to find some connection between the Supreme Court proceeding and the proceeding in this Court, in order to justify the order for payment of the supporting creditor's costs, including the costs of commencing in the Supreme Court, out of the process of the winding-up. 10 The course which has been followed by WCNI, in coming to this Court as the supporting creditor, is the cheapest and most expedient course which could have been followed. In my view this step has rationalised the processes before this Court and has, indeed, rationalised both sets of proceedings, in a way which produces the most convenient and expeditious result in terms of costs incurred in the Court's processes. 12 In my view the order which is sought, therefore, falls within the broad power to which Allsop J referred in considering the amplitude of s 43 of the Federal Court Act . It follows that I propose to accede to the application made to me by Mr Davis of counsel for WCNI. 13 Mr Davis's instructing solicitor is in Court and he has informed me that when the Supreme Court proceedings are returnable on 6 March, an order will be sought that the proceedings be dismissed, with no order as to costs. Plainly, the Supreme Court could not now entertain the application to wind-up the company, because I will make a winding-up order this afternoon and in light of the course proposed today, the obvious approach in the Supreme Court is that there be no order as to costs sought in that matter. Mr Davis's instructing solicitor has undertaken to the Court to seek those orders in the Supreme Court on 6 March 2008. 14 Accordingly, the orders that I will make this afternoon are as set out in [1] to [3] of the originating process filed by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation on 24 January 2008. I will also order that the costs of WCNI, as supporting creditor, be paid out of the assets of the defendant, and in particular that those costs include the costs of WCNI of and incidental to proceedings No. 1199 of 2008 in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Equity Division.

In the course of his reasons for judgment Meagher JA adverted to s 553 of the Corporations Law at 183-5 [7] and [13]. In addressing whether any payment ordered to be made by the Commission might qualify as a contingent debt or claim within the meaning of s 553(1) of the Act his Honour said at [13]: '... The word ""contingent"" is a slippery word. ... In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Gosstray [1986] VR 876 at 878, Tadgell J said: ""An attempt to formulate a universally applicable definition of a contingent debt or of a contingent creditor is difficult ... .

The following statement by Pennycuick J in Re William Hockley Ltd ... is well known: 'The expression ""contingent creditor"" ... must, I think, denote a person towards whom under an existing obligation, the company may or will become subject to a present liability upon the happening of some future event or at some future date'. In Re Gasbourne Pty Ltd [1984] VR 801 at 837, Nicholson J said that he did not regard that description as exhaustive, and with respect I would not disagree. ... "" It follows ... that ... one cannot accurately categorise Miss Fisher's rights (if any) as a ""contingent"" debt or claim. She has the bare right to make a claim, nobody knowing whether it will succeed or not, or if so in what amount, or subject to what terms or conditions. ...' 78 In his reasons for judgment Sheller JA, with whom Beazley JA agreed, said at 193 [44]: '... at the relevant date Dataflow was under no existing obligation to pay a sum of money by way of a retrenchment payment to Ms Fisher immediately or on a future event. Ms Fisher had only a right to take proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission to vary the contract to that end. ... [46] However Ms Fisher's right under s 106 of the Industrial Relations Act be categorised, her right to invoke the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission did not until such time as an order was made create any obligation on Dataflow to make a retrenchment payment to her. Moreover, even if the Industrial Relations Commission declared the contract unfair, varied it ab initio and ordered Dataflow to make a retrenchment payment to Ms Fisher, it remains true that at the relevant date of Mr Madden's appointment no amount for retrenchment payment had become payable before, on or after the relevant date.' 79 The position in relation to a claim under the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) is on all fours with a claim for costs in respect of an application to wind up a company to which s 466 of the Act applies. 80 Following the process of reasoning indicated in Fisher , Gzell J held in Silbermann v One.Tel Limited (No 2) [2002] NSWSC 295 ; (2002) 20 ACLC 846 at 850-1 that an application to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission for the variation of a contract of service to include an indemnity against a director's liability in respect of corporate credit cards issued by American Express International Inc and Diners Club Pty Limited did not constitute future claims within the meaning of s 553 of the Act which were admissible to proof against the respondent, One.Tel Limited. 82 After referring to a passage from Sheller JA in Fisher , Gzell J continued at [16]: '... it seemed unlikely to his Honour that the legislative intention was no longer to confine an obligation to one in existence at the relevant date but to extend the category of future claim to any obligation which comes into existence at any time in the future. In my view, such a construction of s 553(1) would place an intolerable burden on a liquidator whose responsibility it is to determine which future claims are to be admitted to proof and in what amounts.'"
Case16615,discussed,"Williams v The Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Melbourne [1933] HCA 56 ; (1933) 49 CLR 142","Williams v The Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Melbourne [1933] HCA 56 ; (1933) 49 CLR 142 ("" Williams v Melbourne Corporation ""), a local government by-law dealing with the driving of cattle through public streets was challenged on the ground that it was unreasonable. Dixon J (as he then was) said (at 155) in a passage quoted many times since: ""To determine whether a by-law is an exercise of a power, it is not always enough to ascertain the subject matter of the power and consider whether the by-law appears on its face to relate to that subject. The true nature and purpose of the power must be determined, and it must often be necessary to examine the operation of the by-law in the local circumstances to which it is intended to apply. Notwithstanding that ex facie there seemed a sufficient connection between the subject of the power and that of the by-law, the true character of the by-law may then appear to be such that it could not reasonably have been adopted as a means of attaining the ends of the power. In such a case the by-law will be invalid, not because it is inexpedient or misguided, but because it is not a real exercise of the power. (Compare Widgee Shire Council v. Bonney .)"" (Citation omitted.) A little later in his reasons, Dixon J referred (at 156) to the question of whether a restraint embodied in the by-law could be reasonably adopted for the purpose set out in the empowering provision."
Case20348,referred to,"Regina v Derby Magistrates' Court, Ex parte B [1996] 1 AC 487","Having said that, it is also in the interests of the whole community that lawyers give their clients sound advice, accurate as to the law and sensible as to their conduct (see Three Rivers District Council at 659). In this regard, a man must be able to consult his lawyer in confidence, since otherwise he might hold back half the truth. The client must be sure that what he tells his lawyer in confidence will never be revealed without his consent. Legal professional privilege is more than an ordinary rule of evidence, limited in its application to the facts of a particular case. It is a fundamental condition on which the administration of justice as a whole rests (per Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ in his speech in Regina v Derby Magistrates' Court, Ex parte B [1996] 1 AC 487 at 507)."
Case233,distinguished,Re Debtor [1908] 1 KB 344,"The appellant relies on the following passage in PP McQuade and MGR Gronow, McDonald , Henry and Meek: Bankruptcy Law and Practice (5 th edn, 1996) at [40.1.335]: ""A creditor who, after he or she has served a bankruptcy notice, takes from the debtor a bill of exchange or promissory note for the debt, cannot, during the currency of the bill or the note, obtain a sequestration order founded on the notice, since, until the bill or note is dishonoured, it must be treated as payment (Ex parte Matthew; Re Matthew (1884) 12 QBD 506) and the position is the same, if, although dishonoured, it is in the hands of a third person to whom it has been endorsed for value by the creditor: Re Debtor [1908] 1 KB 344."" That passage does not assist the appellant. It assumes that the creditor has accepted the note. That the author uses the word ""take"" in that sense is made clear when one reads the two cases to which he refers. In each of those cases, the note had been accepted. For the same reason, each of those cases can be distinguished from the instant case."
Case8686,cited,Musgrove v McDonald [1905] HCA 50 ; (1905) 3 CLR 132 ,"It may be that the drafter of the notice of appeal overlooked that a judgment as defined by the Federal Court Act and the WR Act is an operative judicial act so that there is no appeal from reasons for judgment alone ( Hi-Fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc (No 3) (1998) 86 FCR 374). Nor does an appeal lie from a verdict alone prior to judgment being given ( Musgrove v McDonald [1905] HCA 50 ; (1905) 3 CLR 132 at 142). I conclude that the reference to ""the orders made on 15 October 2007"" is to be understood as, or including, a reference to the operative order of the District Court made on that day requiring Citigroup to pay Mr Mason the amount found to be owing to him in respect of annual leave entitlements and interest."

These are those reasons. 4 The Court is not, of course, bound to make orders giving effect to terms of settlement agreed on between the parties. The principles to be applied by the Court in determining whether to order the imposition of a pecuniary penalty for contravention of the Act, where parties propose a particular sum, are expounded in N W Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (1997) 71 FCR 285 at 290-5. They are refined and elaborated upon in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at [51] to [58]; (2004) ATPR 41-993 at [51] to [58]. I am also mindful of the observations of Emmett J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 819 at [46] to [56]; (2004) ATPR 42-011 at [46] to [56]. In particular, I note the following observations made by his Honour in that case: '[53] ... there is a public interest in prompting settlement of litigation, particularly litigation that is likely to be lengthy and complex. Thus, in giving weight to a joint submission on a proposal that would resolve a proceeding, the Court can have regard to the savings of resources both for a regulator, such as the Commission, and for the Court if the proposal were to be accepted. The savings in resources, for example, are capable of being used by the regulator to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the court. [ 54] The view of a regulator such as the Commission as a specialist body is relevant in determining the question of penalty, although it is by no means determinative. The Court will expect a regulator such as the Commission to explain to it the process of reasoning that has led to the resolution proposed. In particular, if a proposed penalty involves a discount from that which might otherwise be considered to be the appropriate penalty so as to reflect a degree of cooperation, the Court would expect the Commission to explain the basis upon which the discount had been calculated. ... [56] The Court will be mindful that, where an agreed penalty is proposed, there may be elements of compromise involved in both sides. Thus, it may be that evidentiary difficulties perceived by the Commission would warrant the abandonment of some claims. Certainty of outcome for both parties may be a very significant factor in the reasoning process that leads to agreement on penalty. For reasons such as those, if the Court is not disposed to impose a penalty proposed by the parties, it would be appropriate to give the parties the opportunity to withdraw consent for all of the proposed orders and to permit the proceeding to continue on a contested basis.""

Case8463,cited,Attorney-General v Wentworth (1988) 14 NSWLR 481,"operation of O 21 of the Federal Court Rules , as then in force, was considered by Sackville J in Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378. The following principles emerge from that decision at [51]-[59] and are relevant to the present form of O 21: (a) The power to make an order under O 21 is to be exercised having regard to the fundamental principle that every person has a right of access to the Court to seek remedies in consequence of an alleged infringement of his or her rights and that it is a serious thing to limit or restrict that right. (b) The power to restrict that right of access exists to protect the Court's own processes against unwarranted usurpation of judicial time and resources and to avoid the loss and disruption caused to those who face actions which lack substance. (c) The terms of O 21 r 1 identify the jurisdictional criteria which must be established before the power to make any order will arise. An application for such an order needs to show that the person against whom such an order is sought: - habitually and persistently; - and without any reasonable cause; - institutes; - a vexatious proceeding; - in the Court [or any other Australian court]. (d) The expression ""habitually and persistently"" implies more than ""frequently"". ""Habitually"" suggests that the institution of proceedings is undertaken automatically and without due consideration to the merits of the proceedings. ""Persistently"" suggests determination and continuation in the face of difficulty or opposition, with a degree of stubbornness. (e) The test of whether a vexatious proceeding has been commenced ""without any reasonable cause"" is an objective one. The relevant inquiry is whether the legal proceedings in fact can be shown to have had no reasonable basis regardless of the subjective motive or point of view of Mr Tsekouras. Similar principles were stated by Roden J in Attorney-General v Wentworth (1988) 14 NSWLR 481 which considered the equivalent provision of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) ('the Supreme Court Act ')."

This ground fails. 22 The appellant has not particularised the claim which he alleges was not considered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal made reasoned findings in respect to the Appellant's claims based on his religion and political opinion. The Federal Magistrate found at [43] that the Tribunal did not reach any conclusion as to the one child policy being a law of general application. Rather, the Tribunal found that there was no real chance that the appellant would suffer persecution in consequence of that policy if he returned to China."
Case13731,referred to,Re Raymond; Ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424,"Section 153B(1) of the Act relevantly provides that: ""If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made ...the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy."" Section 153B(1) and its predecessors have been considered in many decisions of this and other Courts. These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions. They are: (1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402. (2) An applicant who seeks an annulment of his or her bankruptcy ""carries a heavy burden"". It is incumbent on an applicant ""to place before the Court all relevant material with respect to his or her financial affairs so that the Court may be properly informed and may make a judgment that is based on the actual circumstances of the applicant"": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531. (3) In determining whether or not a sequestration order ""ought not to have been made"" the Court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made on the facts known to the Court at the time at which it was made. The Court must take account of facts, known at the time at which the sequestration order was made and at which it determines an annulment application, even if those facts were not before the Court at the time at which the sequestration order was made: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243; Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426. (4) A sequestration order ""ought not to have been made"" if, on the facts known at the time of the annulment application, the Court would have been bound not to make the sequestration order: Re Frank; ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396. (5) The Court will be so satisfied if it is established that the debtor was not, at the time the sequestration order was made, indebted to the petitioning creditor: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420 at 422. (6) If the Court is so satisfied, it is not precluded from annulling the bankruptcy because the bankrupt had not sought to have the default judgment set aside or failed to oppose the creditor's petition or failed to seek a review of the sequestration order: Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426. (7) The power conferred on the Court by s 153B(1) is discretionary in nature. Even if persuaded that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, the Court can, in appropriate circumstances, decline to annul the bankruptcy: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243. (8) Considerations which may have a bearing on the exercise of discretion include unexplained delay in the making of the application, whether or not the applicant is solvent, whether or not the applicant has made full disclosure of his or her financial affairs and a failure by the bankrupt to oppose the creditor's petition and attend the hearing at which the sequestration order was made: Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 24-5; Boles at 247; Re Papps; ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531; Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [79] ; Cottrell v Wilcox [2002] FCA 1115 at [7] .

Case20414,cited,Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 188 ALR 143,The Court's general discretion to award costs is conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). It is well accepted that the general discretion conferred by s 43 is absolute and unfettered but that it must be exercised judicially and not on grounds unconnected with the litigation: see Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 11; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 727 at 732. In the exercise of that discretion the usual principle applied is that ordinarily costs follow the event so that a successful litigant receives costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order: Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 188 ALR 143 at [11] .

Case23028,followed,"Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1991) 31 FCR 100","In Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 the Full Court considered the question whether an applicant for a licence to sell 'X-rated' videos had been denied natural justice on the ground that the decision maker had not, prior to refusing to grant the licence, given the applicant an opportunity to make submissions beyond the submissions the applicant had already made. In reversing the trial Judge's decision, the Full Court considered the scope of the concept of natural justice in relation to such a hearing and said at 590: It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material: Dixon v Commonwealth (1981) 61 ALR 173 at 179. However, as Lord Diplock said in F Hoffman-La Roche and Co. A.G. v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) AC 295 at 369: ""... the rules of natural justice do not require the decision maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision. If that were a rule of natural justice only the most talkative of judges would satisfy it and trial by jury would be abolished."" A person likely to be affected by an administrative decision to which requirements of procedural fairness apply can support his or her case by appropriate information but cannot complain if it is not accepted. On the other hand, if information on some factor personal to that person is obtained from some other source and is likely to have an effect upon the outcome, he or she should be given the opportunity of dealing with it: Kioa v West at 587 (Mason J), 628 (Brennan J). Within the bounds of rationality a decision-maker is generally not obliged to invite comment on the evaluation of the subject's case: Sinnathamby v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1986) 66 ALR 502 at 506 (Fox J), 513 (Neaves J). In Ansett Transport Industries Ltd v Minister for Aviation (1987) 72 ALR 469 at 499, Lockhart J expressly agreed with the observations of Fox J in Sinnathamby on this point. See also Geroudis v Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1990) 19 ALD 755 at 756-7 (French J) and Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government, and Ethnic Affairs (supra) at 103 (Keely J), 119 (Gummow J). The general propositions set out above may be subject to qualifications in particular cases. Two such qualifications were enunciated by Jenkinson J in Somaghi at 108-109: 1. The subject of a decision is entitled to have his or her mind directed to the critical issues or factors on which the decision is likely to turn in order to have an opportunity of dealing with it: Kioa v West at 587 (Mason J); Sinnathamby at 348 (Burchett J ); Broussard v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 98 ALR 180 at 189 (Burchett J). 2. The subject is entitled to respond to any adverse conclusion drawn by the decision-maker on material supplied by or known to the subject which is not an obvious and natural evaluation of that material: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kumar (unreported, Full Court, Federal Court, 31 May 1990); Kioa v West at 573, 588 and 634 . 23 In Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1991) 31 FCR 100, the majority of the Full Court said at 119: However, in a particular case, fairness may require the applicant to have the opportunity to deal with matters adverse to the applicant's interest which the decision-maker proposes to take into account, even if the source of concern by the decision-maker is not information or materials provided by the third party, but what is seen to be the conduct of the applicant in question."
Case7580,cited,Corporate Affairs Commission v Smithson (1984) 3 NSWLR 547,"The provisional character of the judgments upon which the orders for the appointment of the receivers were based informs consideration of the question whether the receivers' costs of discharging their functions under those orders should be borne by the defendants. It is not the object of the orders made under s 1323 to punish the defendants. Their object is to preserve their assets and thereby protect the interests of persons to whom they may have a liability. A secondary object is to ascertain the extent of the assets. This understanding of the purpose of such orders is well established in case law relating to s 1323 and its predecessors. In Corporate Affairs Commission v Smithson (1984) 3 NSWLR 547, Waddell J said of the like provisions of s 573 of the Companies (New South Wales) Code (at 553): '... the purpose of appointing a receiver is to provide security for the moneys which the relevant person is, or may become, liable to pay.' See also Corporate Affairs Commission v Transphere (1988) 15 NSWLR 596 at 611; Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1992) 10 ACSR 525 at 531. 21 The point was well made by Waddell J in Corporate Affairs Commission v Smithson in which the appointment of receivers under s 573 of the Corporations (New South Wales) Code was considered. The section was, in the relevant parts, similar to s 1323. Waddell J pointed to the 'severe effects' that the appointment of a receiver might have upon a defendant noting that the court was precluded from requiring the Commission to give an undertaking as to damages as a condition of appointing a receiver. Unjustified and irrecoverable damage could be suffered where the relevant person was subject to the appointment of receivers as security for claims which might not be made out. Waddell J further said (at 556): 'If a receiver is appointed on terms which permit him to take his remuneration out of the assets received by him, the unjustified damage caused to the relevant person would be so much greater. It should not be thought that in every case the property of a relevant person may be taken over by a receiver and his financial affairs investigated in order to provide security for claims against him, which may or may not succeed, on the basis that in any event the relevant person will have to pay the receiver's remuneration. It may well be that in a particular case, in order to avoid such a consequence, no order should be made permitting the receiver to take his remuneration out of the assets received, thus leaving it to the Commissioner to be responsible for such remuneration pending a determination of the liability of the relevant person.' In Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 194, Hill J cited the passage from the judgment of Waddell J including that quoted above, and said (at 204): 'I am in complete agreement with what is said by Waddell J.' 56 In my opinion the Court has the power to order the examination of a party on the adequacy of a disclosure affidavit provided pursuant to an order of the Court under s 1323 of the Corporations Act . In Corporate Affairs Commission v Smithson, Waddell J said (at 554): 'What then can be done to enforce an order made under s 573 for the appointment of a receiver of all of the property of a relevant person? Such an order should, I think, ordinarily be accompanied by an order having the effect of requiring the relevant person to file in court an affidavit listing all his property and a further order having the effect of requiring him to transfer or deliver all of it to the receiver. If the relevant person fails to comply with such orders proceedings could be taken against him for contempt of court or, in my opinion, an order could be made under the Supreme Court Rules 1970 , Pt 43 , r 1, for him to attend before an officer of the court and be orally examined on such questions concerning or in aid of the enforcement of the order as may be specified in the order for examination. Under that rule he can also be required to produce documents.' 57 The Court may make such ancillary orders in support of its disclosure requirements as are necessary to enable the receivers it has appointed properly to discharge their functions. The power to do so derives from s 23 of the Federal Court Act , if from no other source. That power may well have a wider application than the power to make orders ancillary to a Mareva or other injunction in proceedings between private parties. The Court could, as an incident of its power to appoint receivers, require a relevant person to present himself or herself for examination by the receivers or ASIC before a Registrar in order to ascertain the extent and nature of the person's assets. The use of a disclosure affidavit is not required in every case. It is simply a mechanism to the same end. The Court is not confined to directing the filing of a disclosure affidavit and only if that is inadequate directing oral examination of the deponent. 58 In my opinion there is a real possibility that the disclosure affidavits sworn by Mr Carey have failed to disclose the full extent of assets and property owned or controlled by him or in relation to which he has an interest. The term 'control' used in Order 4 is to be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning and not limited to property in which he has a legal or beneficial interest."

In the absence of transcript or other suitable evidence, I cannot infer that the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing or errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants. I can ascertain no breach of s 425 of the Act. See generally Soltanyzand v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1168 at [18] . 23 The appellants did rely upon part of the transcript said to be ""carried out by"" the appellant husband. However, the appellant husband himself required an interpreter for the Tribunal hearing and before me. The Federal Magistrate considered this issue and implicitly found that the evidence of the transcript carried out by the appellant husband was not probative. The asserted errors in translation are based on the opinion of a person whose understanding of English was not of a sufficient level to undertake the task of translation. 24 To be accepted as having any probative value, evidence would need to be led by a person competent in English and Indonesian to indicate the matters that had been mistranslated or not translated at all. This has not been done. I can find no merit in the first ground of appeal."

Case24666,followed,Ocean City Ltd v Southern Oceanic Hotels Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 86 ; (1993) 10 ACSR 483,"Lanepoint submits that there is a genuine dispute as to the amount of its indebtedness to WIF. In an appropriate case the Court may exercise its discretion to determine such a dispute rather than to stay the winding-up application to await the curial resolution of the dispute: Ocean City Ltd v Southern Oceanic Hotels Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 86 ; (1993) 10 ACSR 483 at 486-487. A great deal of evidence was adduced in this respect including detailed cross-examination of, amongst others, Mr Carey, Ms Karen Carey and Mr Gregory Nairn, a former senior Lanepoint executive. No suggestion was made that there was other relevant evidence available going to the resolution of this question. If such an alleged dispute is raised and can be resolved during such an application then in my opinion it ought to be. It would only add to the costs of the parties as well as to the public to put it off. Lanepoint submits that the affidavit of ASIC's expert, Mr Honey, sworn on 27 October 2006 confirms the following: (i) The work in progress on the Regency Motel redevelopment was, as at 31 January 2006, about $7 million. That work in progress is also estimated by Ernst &amp; Young at $6,544,235 according to the affidavit of Mr Fraser, one of Lanepoint's receivers, sworn on 11 March 2008, based on information provided but that the Receiver and Managers were not able to determine the final quantum of renovation costs."" (ii) In relation to liabilities as at 31 January 2006, the Suncorp Metway loan stood at $4,855,000 and WIF at $2,267,000. (iii) There were intercompany loans to Westpoint, Keypoint and Keyworld at $864,000 but there were other sources of finance of some $700,000"

Case1839,cited,Interline Hydrocarbon Inc v Brenzil Pty Ltd [2005] QSC 109,"(For similar statements considering the purpose of an award of security for costs, see Lord Aldborough v Burton (1834) 2 My &amp; K 401, 39 ER 997; Harpur v Ariadne Australia Ltd (1984) 2 Qd R 523 at 530; Re Energy Drilling Inc (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Gummow J, 3 May 1989) at [24]; Microcorp Pty Ltd v Terran Computers Pty Ltd (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Northrop J, 26 June 1992) at 16; Phoenix Court Pty Ltd v Melbourne Central Pty Ltd [1998] 753 FCA (19 June 1998); Silveira v Australian Institute of Management [2001] FCA 1358 at [6] ; Rocter Tanks Pty Ltd v Adam [2001] SASC 196 at [25] ; Fiduciary Ltd v Morningstar Research Pty Ltd (2004) 208 ALR 564; Wollongong City Council v FPM Constructions Pty Limited [2004] NSWSC 523 at [19] ; La Rosa Constructions Pty Limited v PWR Developments Pty Limited [2004] NSWSC 235 at [7] ; Baygol Pty Ltd v Huntsman Chemical Co Australia Pty Ltd t/a RMAX [2004] FCA 1248 at [9] ; Interline Hydrocarbon Inc v Brenzil Pty Ltd [2005] QSC 109 at [34] .) 38 In my view an award of security in respect of future costs in this matter is appropriate. In forming this view I take into account the following factors: 1. The first and third applicants were ordered earlier this year to pay the first and second respondents security for costs up to the end of the first day of trial in the sum of $150 000: Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93. To paraphrase Emmett J in Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1475 at [26] , for reasons I detail below I do not see any reason at all to depart from the view of the Full Court in making an order that security for costs were payable, and note that the Full Court did not preclude a subsequent application at an appropriate time. 2. The first and third applicants have admitted that they are unable, from their own resources, to meet any costs order made against them in these proceedings. This admission of the applicants means that under both s 56 Federal Court Act and s 1335 Corporations Act the Court has a broad discretion, fettered only by the requirement that the Court act judicially, to order the applicant to give security for the payment of the respondent's costs (Branson J in Hopeshore Pty Limited v Melroad Equipment Pty Limited [2004] FCA 1445 at [3] ). 3. The application was filed and served on 22 November 2006 once it was clear that the trial would not finish on 24 November 2006, and the matter has been adjourned until May 2007. There is no issue of delay in respect of this application in respect of future costs. 4. Although the courts have shown reluctance to order security for future costs in respect of part-heard trial, on the basis that, if the applicant cannot provide security, it runs the risk of having wasted costs of the trial days already heard, the fact that the length of the proceedings was not foreseen is a factor which may influence the court to exercise its discretion in ordering security for those costs (see comments of Street CJ in Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308). 5. In my view it is not appropriate to form any views as to the strength of the applicants' case at this stage of the trial (cf comments of Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) ATPR 40-972 at 50,636). It is clear however that there are triable issues, and it has not been suggested to me that the case of the applicants is frivolous. 6. Insofar as this application is concerned, it is clear that the first and third applicants are unable to satisfy a costs order. I do not need to go to the evidence which has been heard to be so satisfied. Further, in my view the impropriety of reaching conclusions in this respect works both ways clearly the respondents strongly deny that their conduct has caused the impecuniosity of the first and third applicants (indeed it is a basis of the litigation), and in my view it is not proper at this stage when some, but not all, of the evidence has been heard, to make any findings as to this issue. I believe it is acceptable, however, to note evidence given in Court by Mr Hambleton, the administrator under the third applicant's deed of company arrangement, that in his opinion there was a strong prospect that the third applicant was insolvent from incorporation (TS 23 November p 572 ll 24-25). 7. Although the applicants contend that the reliance by the respondents on previous material filed in respect of security for costs is a tacit admission that nothing has occurred to justify this application for security for costs, I cannot accept that contention. Plainly, circumstances have altered. A trial which was listed for 10 days being the best estimate of Counsel as communicated to the Court is now manifestly running over that time. I shall consider this issue later in this judgment in relation to quantum. However I fail to see how the respondents, in relying on evidence of Mr McLellan that the costs for each day beyond 10 days would be $8166, is a tacit admission of the kind submitted by the applicants, notwithstanding that the affidavit of Mr McLellan was filed 27 March 2006. In my view the only 'admission' of the respondents in this respect is that their trial costs beyond 10 days would not exceed $8166 per day, and would not increase in the 2007 calendar year. 8. There is no evidence before me that the effect of an order awarding security for costs would be to stultify the litigation. Indeed as was clear during the hearing it would be the second applicant, Mr Tracy, who would be providing any security for costs ordered (TS 23 November 2006 p 585 ll 25-27). As pointed out by Jessup J in Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 at [49] , there is an intrinsic connection between the 'stultify factor' and the 'persons standing behind' factor as described by Beazley J in KB Cable . That the second applicant and his wife, Mrs Adrienne Tracy, are principal beneficiaries (and in the case of the second applicant, the principal architect), of the litigation before me is also clear from the evidence (for example TS 17 November 2006 p 194 ll 31; TS 17 November 2006 p 219 ll 41-43; TS 20 November 2006 p 233 ll 16-19, and exhibit R15). Further, that Mr and Mrs Tracy are of considerable means was made clear from evidence before the Court, including a balance sheet describing assets and liabilities of the second applicant, Mrs Tracy and their companies as at 12 November 2004 (exhibit R14). The first and third applicants appear to be impecunious, however there is no evidence before me that the second applicant or Mrs Tracy are at a similar financial disadvantage notwithstanding the events which have resulted in the litigation before me. No undertakings have been provided by the second applicant or any other person as to the costs to which the first and third applicants may become liable. Accordingly in such circumstances security for costs may be ordered to ensure that those who stand to benefit from the litigation undertake some of the risks.

The case was argued on the basis that it involved, as does this case, an allegation of unconscionable conduct comprising the knowing exploitation by one party of the special disadvantage of another. The idea of special disadvantage was propounded in Berbatis Holdings [2003] HCA 18 ; 214 CLR 51 as ""... a disabling circumstance seriously affecting the ability of the innocent party to make a judgment in [that party's] own best interests"". Gleeson CJ accepted that formulation as ""... consistent with what the Act calls the unwritten law concerning unconscionable conduct, bearing in mind that the Act also allows for the development of the law from time to time"" (at [5]). The Chief Justice went on to say, referring to the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Samton Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 62 ; (2002) 117 FCR 301 that (at [11]): A person is not in a position of relevant disadvantage, constitutional, situational, or otherwise, simply because of inequality of bargaining power.

Case17912,applied,"BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] FCA 336 ","In BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] FCA 336 , Kiefel J said at [3]: Penalties for contempt of Court orders necessarily recognise that the Court's authority must be vindicated, and that there is a public interest in compliance with all orders of the Court: Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 , 533 . Orders for penalties recognise the need to deter not only the defaulting party, but others who might be like-minded. 53 In BHP Steel , Kiefel J observed at [22] that persons who prosecute contempt cases are often recognised as performing a public duty and an order for indemnity costs is made so that they are not out of pocket in taking that role. 56 As Sir Robert Megarry VC said in EMI Records at 984, indemnity costs are commonly ordered in contempt cases. The same practice is adopted in Australia, for reasons which include those stated by Kiefel J in BHP Steel .

Owston submits that on ASIC's case, no liability will be established on the part of Owston should ASIC be successful and points to the fact that ASIC does not seek recovery of damages in a representative capacity for shareholders, nor does the pleaded contravention give rise to a civil penalty. It claims that the relief sought is an advisory opinion on a purported contravention of the Act and does not quell any controversy between the parties. Here, Owston relies upon Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 161 ALR 399 and Re McBain; Ex parte Australian Catholic Bishops Conference [2002] HCA 16 ; (2002) 209 CLR 372 at [61] - [62] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ. The majority of the members of the High Court in Re: Judiciary and Navigation Acts explained that ""a matter under the judicature provisions of the Constitution must involve some right or privilege or protection given by law, or the prevention, redress or punishment of some act inhibited by law"" (at 266). Owston contends that in light of the statutory scheme there is no right, privilege or protection given to ASIC which is sought to be enforced, nor is the relief sought in the nature of preventative relief, or redress, or a punishment. I do not accept Owston's submissions. In my opinion, the present proceedings fall within the majority's several alternative descriptions of ""matter"" in Re: Judiciary and Navigation Acts. They concern the rights and protections conferred by s 727 of the Act as well as the redress available under ss 1324B and 1337B of the Act and under s 21 of the Federal Court Act and s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act for contraventions of s 727 of the Act. Re: Judiciary and Navigation Acts is not authority for the proposition that for a ""matter"" to exist, a claim of civil penalty or for recovery of damages or some relief which undoes the wrong must be present, or that somehow the proceedings must ensure finality of litigation by ensuring that there is no real possibility that another plaintiff will commence proceedings in relation to some or all of the issues in the proceedings. Nor is it authority to support a contention that bare declaratory relief which does not meet or aid one of those ends will not ordinarily be granted. Involved in this proceeding is at least the question of the right of investors to receive a prospectus under the provisions of the Act and the corresponding duty of Owston to provide one. Owston is liable to the declaratory relief sought. These are sufficient."
Case11195,cited,Isle of Wight Tourist Board v Coombes [1976] IRLR 413,"As regards the application of the principles, there are several instances where a single incident of verbal abuse has given rise to a successful claim for constructive dismissal.

In Courtaulds Northern Textiles Ltd v Anderson [1979] IRLR 84 an assistant manager said to an employee: ""You can't do the bloody job anyway"", not believing this to be true. Again constructive dismissal was established. In Robinson v Compton Parkinson Ltd [1978] ICR 401 an employee who was falsely accused of theft was found to have been ""constructively dismissed"".

Moreover, the circumstances must be such that a reasonable person would accept the representation as an invitation to act upon it in a particular way. It must be causally linked to the decision of the party to whom it is made to act upon it to that party's detriment. See generally Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394. 148 Next, it might be thought that any representation embedded in that ""assurance"" involved a promise as to future conduct and not a statement as to an existing state of affairs: Legione v Hately ; Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher (1988) 164 CLR 387 at 398 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, at 415 per Brennan J, at 459 per Gaudron J; and Commonwealth v Verwayen at 499-500 per McHugh J.

Case6741,referred to,Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353,"submits that the agreement falls under the first category of agreement identified in Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353 such that the parties have agreed all terms and intend to be bound immediately but propose 'to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect'. Like FMG, Forrest submits that the agreement was a binding first agreement for the build, finance and transfer of the railway, with a further agreement to be executed at a later date. ASIC submits, however, that the most noteworthy aspect of the agreement is the absence of agreement on critical matters, and the complete absence of detail about other matters. ASIC makes the following submissions regarding the terms of the CREC Framework Agreement in support of its contentions that the agreement was a bare agreement to negotiate the scope and terms of a further contract to build, transfer and finance the infrastructure, and that it did not impose any legally enforceable obligations: (a) CREC was not obliged to actually build or transfer the railway; (b) there was no agreed price in the agreement nor any mechanism to achieve or confirm a price; (c) there was no definition of the scope of the works to be performed; (d) there was no provision for choice of contractors or the selection of materials; (e) there was no definition of ""practical completion""; (f) there were no specifications for any design elements of the infrastructure. I will deal with each of these in turn. Was CREC arguably obliged to actually build or transfer the railway? In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games 18 NSWLR 540 Gleeson CJ, with whom Hope and Mahoney JJA agreed, confirmed at 584E-F the importance in a Masters v Cameron type of dispute of assessing the parties' intention to make a concluded bargain, and stated that the question of intention is distinct from, although it may be closely related to, the question whether the parties have reached agreement upon such terms as are, in the circumstances, legally necessary to constitute a contract. His Honour stated: Nevertheless, in the ordinary case, as a matter of fact and commonsense, other things being equal, the more numerous and significant the areas in respect of which the parties have failed to reach agreement, the slower a court will be to conclude that they had the requisite contractual intention. Jobern [2007] FCA 1066 involved a contractual dispute where the parties had executed a document entitled 'Heads of Agreement' (HofA), clause 3.3 of which stated: ""Each party will conduct all such negotiations in good faith to ensure that the terms set out in these Heads of Agreement are given full effect"". It was not in dispute in Jobern that the parties were bound by the HoFA, which Gordon J stated to be a final agreement within the first category described in Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353 at [106] . However Gordon J considered that cl 3.3 was uncertain because it suffered from the same problems referred to by Kirby J in Coal Cliff Collieries 24 NSWLR 1 at [130]. In Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353 , Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ explained in a joint judgment that where parties who have been in negotiation reach agreement upon terms of a contractual nature and also agree that the matter of their negotiation shall be dealt with by a formal contract, the case may belong to any of three classes, the first two involving binding contracts (360): (1) The parties have agreed all terms and intend to be bound immediately but at the same time propose 'to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect'; (2) The parties have agreed all terms but intend to make performance of one or more terms conditional on the execution of a formal document; (3) The intention may be not to make a concluded bargain at all unless and until the parties execute a formal contract. The judgment went on to explain that the question depends upon the intention disclosed by the language the parties have employed (362.5) and that there is no formula, such as ""subject to contract"" which is so intractable as always and necessarily to produce a result that there is no binding contract (363.6). The courts have also recognised a fourth class of case additional to the three mentioned in Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353 , a class identified by Knox CJ, Rich J and Dixon J in Sinclair, Scott &amp; Co Ltd v Naughton [1929] HCA 34 ; (1929) 43 CLR 310 at 317 as: ... one in which the parties were content to be bound immediately and exclusively by the terms which they had agreed upon whilst expecting to make a further contract in substitution for the first contract, containing, by consent, additional terms. This fourth category was recognised by McLelland J in Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 622 and on appeal in G R Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 631 where McHugh JA delivered the Court of Appeal's judgment and observed that the magnitude, subject matter or complexities of a transaction may indicate that an agreement was a limited one not intended to have legal effect (634D) but that what was critical was the parties' intention objectively ascertained, and that this intention should prevail (634E-F). In Uranium Equities Ltd [2008] WASCA 33 ; 36 WAR 97 , the Supreme Court of Western Australia (Court of Appeal) stated at [129] that the fourth Masters v Cameron category was a variation of the first category. In Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair [2008] NSWCA 248 , the NSW Court of Appeal emphasised that determining whether parties have come to a concluded agreement is a matter of their objectively ascertained intention in the particular case. Giles JA stated that the Masters v Cameron categories and a possible fourth category are intellectual aids, and that categorisation does not greatly contribute to the decision in the particular case, which is concerned with finding what agreement, if any, the parties came to, [26]. Similarly, in Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd [2009] QCA 60 , Keane JA, with whom McMurdo P and Atkinson J agreed, said at [37] in relation to classifying the putative agreement in that case under one of the four Masters v Cameron categories: In my respectful opinion, however, there is little purpose to be served in seeking to resolve the issue of classification. A concern as to classification should not be allowed to obscure or distract from the real task of the court which is to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the parties. Keane JA referred to Sir Anthony Mason's opening address to the Journal of Contract Law 20 th Anniversary Conference ((2009) 25 Journal of Contract Law 1, 6): ... [T]he categories (or classifications of Masters v Cameron ((1954) [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353) , be they three or four, are no more than exemplifications of the general principle that, in the case of written documents, the intention of the parties is to be resolved objectively and as a matter of construction of the relevant documents. The categories are necessarily subject to the general principle. The question therefore, which is of paramount importance here is whether or not the parties to the framework agreements intended them, objectively, to be legally binding. In Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 , the issue was whether a binding contract for Anaconda, a company interested in lateritic nickel, to explore and mine for base metals on the tenements of Tarmoola, a company interested mainly in gold, had been made when a heads of agreement containing five clauses was signed, the last paragraph of which said that the heads of agreement ' constitutes an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form' . Tarmoola argued that there was no intention to contract, no agreement on essential terms, and that the agreement was incomplete and uncertain. By majority, the WA Full Court rejected these arguments and held that the heads of agreement was a binding contract. Ipp J (with whom Pidgeon J agreed) found that contractual intention was present. His Honour endorsed the existence of the fourth Masters v Cameron category in stating: It is well recognised that parties may enter into a valid contract containing a limited number of terms comprising those terms essential to the bargain that they wish to conclude, in the expectation that at a later date a further contract will be arrived at containing additional terms that would facilitate and clarify the initial contract. That is to say, a binding contract may be arrived at even though it leaves unresolved many matters which might arise in future. [25] His Honour found that the agreement was neither incomplete nor uncertain such as to render it void or such as to indicate that the parties did not intend to enter into legal relations, and that the agreement contained all the essential terms required for a legally binding agreement. The omission to deal with particular future problems such as water did not make the agreement uncertain or incomplete: these issues could be resolved by processes of construction and implication: [79]. His Honour stated that the parties' failure to enter into a more detailed agreement may have made the exploring and mining operations contemplated by the heads of agreement more expensive, difficult and complex, but he did not accept that it was unworkable in the sense of it being objectively impossible for performance of its terms to be effected: [95]. In dissent, Anderson J noted that the trial judge had found this case to be in the third Masters v Cameron category, that is, a case in which the terms of the heads of agreement were not indtended to have and therefore did not have any binding effect of their own, and he agreed with the trial judge that the parties did not intend the heads of agreement to have binding effect as their concluded bargain ([121]-[124])."
Case6317,cited,Sent v John Fairfax Publication Pty Ltd [2002] VSC 429,"Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248 ; (2001) 4 VR 501 ( 'Spincode' ) at 521-524 [52]-[58], Brooking JA identified three possible grounds for restraining a solicitor or counsel from acting for a particular party to litigation: the danger of misuse of confidential information; a breach of a fiduciary duty of loyalty not to act against a client, or against a former client in the same matter or a closely related matter; and the inherent jurisdiction of the court to control the conduct of solicitors and counsel as officers of the court. These three grounds represented the orthodox legal position in Australia prior to the decision of the House of Lords in Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a firm) [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222 ( 'Bolkiah' ) which held that the duty of loyalty did not survive the termination of the relationship with the client. Brooking JA's analysis in Spincode has been consistently followed and applied in Victoria: see Sent v John Fairfax Publication Pty Ltd [2002] VSC 429 ; Pinnacle Living Pty Ltd v Elusive Image Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 202 ; and Adam 12 Holdings Pty Ltd v Eat &amp; Drink Holdings Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 152.

Case21336,considered,Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice [1995] 4 All ER 511,"In Gartner v Carter; In the Matter of Gartner Wines Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 258 , Lander J concluded that communications between a client and a legal adviser for the purpose of the client putting assets beyond the reach of the legitimate claims of secured creditors is a 'fraud on justice'. His Honour at [130] said that such a purpose 'is a fraud on the creditor and there is no public interest in protecting that communication'. Lander J followed the decision in Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice [1995] 4 All ER 511. Schiemann LJ (with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed) said at 524 that, because the relevant transactions involving the disposition of assets at undervalue were intended to prejudice the interests of the secured creditor, the '... purpose [was] sufficiently iniquitous for public policy to require that communications between [the client] and his solicitor in relation to the setting up of these transactions be discoverable. If that view be correct, then it matters not whether either the client or the solicitor shared that view. They may well have thought that the transactions would not fall to be set aside ... either because they thought that the transactions were not at an undervalue or because they thought that the court would not find that the purpose of the transactions was to prejudice the bank. But if this is what they thought then there is a strong prima facie case that they were wrong. Public policy does not require the communications of those who misapprehend the law to be privileged in circumstances where no privilege attaches to those who correctly understand the situation.'"
Case15048,cited,Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101,"It is, therefore, essential, in appeals brought under s 44 of the AAT Act , that a question or questions of law be identified. If the notice of appeal fails to disclose a question of law the necessary subject matter of the appeal is lacking. The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 76 ALD 321 at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 248 ALR 456 at 465-468. In Birdseye Branson and Stone JJ held (at 325) that: ""... O 53 r 3(2) discloses an intention that a question of law to be raised on an appeal from the tribunal should be stated with precision as a pure question of law.

Case9780,followed,Wilson v Anderson [2002] HCA 29 ; (2002) 213 CLR 401,"In any claim for determination of native title, or for compensation for loss or impairment of native title rights and interests, the NTA is 'determinative': Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 (' Yorta Yorta (HC) ') , at [32], [70]. Accordingly, even if native title was extinguished under common law rules which are taken to have applied prior to the commencement of the NTA , it is still necessary to consider the application of the statute (and its State and Territory counterparts) to any act said to have extinguished native title: Wilson v Anderson [2002] HCA 29 ; (2002) 213 CLR 401 , at [45]-[47], per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ. 53 In Wilson v Anderson , Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed (at [51]) that s 23J(1) of the NTA : 'has the effect of conferring upon native title holders an entitlement to compensation only where the statutory extinguishment exceeds the extinguishment that would have occurred at common law. The evident purpose of s 23J is to limit, so far as possible, the entitlement to compensation under s 23J, to cases where the ""act"" is invalid by reason of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ... and is subsequently validated by s 14 of the NTA or s 8 of the State Act [equivalent to s 4 of the Validation Act ]. However, s 23J also may be attracted in respect of a valid ""act"" which, although satisfying the definition of ""previous exclusive possession act"", would not completely extinguish native title at common law. That a different result may be reached under Div 2B of Pt 2 of the NTA or Pt 4 of the State Act [equivalent to Parts 3B and 3C of the Validation Act ] emphasises the point that it is the statutory criteria provided for by those provisions which are to be applied when determining issues of extinguishment.' (Emphasis added.) 54 Section 10(1) of the RD Act (the terms of which are reproduced at par 102, below) may operate to confer a right to compensation upon native title holders where a State or Territory law has failed to make the right universal by denying it to the native title holders. For example in Ward (HC) , the High Court held (at [253]) that s 10(1) of the RD Act conferred a right to compensation on native title holders for the loss of their rights by the creation of a reserve pursuant to a State statute. The RD Act conferred a right to compensation because under State law the only interests that were destroyed without compensation by the creation of the reserve were those of the native title holders. In such circumstances, the creation of the reserve was valid and could not be a 'past act' validated by legislation corresponding to Div 2 of Part 2 of the NTA . The effect of s 10(1) of the RD Act , however, was that the native title holders were entitled to compensation. 55 Section 45 of the NTA is concerned with a right to compensation which arises in such circumstances. It provides as follows: '(1) If the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 has the effect that compensation is payable to native title holders in respect of an act that validly affects native title to any extent, the compensation, in so far as it relates to the effect on native title, is to be determined in accordance with section 50 as if the entitlement arose under this Act. Recovery of compensation (2) If the act took place before 1 January 1994 and is attributable to the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the native title holders may recover the compensation from the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory, as the case requires.' 560 A number of other propositions were endorsed in Ward (HC). They were recently summarised in De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (' De Rose (FC) (No 2) '), at [145], as follows: (the references are to paragraphs in Ward (HC) ). '(i) Native title rights and interests are properly to be seen as a bundle of rights, the separate components of which can be extinguished separately (at [76]-[77]). (ii) Where a grant of rights in land is made pursuant to statute, the question (so far as extinguishment is concerned) is whether the rights are inconsistent with native title rights and interests in respect of the land [(at [214])]. This is an objective inquiry which requires identification of and a comparison between two sets of rights, one deriving from traditional laws and customs and the other from 'the new sovereign authority that came with settlement' (at [78], [82]). Reference to the use of land is relevant only to the extent that it focuses attention upon the rights pursuant to which the land is used (at [78]). (iii) Rights held under an interest in land less than a fee simple estate, such as a lease, can be inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests and therefore can extinguish them (at [80]). (iv) There is no such thing as degrees of inconsistency of rights: ""Two rights are inconsistent or they are not. If they are inconsistent, there will be extinguishment to the extent of the inconsistency ... Absent particular statutory provision to the contrary, questions of suspension of one set of rights in favour of another do not arise "" ( at [82]). (Emphasis added.) (v) Section 23G(1)(b)(i) of the NTA contemplates that a previous non-exclusive possession act, such as a pre- RD Act pastoral lease, may grant rights and interests that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests and extinguish the latter (at [192]; see, too, Wilson v Anderson, at [46]). Where that occurs, no question of suspension of native title arises. (vi) Section 23G(1)(b)(ii) of the NTA addresses the case where there is an inconsistent grant of rights which, apart from the NTA and its State [or Territory] counterpart, would not extinguish native title rights and interests. The example given is a post-1975 grant which, by operation of the RD Act , was ineffective to extinguish native title rights and interests (at [82]). (This seems to involve reading the expression ""the grant of rights"" in s 23G(1)(b) as including a purported grant, given that the RD Act would, apart from the NTA , presumably render the grant invalid.)' To these six propositions derived from Ward (HC) two others can usefully be added: (vii) Reference to the use of land in the context of extinguishment may distract attention from the true inquiry, namely whether rights have been created in third parties that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests. Use of land may suggest, or even demonstrate, that such rights have been created, but the basic inquiry is about inconsistency of rights, not use (at [215]). (viii) The metaphor of a 'bundle of rights' is useful in two respects: 'It draws attention first to the fact that there may be more than one right or interest and secondly to the fact that there may be several kinds of rights and interests in relation to land that exist under traditional law and custom' (at [95]). (Emphasis added.) 769 This view receives support from the observations concerning s 23J made by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Wilson v Anderson . Their Honours said this (at [51]): 'Sub-section (1) of s 23J has the effect of conferring upon native title holders an entitlement to compensation only where the statutory extinguishment exceeds the extinguishment that would have occurred at common law. The evident purpose s 23J is to limit, so far as possible, the entitlement to compensation under s 23J , to cases where the ""act"" is invalid by reason of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ... and is subsequently validated by s 14 of the NTA or [equivalent State or Territory legislation] . However, s 23J also may be attracted in respect of a valid ""act"" which, although satisfying the definition of ""previous exclusive possession act"", would not completely extinguish native title at common law. That a different result may be reached under Div 2B of Pt 2 of the NTA or Pt 4 of the State Act emphasises the point that it is the statutory criteria provided for by those provisions which are to applied when determining issues of extinguishment'. Their Honours' observations proceed on the basis that s 23J of the NTA creates an entitlement to compensation in cases where an act is invalid by reason of the RD Act but is subsequently validated by s 14 of the NTA or a State or Territory counterpart. Such an act presumably would be a 'past act' as defined in s 228(2) of the NTA as well as a 'previous exclusive possession act' as defined in s 23B of the NTA. 770 This construction of Div 2B of the NTA does not leave Div 2 without any work to do. Not all past acts are previous exclusive possession acts for the purposes of Div 2B of the NTA. For example, the grant of an estate is not a previous exclusive possession act if the grant involves the establishment of a national park for the purpose of preserving the natural environment: s 23B(9A). Yet such a grant may vest a right of exclusive possession in the grantee which is capable of extinguishing native title rights and interests: Ward (HC) , at [258]. If the grant was invalid under the RD Act by reason of its effect on native title, it could be a past act (s 228(2)) and could be validated by s 14 of the NTA. The effect on native title of the grant would be determined by s 15 of the NTA and the entitlement to compensation would arise under s 17. 771 As Mr Hughston pointed out, this construction of Div 2B accords with what will often be the practical realities and avoids what otherwise would be strange consequences. Previous exclusive possession acts include grants of fee simple estates or leases and the construction of public works. Some of these acts may have been invalid when done by reason of the RD Act (and thus would have been 'past acts'), but this would not have been known at the time. The practical consequences of these acts usually would have included the de facto loss or impairment of native title rights and interests. It makes sense that any right to compensation in respect of the validation of those acts is to be determined as at the date the acts took place."
Case16127,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fox Symes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1071,"The power conferred on the Court by O 11 r 16 is to be exercised to ensure that a party complies with the rules of pleading ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fox Symes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1071 ( 'Fox Symes' ) at [95]). Ordinarily the party should be given an opportunity to replead in accordance with the rules ( Fox Symes at [95]). However, if a party's pleading is repeatedly struck out, it may be inferred that the party is unable to plead a reasonable cause of action as required by the rules ( Fox Symes at [109]). 12 The principal rules of pleading are, for present purposes, to be found in Orders 11 and 12 of the FCRs. Order 11 r 2 provides: 'Subject to these Rules (a) a pleading of a party shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party relies, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved; (b) paragraph (a) has effect subject to this Order and to Order 4 (which relates to commencement of proceedings) and to Order 12 (which relates to particulars).'

Case10806,cited,Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] 1 NSWLR 68,"There is a well-known line of authority to the general effect that it is the province of directors, not the courts, to identify where the interests of a company lie, and that the courts do not exercise a supervisory function over the business judgments of directors: see, for example, Harlowe's Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co NL [1968] HCA 37 ; (1968) 121 CLR 483 at 493; Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821 (PC) at 832. Unlike a company's power to issue shares with which the cases just cited were concerned, the power to agree to the inclusion of a break fee provision in a complex contract of the TID kind, being sui generis , is even less apt to being circumscribed by any more detailed rules than the general duty expressed in s 181(1)."
Case14285,cited,Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co Limited (1931) 48 WN (NSW) 236,"It will be observed that the reference to 'reasonable' remuneration is a gloss upon the words of the Act and is described by his Honour as arising from 'necessary implication'. That implication may, no doubt, be given effect to in the operation of s 449E(2) but is of doubtful relevance to the construction of s 449E(1). There is much else of relevance in the judgment in Stockford which is too lengthy to reproduce but some other passages repay reproduction. His Honour said (at [24] and [30] [31]): 'The natural meaning of the word ""fix"" in the context of an entitlement to ""such remuneration as is fixed by a resolution of [creditors]"" is, so it seems to me, to quantify that remuneration, that is to calculate or ascertain the amount of remuneration: Mayne v Jaques [1960] HCA 23 ; (1960) 101 CLR 169, 173, 174, 180. See also In re Gallard; Ex parte Harris [1892] 1 QB 532, 544. Thus, remuneration will be ""fixed"" if it is stated as a money sum, or is based on a formula which is capable of being applied according to some objective standard so the sum ""can be calculated or ascertained definitely"": Fraser Henleins v Cody [1945] HCA 49 ; (1945) 70 CLR 100, 128. In the case of a formula all the objective elements must be identified. Other cases which support this approach in related contexts include, in Canada: Hill v State (1913) 14 DLR 158, 163; Beuregard v The Queen in right of Canada (1983) 148 DLR (3d) 205, 235; Royal Bank of Canada v Bjorklund (1985) 36 Man R (2d) 54, 59; and in the United States: Zimmerman v Carfield 42 Ohio St 463, 468 (1885); Board of Supervisors of Yavapai County v Stephens 177 P 261, 262 (1919); Culberson v Watkins 119 SE 319, 322 (1923); Woodcock v Dick 222 P 2d 667, 669 (1950); Powers v Isley 183 P 2d 880, 884 (1974). ... 'The question arises whether the approval of prospective fees charged on a time basis amounts to ""fixing"" or ""determining"" the liquidator's remuneration. On one view such approval does no more than fix the rate at which remuneration is to be charged; as the method sets no limit to the amount to be charged it may not ""fix"" the remuneration. At least there must be real doubt about the validity of the practice. It is not, however, a matter which I need resolve, for the issue does not arise squarely on the facts and no submissions were directed to the question. To reach a concluded view would require consideration of, among other things, the knowledge of the practice by Parliament when the Companies Acts were re-enacted or amended. If Parliament knew of the practice and did not change the statute that is relevant to its interpretation. I should say that if the practice be irregular that would not mean that a liquidator must complete his administration before he receives any remuneration. He could be allowed interim remuneration while work is being performed, leaving the precise amount of his remuneration to be fixed when the winding up is complete. In any event, the problem may not be as large as at first it seems. Oftentimes, especially in a complex administration, it will be too difficult to fix fees prospectively having regard to the matters that should be taken into account, as I will later explain. For this reason courts have from time to time refused to fix fees prospectively: for instance Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Company Limited (1931) 48 WN (NSW) 236. Be that as it may, whatever be the correct meaning of ""fixing"" remuneration, it was not ""fixed"" in this case. The resolutions purporting to fix the administrators' remuneration did so by reference to the rates in the administrators' report. According to those rates work performed by persons occupying the same position could attract a different hourly charge. There was no criteria by reference to which one could determine which hourly charge would be applied. In reality it was left to the administrators to decide what the rate would be. In this state of affairs it was the administrators and not the creditors who fixed their remuneration.' [emphasis added] 27 Counsel for ASIC responded to the argument based upon practical inconvenience by suggesting that interim payments could be authorised, as suggested by Finkelstein J in Stockford (at [30]) or that a certain monetary sum could be fixed on the basis that the administrator should have the right to seek further remuneration at a later meeting (cf Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co Limited (1931) 48 WN (NSW) 236).

Case4524,referred to,Damir Travica v The Government of Croatia [2004] EWHC 2747 (Admin),"Court also notes the decision of the High Court of Justice in Damir Travica v The Government of Croatia [2004] EWHC 2747 (Admin) in which Lord Justice Laws considered an issue under s 6(1)(d) of the Extradition Act 1989 (UK), which is in substantially the same terms as s 7(c) of the Extradition Act. In such decision Laws LJ observed at [38] that the Extradition Act 1989 (UK) could not be construed as conferring such a wide power of judgment over the practices of a foreign state as to warrant refusal of an extradition where an applicant will face a fair trial but complains that members of other groups would not have to face trial at all. Accordingly, any discrepancy between the number of Croatians and Serbians prosecuted in the Republic of Croatia is irrelevant in this Court's consideration of whether the applicant would suffer prejudice at his trial by virtue of his race, nationality or political opinion. The applicant's contention does not lead to the conclusion that he would not be afforded a fair trial in the Republic of Croatia. As to the alleged disparity in convictions between Serbians and Croatians, the Court observes that such alleged disparity may be a consequence of the disproportionate number of prosecutions against Serbians compared to Croatians. It is not possible to infer prejudice by the Croatian judiciary based upon the conviction data provided by Mr Strbac since the judiciary has not been involved in the prosecution process which has resulted in the disproportionate number of Serbian convictions. As considered above, discrepancy in the number of prosecutions is irrelevant to the review before the Court. Similarly, any discrepancy in convictions which results from discrepancy in prosecutions is also irrelevant. The Court would need to have before it evidence that the disproportionate number of convictions arose independently of the number of prosecutions before it could be satisfied that there might be a basis for finding prejudice by the judiciary. Reversal of convictions In Travica Laws LJ observed at [34] that the conflict between Serbia and the Republic of Croatia and its after-effects have been 'especially acute In the Krajina region' . However, Laws LJ also observed at [35] that such circumstance did not by itself constitute a claim of prejudice 'not least when set against the signs of improvement in the conduct of prosecutions which I have surveyed, and which cannot have failed altogether to touch the Krajina region' . At [30] Laws LJ also made comment of the 'signal progress made in Croatia towards a justice system which meets international standards' . His Lordship's observations are consistent with the evidence contained in the reports referred to above. Ground 1 - Conclusion The Court has considered the applicant's evidence and finds that there is no specific evidence of pre-trial bias against the applicant, nor is there a nexus established between the applicant's apprehension and the question of whether he would be prejudiced at his trial. Further, the evidence before the Court establishes that the Croatian judiciary is capable of providing a fair trial to the applicant. The Court is not satisfied that the evidence establishes that there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant may be prejudiced at his trial or otherwise prejudiced as provided by s 7(c) of the Extradition Act. Ground 2 Abuse of process"
Case5855,followed,Calder v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 226 ALR 643,The process of identifying a 'tax benefit' is prescribed by s 177C. It requires an assessment of what might reasonably be expected to have happened if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out. This process has been described as the identification of the 'alternative postulate': Hart at [66] and Macquarie Finance Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 ; (2005) 146 FCR 77 at [204] . This is an objective assessment: Calder v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 226 ALR 643 at [95]; Macquarie at [212]; Pridecraft Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2004) 213 ALR 450 at [64]-[65].
Case20419,applied,SZBEL v MIMIA [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592,"The appellant submits that the Tribunal decision is infected by jurisdictional error for failure to comply with s 425 of the Act. The appellant contends that the Tribunal failed to identify the issues that arose in relation to the decision under review and failed to take the steps necessary to identify the issues other than those that the Delegate considered dispositive ( SZBEL v MIMIA [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at [35] ). She says that it failed to ask her to expand upon those aspects of her account that it considered may be important for the decision and may be open to doubt ( SZBEL at [47]). 14 In SZBEL at [36], the High Court observed that an applicant for review of a Delegate's decision would be entitled to assume that the reasons given by the Delegate for refusing to grant the application will identify the issues that arise in relation to that decision, unless the Tribunal tells the applicant something different. At [47], the High Court acknowledged that there may be cases where the Tribunal's statements or questions during a hearing sufficiently indicate to an applicant that everything she says in support of the application is in issue. Where there are specific aspects of an account that the Tribunal considers important to the decision and open to doubt, the Tribunal is obliged to ask the applicant to expand on those aspects and explain why the account should be accepted. 15 As the High Court reaffirmed in SZBEL at [26], the particular content to be given to the requirement to accord procedural fairness will depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The Tribunal is required to identify any issue critical to the decision (at [29], citing Commissioner of Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591 2). In identifying the requisite opportunity to be heard, the applicant is entitled ' to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material ' ( Alphaone at 590-1; SZBEL at [32]). The High Court (at [33]) emphasised the importance of the reference in s 425 of the Act to ' the issues arising in relation to the decision under review '. 16 Section 425 requires that the appellant understand the issues that are relevant to the Tribunal in its function of reviewing the Delegate's decision. Where the Tribunal made it clear that it was ""starting afresh"", the appellant could not have assumed that the reasons given by the Delegate would identify for her the issues that arose in relation to that decision because she was not aware of the content of that decision. Accordingly, the Tribunal made it plain to the appellant that all issues identified in her application for a protection visa and the further issues raised at the hearing were, within the context of s 425 , the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review. ' It is those issues which will determine whether rejection of critical aspects of an applicant's account of events was ""obviously...open on the known material"" ' ( SZBEL at [38]). If every aspect of the claim is in issue or if an issue is made clear to the applicant, it is then open to the Tribunal to accept or reject some or all aspects of the applicant's account ( SZBEL at [39]). 17 The relevant issues can be ascertained from the reasons for the Tribunal decision. The appellant identifies the issues, that she says should have been identified, as relating to: (a) the appellant's practice of her Christian faith in Australia; and (b) the appellant's willingness to risk her livelihood and to endanger her dependent child to assist her friend when the potential consequences of this choice were known to her. 18 The appellant submits that, by reason of s 425 of the Act, the Tribunal was not entitled to relieve itself of the obligation to deal independently with the decision under review, the decision of the Delegate. In circumstances where the Delegate had accepted the appellant as a Christian and made no adverse finding as to her credibility, the appellant contends that she had no reason to believe that she would be disbelieved on this issue. Consequently, the appellant says that she would have been entitled to believe that, on review of the Delegate's decision by the Tribunal, there was no additional issue to be addressed ( SZBEL at [35]). 19 When the appellant told the Tribunal that she was unaware of the Delegate's reasons for decision, the Tribunal did indicate to the appellant that it was looking at the matter afresh, without reference to the Delegate's decision. The issue of the appellant's own practice of the Christian faith, which she began to practise in Australia, was first raised by the appellant at the hearing before the Tribunal. It was not raised before the Delegate. The Delegate's decision was based upon the appellant's claim to be a Christian in China. That was not her claim to the Tribunal. The appellant clearly stated that she was not a Christian while in China. The Tribunal was entitled to consider the claim made to it. Where that conflicted with the basis for the Delegate's decision, the Tribunal was entitled to disregard that decision and the apparent inconsistency in circumstances where the issues before the Tribunal were as presented by the appellant to the Tribunal. 20 The appellant accepts that the Tribunal asked her about her experiences at the Blacktown Screaming Sect but says that at no stage did the Tribunal put her on notice that she would be disbelieved, or that the perceived paucity of the information she provided would be the basis for an adverse finding as to her credit; the Tribunal did not challenge her evidence, express any reaction or invite her to amplify her account. 21 As the issue was raised for the first time before the Tribunal, the appellant should have been in no doubt that it was an issue arising in relation to the Tribunal's consideration and in relation to the decision under review. Therefore, she could not have assumed that it was not in issue because of the Delegate's decision. The Tribunal asked the appellant a number of questions about her understanding of Christianity and her practice of it, to which the appellant responded. The issue was clearly raised. The tenor of those questions made it apparent that the Tribunal did not accept the mere assertion and was testing it. The Tribunal was not obliged to explain its reasoning or its thinking to the appellant. 22 The appellant says that the Tribunal did not specifically tell her that it disbelieved her account of her practice of Christianity. That is correct. However, the practice of Christianity in Australia was not a basis of the appellant's claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution on her return to China. She did not make that claim at the hearing. She spoke of her practice in Australia in response to the question ' are you a Christian? '. Her response was ' I wasn't a Christian when I was at home. I became a Christian after I arrived in Australia '. In her visa application, the appellant said ' I have been regarded as a person to smuggle the illegal Bible from the overseas to China; and it means that I must be arrested by the Chinese government immediately on my return '. That is, it was her past involvement in Bible smuggling and not her present practice of Christianity that founded her claimed fear of persecution. The Tribunal did, however, consider her claim to practise Christianity and rejected it, based on its conclusions about the appellant's credibility. 25 The Tribunal clearly put the appellant on notice that it was having real difficulty in accepting that she would take the risk of being involved in a smuggling operation and being the target of the PSB. Those statements and questions by the Tribunal sufficiently indicated to the appellant that everything she said on this subject was in issue ( SZBEL at [47]). The issue for the Tribunal was whether to believe the appellant. That raised the issue of whether she would have smuggled Bibles in view of the potential risk. The question is whether the fact that she had a business and a dependent child were issues in themselves or factual matters that related to the issue of risk. If they are factual matters that go to the issue arising in relation to the decision under review (ie, risk generally), the Tribunal is not obliged to put each of those factual matters to the appellant. The Tribunal is obliged to inform her of the issue but not of each fact that relates to it. 26 Was the risk to the business and the child, independently of the general issue of risk, important to the Tribunal decision and open to doubt? If so, the Tribunal should at least have asked the appellant to expand on those aspects and to explain why the account should be accepted ( SZBEL at [47]). This is not to require the Tribunal to give the appellant a ' running commentary ' upon its thinking ( SZBEL at [48]). 27 There is no doubt that the Tribunal considered it important that the risks involved with smuggling Bibles weighed against the appellant's asserted reason for engaging in that activity. That reason was that her friend, with whom she had a commercial arrangement, had assisted her financially to establish a business. The existence of risk was an important factor in the rejection by the Tribunal of the appellant's claim to have been involved in the smuggling. After stating the various factors, the Tribunal said that: ' the Tribunal does not accept that armed with this knowledge ', that her friend had had to flee the country and another person had been sentenced to three years in a labour camp, ' that the [appellant] would take the risk of being involved in a smuggling operation that had been the target of the PSB '. After stating this conclusion, the Tribunal noted that the appellant had a business and an eleven year old dependent child and said that it ' cannot accept that the [appellant] would become involved in this activity given her knowledge of the adverse consequences of this type of activity '. 28 In the context of the Tribunal decision, the business and the child were not the issues on which the decision to reject the appellant's claim were based. They were not determinative but additional factual matters that elaborated the matters to be balanced against the risk. The key point in the Tribunal's assessment was the fact that there was a risk to the appellant and, in those circumstances, it did not accept that there was sufficient reason for her to take such a risk. The appellant was directed to that issue at the hearing, asked about it and told that the Tribunal found it difficult to accept her evidence. The Tribunal did not fail to comply with s 425 of the Act in this regard."
Case15412,cited,Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99,"Australia Post contends that the Tribunal forgot or overlooked the fact that Dr Burke and Dr McGill gave oral evidence, did not therefore deal with that evidence and accordingly failed to consider the case put by Australia Post. The evidence was referred to in submissions to the Tribunal. The Tribunal made no reference to the oral evidence of Dr Burke or Dr McGill. Australia Post submits that the Tribunal may have forgotten about the evidence in view of the time that elapsed between the evidence and the decision. Australia Post says that this gives rise to jurisdictional error or denial of natural justice because of the risk that the capacity of the Tribunal for competent evaluation of the evidence was diminished by the timeframe and the delay between the evidence and the decision ( NAIS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470 at [10] - [11] per Gleeson CJ, [106] per Kirby J, [172] per Callinan and Heydon JJ). This would also give rise to an error of law. 101 Mr Sellick submits that where an appeal lies under s 44 of the AAT Act, applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act should be dismissed unless the subject of the appeal is a decision going to practice and procedure. He relies on Duong v Australian Postal Corporation (2005) 41 AAR 288 at [12] where Edmonds J dismissed an ADJR Act application where the Tribunal decision did not go to practice and procedure. His Honour followed Tuite v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [1993] FCA 71 ; (1993) 40 FCR 483 where Davies J had held that, as s 44 of the AAT Act provides a specific procedure for the granting of relief by the Court in respect of decisions of the AAT, that procedure should be adopted and applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act, where an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act is available, should be dismissed as of course (at 484). Justice Davies expressed the view at 484 that questions of law as provided for in s 44 of the AAT Act encompass grounds enunciated in s 5 of the ADJR Act. Duong was decided prior to Etheridge , a decision of the Full Court and Tuite was decided prior to Birdseye, which discussed the difficulties in the framing of questions of law . Further, the ADJR Act is not only available for matters of practice and procedure ( Bond at 337 per Mason CJ; Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 at [89] [90] per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ)."

Case24181,discussed,Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333,"In their letter of 15 March 2006, which was headed ""without prejudice save as to costs"", the solicitors for Mr Rambaldi and Irlmond made an offer to resolve the proceeding and invoked Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333 ("" Calderbank ""). Under the Calderbank principle, costs may be awarded on an indemnity basis where a proceeding is unduly prolonged by an imprudent refusal of an offer of compromise: see Colgate-Palmolive at 233 per Sheppard J. A party may rely on a Calderbank offer notwithstanding that the party has not complied with the procedure set out in O 23 of the Federal Court Rules : see, for example, Smallacombe v Lockyer Investment Co Pty Ltd (1993) 42 FCR 97 at 101 per Spender J; Alpine Hardwoods (Aust) Pty Ltd v Hardys Pty Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 121 at 124-125 per Weinberg J; and Henderson v Amadio Pty Ltd (No 3) [1996] FCA 184 per Heerey J. 25 Mr Rambaldi's submissions did not specifically invoke the principle in Calderbank . There may be a number of reasons for this. First, it may be that the offer did not amount to a genuine offer of compromise. The offer, which was stated to be open until noon on 16 March 2006, was made on the basis that Mr Spalla discontinue the proceeding as against Mr Rambaldi and Irlmond and provide full releases to them; that he also make appropriate arrangements with the first to eighth respondents (as they then were) to discontinue; that Mr Spalla, Mr Rambaldi and Irlmond each bear their own costs of the proceeding; and that there be no order as to costs including no order as to any reserved costs. In Vasram v AMP Life Limited [2002] FCA 1286 , Stone J held (at [12]) that where a respondent invited an applicant to discontinue with no order being made as to costs, the invitation could not be regarded as a Calderbank offer: see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) (2002) 201 ALR 618 at [59]-[60] per Hill J. In any event, even if the offer was in the nature of a Calderbank offer, the rejection of the offer would be only one factor to be taken into account in the Court's exercise of discretion. Further, in order for there to be an indemnity costs order, the respondents would need to show that Mr Spalla's rejection of their offer was so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs: see, for example, Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281 at 287-290 per Hely J. As I have said, Mr Rambaldi did not seek to rely on the Calderbank principle and to discharge this onus."
Case7849,applied,Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22,"Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at para 24, Kenny J, with respect, offers a very helpful summary of circumstances in which a court will permit further evidence to be given. Her Honour lists four categories in which she opines that, broadly speaking, a court may grant leave to reopen. Her Honour is careful to note that these classes or categories are not exhaustive and overlap. The four classes that her Honour identifies by reference to authority are: (a) fresh evidence; (b) inadvertent error; (c) mistaken apprehension of the facts; and (d) mistaken apprehension of the law. As her Honour notes in para 24: In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to reopen."
Case13678,applied,New South Wales v Canellis &amp; Ors [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309,"The principle in Dietrich was explained in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ in New South Wales v Canellis &amp; Ors [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309 (' Canellis ') in the following terms (at 328): '... the principle established by the decision in that case is that a court has jurisdiction to grant an adjournment or order a permanent stay of proceedings at a trial until such time as an indigent person charged with a serious criminal offence is provided with legal representation necessary for a fair trial or resources for such representation.' 12 This reasoning of the joint judgment in Canellis has been applied in numerous cases. 13 In McGibbon v Linkenbagh (1996) 41 ALD 219 at 228 Kiefel J said: 'The principle established by Dietrich v R [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 109 ALR 385; 177 CLR 292 as to the use of a court's inherent powers to stay or adjourn proceedings until legal representation is obtained, where it concludes it is necessary for a fair trial, refers only to criminal proceedings: New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 124 ALR 513, 522; Williams v Official Trustee (1994) 122 ALR 585, 600 . It is not authority for the proposition that in other proceedings or inquiries such a step would be required by dictates of fairness, even where someone faced potentially serious consequences.' 14 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leelee Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1121 , Mansfield J said (at [61]): 'The principle recognised in Dietrich ... is a feature of the entitlement to procedural fairness, but it is confined to serious criminal proceedings. That decision was not intended to apply in respect of civil proceedings: New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309 at 328-329 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ.' 15 In Nguyen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1265 ; (2000) 101 FCR 20, Sackville, Marshall and Lehane JJ in a joint judgment said (at [22] [24]): 'The limited scope of the principle in Dietrich was recognised by the High Court in New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309. In that case, the issue was whether a stay should be granted of an inquiry under s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) because of doubts concerning the guilt of a convicted person. The question arose because the State had refused to pay the costs of legal representation for certain witnesses required to appear before the inquiry. The joint judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ observed (at 328) that the principle established by Dietrich ""is that a court has jurisdiction to grant an adjournment or order a permanent stay of proceedings at a trial until such time as an indigent person charged with a serious criminal offence is provided with legal representation necessary for a fair trial or resources for such representation. As the majority judgments made clear, that principle is based on, and derives from, the accused&#180;s right to a fair trial"". 17 In Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v La Rosa (2002) 196 ALR 139, Nicholson J considered that the Dietrich principle did not apply in the context of a hearing before the Aministrative Appeals Tribunal, stating (at [120]): ' Dietrich decided that the common law of Australia does not recognise the right of an accused person to be provided with counsel at the public expense but the courts have power to stay criminal proceedings that will result in an unfair trial. In Nguyen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 101 FCR 20the Full Court of the Federal Court held that the Dietrich principle had no application in the circumstances of a decision of a tribunal in deportation proceedings: see [17] and [18] of Nguyen . There the court referred to the decision in New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309; 124 ALR 513 where the limited scope of the Dietrich principle was recognised, Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ stating it was concerned with the right to a fair trial of a party to criminal proceedings: at CLR 328. The Full Court in Nguyen considered it was clear the High Court did not favour the extension of the Dietrich principle into the field of administrative review.' 20 In Vranic v Chief Executive Officer Centrelink [2004] FCA 1511 , the applicant submitted that she had been denied procedural fairness because she was not legally represented at the hearing before the trial judge. Cooper J rejected this submission, stating at [8]: 'Procedural fairness in a civil proceedings (sic) does not require that legal representation be provided to a party at trial: New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309 at 330; Stuart v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 96 ATC 4960 (FC) at 4964.'"
Case13756,cited,Gudjala People # 2 v Native Title Registrar [2008] FCAFC 157,"In these circumstances the Court of its own motion listed the matter for a directions hearing on 9 April 2008. At that directions hearing the Court directed the parties to file and serve submissions in relation to the disposition of the application pursuant to s 190F(6) of the Native Title Act on or before 7 May 2008. Subsequent to this date and in light of the Full Court's decision in the matter of Gudjala People # 2 v Native Title Registrar [2008] FCAFC 157 delivered on 27 August 2008, parties were invited by the Court to file and serve any further submissions prior to the hearing of the application. 5 On 21 May 2008 the applicant filed submissions in relation to all the Collard applications currently before the Court today ('the Collard Submissions') pursuant to the Order of the Court made on 9 April 2008. 6 The effect of the Collard submissions across the applications appears to be to the effect that the Court should not dismiss them under s 190F(6) of the Native Title Act because they are likely to be withdrawn in exchange for some form of recognition by the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council. It is not said in what way that is to be achieved or the terms in which it might be achieved. Somehow, it is said, it would recognise the status of Mr and Mrs Collard who are the Applicants."
Case1895,considered,Master Builders Association (Vic) v Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders' Labourers' Federation (1981) 35 ALR 284,"Secondly, and this is perhaps no more than a development of the first matter, the travel patterns allowance is payable irrespective of whether in fact the worker incurs additional expense or suffers inconvenience. Under cl 38.1.2 a fixed amount is payable per day and the amount is not calculated by reference to how far a worker must travel. Of a broadly similar clause, the Full Court of this Court said in Master Builders Association of Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders' Labourers' Federation (1981) 35 ALR 284 (' Master Builders Association ') at 289: 'Under cl 16.1 each employee is entitled to what is described as a ""fares allowance"", but the justification for the payment of that allowance is stated to be: ""... for travel patterns and costs peculiar to the industry which include mobility requirements on employees and the nature of employment on construction work."" The fares allowance is determined at a fixed amount per day and is to be paid irrespective of whether the employee incurs any expense in travelling between his home and his particular place of work and return. An employee whose home is alongside his then place of work is just as entitled to be paid the fares allowance as an employee who may be forced to travel many kilometres at great expense from his home to his place of work.' 38 Thirdly, the travel patterns allowance is payable when a worker is employed on 'work' and the case turns, or largely turns, on the meaning to be attributed to the word work in this context. The word is used not only in cl 38.1.2 of the award but also in cl 38.10.1. 39 It seems to me that although the matter is not clear, the terms of the award support the interpretation advanced by the respondent, namely, that apprentices attending trade school are not entitled to the travel patterns allowance. I say that for two reasons. First, if one has regard to the purpose of the travel patterns allowance, the payment of the allowance to a worker who attends trade school does not seem to be within that purpose. In the case of trade school, the location of the place the worker is required to attend does not vary. I think that point holds good even though I recognise that the allowance itself is not calculated by reference to actual cost incurred or inconvenience suffered. Secondly, although the meaning of the word 'work' will vary, depending on the context, I do not think that one would ordinarily consider that an apprentice attending trade school was employed on 'work'."
Case19536,cited,Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations v Barker (1997) 81 FCR 53,"my opinion, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is mentioned or referred to in the ACC Act in general terms , such that the deeming provision in s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act is engaged. I have reached that conclusion for a number of reasons. First, there are some authorities that touch on s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act and, so far as they go, they suggest that there is no distinction of the type advanced by the applicant: Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories (Aust) Ltd v Secretary, Department of Community Services and Health [1989] FCA 384 ; (1990) 22 FCR 73 at 75 per Gummow J; Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations v Barker (1997) 81 FCR 53 ; Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752 at [44] per Bennett J; Gazal Apparel Pty Ltd v Davies (2007) 247 LSJS 391 at 396 [35] per Doyle CJ. Secondly, the subject of what is to be mentioned or referred to in general terms is not the office or position itself, but the person holding or occupying a particular office or position. There is no reason why that should be restricted only to those cases where the person is a member of a class of persons. The distinction suggested by the applicant seems to me to be an artificial one. It is not obvious why the deeming provision in s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act would apply in the case of a deputy commissioner of an organisation, assuming there were two or more deputy commissioners, but not apply in the case of the commissioner of an organisation, or why it would not apply to a person lower down in the hierarchy of an organisation who happens to be the only holder of a particular office or position. Such, however, are the consequences of the interpretation of s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act proposed by the applicant. Finally, the interpretation of s 20 which I think is the correct one, will not frustrate or impede the intention of Parliament because the deeming provision itself does not apply if a contrary intention appears in the relevant legislation. I should add that I do not think the ACC Act reveals a contrary intention in this case."

Case23094,applied,Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525,"Deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: see Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 106-107 (' Mudginberri ') and 112-113. However, the disobedience will amount to a criminal contempt if it involves 'deliberate defiance or, as it is sometimes said, if it is contumacious': see Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 (' Witham ') at 530. As is apparent from the Statement of Charge, Louis Vuitton is alleging both civil and criminal contempt. However, as all proceedings for contempt are now regarded as criminal in nature, all of the charges must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: see Witham at 534. 33 Criminal contempt is an indictable offence at common law: see John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v McRae [1955] HCA 12 ; (1955) 93 CLR 351 at 364. However, civil contempt constituted by the mere failure to comply with an order or a deliberate, but not contumacious, breach of an order was traditionally regarded as a matter for the parties, rather than for the courts. Thus, traditionally, the dichotomy between civil and criminal contempt claims had the consequence that civil, but not criminal, contempt may be waived by the aggrieved party: see Witham at 533 and 540, Poj &eacute; v Attorney-General of British Columbia [1953] 1 SCR 516 (' Poj &eacute;') and Gompers v Buck Stove &amp; Range Co 221 US 418 (1911) (' Gompers '). 37 However, the traditional approach that enabled that outcome may need to be revisited in the light of Witham in which Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ (at 532-534) observed: 'At best, the distinction between proceedings in the public interest and proceedings which are coercive or remedial in the interest of the private individual supports a separate category of civil contempt to the extent that it clearly appears that the proceedings are remedial or coercive in nature. ... However, in our view, there are fundamental problems even with that approach. One problem is that there is not a true dichotomy between proceedings in the public interest and proceedings in the interest of the individual. Even when proceedings are taken by the individual to secure the benefit of an order or undertaking that has not been complied with, there is also a public interest aspect in the sense that the proceedings also vindicate the court's authority. Moreover, the public interest in the administration of justice requires compliance with all orders and undertakings, whether or not compliance also serves individual or private interests. Nor can the dichotomy between proceedings in the public interest and proceedings in the interest of the individual be maintained on the basis that some cases involve an interference with the administration of justice and others merely involve an interference with individual rights. All orders, whether they be Mareva injunctions, injunctions relating to the subject matter of the suit, or, simply, procedural orders, are made in the interests of justice. Non-compliance necessarily constitutes an interference with the administration of justice even if the position can be remedied as between the parties. Moreover, there is considerable difficulty with the notion that, in some cases, the purpose or object of the proceedings is punitive and, in others, the purpose or object is remedial or coercive. It should at once be noted that the purpose of the proceedings is not the same as the purpose or object of the individual bringing the proceedings and it is well recognised that, notwithstanding that proceedings are brought by an individual to secure the benefit of an order or undertaking, a ""penal or disciplinary jurisdiction"" may also be called into play. It has been held that the ""penal or disciplinary"" jurisdiction may be exercised even when the parties have settled their differences and do not wish to proceed further. Thus, in Canadian Transport v Alsbury , Sidney Smith JA rejected the submission that settlement precluded further proceedings saying: ""Are we to be told that after a party has defied a court, the court can still do nothing because the other party is willing to swallow the contempt? Nothing short of the clearest authority would convince me that that is the law; and there is no such authority and no such law."" And as already indicated, proceedings for breach of an order or undertaking have the effect of vindicating judicial authority as well as a remedial or coercive effect. Indeed, if the person in breach refuses to remedy the position, as is not unknown, their only effect will be the vindication of judicial authority. Given that purpose or object cannot readily be disentangled from effect and given, also, that a penal or disciplinary jurisdiction may be called into play in proceedings alleging breach of an order or undertaking, it is necessary to acknowledge, as it was in Mudginberri , that punitive and remedial objects are, in the words of Salmon LJ ""inextricably intermixed"". Moreover and, perhaps, of more importance, nothing is achieved by describing some proceedings as ""punitive"" and others as ""remedial or coercive"". Punishment is punishment, whether it is imposed in vindication or for remedial or coercive purposes. And there can be no doubt that imprisonment and the imposition of fines, the usual sanctions for contempt, constitute punishment. And the same is true of a sequestration made in consequence of a company's failure to comply with an order or undertaking. The differences upon which the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is based are, in significant respects, illusory. They certainly do not justify the allocation of different standards of proof for civil and criminal contempt. Rather, the illusory nature of those differences and the fact that the usual outcome of successful proceedings is punishment, no matter whether primarily for the vindication of judicial authority or primarily for the purpose of coercing obedience in the interest of the individual, make it clear as Deane J said in Hinch , that all proceedings for contempt ""must realistically be seen as criminal in nature"". The consequence is that all charges of contempt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.' (footnotes and citations omitted) See also McHugh J at 539-541 and 549. 38 Witham did not go so far as to decide that the distinction between civil and criminal contempt no longer existed, although McHugh J observed (at 549) that the 'case for abolishing the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is a strong one'. However, the conclusion that all contempts arising from a breach of a court order are criminal in nature, involve punishment and necessarily involve the public interest in the administration of justice by vindication of the court's authority, plainly undermines the traditional rationale for allowing civil contempt cases to be settled, that rationale being that contempt cases may be settled because they are proceedings in the interest of the aggrieved party that are remedial or coercive, rather than punitive, in nature. 39 The distinction drawn in the majority judgment in Witham between the purpose of a contempt proceeding and an aggrieved party's purpose in bringing a contempt proceeding is significant. It was in that context that their Honours referred to the observation in Canadian Transport v Alsbury (1952) 7 WWR (NS) 49 (which was affirmed on appeal in Poj &eacute;) that it is not the law that a party's willingness to 'swallow the contempt' has the consequence that the court can do nothing about it. As was observed in Poj &eacute; at 520 a contempt may be civil or criminal 'depending upon the nature and quality of the conduct in question in any particular case'. It must follow that, as a claim based inter alia on a breach of a court order has the potential to be a claim of both civil and a criminal contempt, there is some difficulty in purporting to offer to settle, or in settling, the 'contempt' claim. 42 When regard is had to Witham there is some difficulty in contending that a contempt claim is not of public concern and does not involve any interest of a public character. 43 In the present case, I need not go so far as to find that claims of contempt resulting from breach of a court order cannot be compromised or settled; there was no compromise or settlement of the contempt claims that were pressed by Louis Vuitton at the hearing. However, Louis Vuitton made offers to Maskiell to compromise or settle the claims it was entitled to pursue as a result of her re-infringing conduct in breach of the Court's orders. The issue is whether Louis Vuitton's conduct in relation to those offers ought to result in it not receiving any orders for costs and being required to pay for any costs incurred by the respondents in raising issues concerning the propriety of that conduct. 44 Plainly, where conduct is in breach of a court order, but also gives rise to private claims for relief, the private claims may be compromised or settled. However, in the light of Witham , an aggrieved party and its solicitors should exercise prudence and caution when offering to settle claims arising out of the contravening conduct. That is particularly so when they are dealing with a litigant in person. The reason for that is that breach of a court order is criminal in nature, may result in fines and imprisonment and has the potential to constitute a criminal contempt. Accordingly, there is a real risk of impropriety, and possibly illegality, if an offer to compromise or settle the claims of the aggrieved party in respect of the contravening conduct is not reasonably and fairly based on the legal right to relief the aggrieved party has, or may have, in respect of that conduct. In other words, if the threat or prospect of contempt proceedings is used to obtain a compromise or settlement beyond that to which the aggrieved party would be entitled as a matter of law, the threat may amount to improper pressure, duress or even extortion. 45 While the law may be in an uncertain state on this issue, it is plainly prudent that any offer of a settlement or compromise of private claims, which arise out of conduct in breach of a court order, should clearly specify the private claims that are being settled and make quite clear what is intended, or not intended in respect of the contempt claim. For example, a private litigant is not under a duty to prosecute a contempt claim. Therefore, provided that there is still a distinction between civil and criminal contempt, it may not be improper for a party to indicate that, if that party's non-contempt claim is resolved, that party does not intend to prosecute the contempt claim. Further, even if a prosecution has commenced, it may not be improper for the prosecuting party to agree to seek to discontinue the contempt claim provided an adequate disclosure is made to the Court. However, it is clear that, save where the issue of contempt is entirely excluded from the offer, the offer should be limited to matters that fall within, and do not travel beyond, the legal entitlement of the aggrieved party. At the least, the offer should be based on a reasonable and reliable estimate of that entitlement. 46 In that context, I turn to consider the offers made by Louis Vuitton to compromise or settle its claims against Maskiell and Design Elegance arising as a result of their breaches of the consent orders."

The respondent Commissioner lodge with the Court and with the taxpayer applicants draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment within fourteen days, including orders as to costs. 74 More recently in Orica Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 77, Merkel J, as a Federal Court judge at first instance, said as follows (at 87), in the context of a capital gains tax dispute, upon which the taxpayer applicants sought to place additional reliance in support of the same major theme of their present case: 'Issue estoppel has been held not to apply to a taxpayer where the previous decision relied upon as founding the issue estoppel related to a different year of income. Although there was some support for the contrary view in [Hoysted] , that decision was not followed in [Caffoor] . In Caffoor the Privy Council determined that a taxpayer is not estopped from contending it was entitled to an exemption in respect of a year of income by a decision in respect of a different year of income. More recently, in [Chamberlain] Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ cited Caffoor as authority for the proposition that ""the Commissioner is not bound by a determination made in respect of an assessment for one year, so far as other years are concerned"". It must follow that the Commissioner's issue estoppel argument also fails.' The estoppel issue raised in Orica was in the nature of an alternative contention, and arose in the context of the 'relation back' provisions of s 160U of the capital gains tax provisions of the Tax Act and did not occupy the principal focus of attention of those proceedings. It appears that Merkel J was not provided with the substantial scope of juridical references to and analysis of authority that has been presently afforded to the Court by the parties in contest, including that analysis and debate referrable to the High Court's later decision in Queensland Trustees Limited v Commissioner of Stamp Duties [1956] HCA 75 ; (1956) 96 CLR 131, which I will shortly next discuss, or for that matter to Falk . The decision in Orica did not survive appeal (see Commissioner of Taxation v Dulux Holdings Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1344 ; (2001) 113 FCR 436), though the issues of the scope here arising did not feature in the reasons for judgment on that appeal. I will later return to Orica . 75 The Commissioner submitted that Queensland Trustees was indeed 'directly in point'. The case involved an initial assessment of stamp duty made under the Stamp Acts 1884-1940 (Qld) by the Commissioner of Stamp Duties on a transfer of real property from a company controlled by a deceased person as transferor to the trustees of a trust estate as transferees, being an assessment later upheld by the High Court (in re Sharpe (1944) QSR 26). Subsequently the trustees transferred the land to the surviving beneficiary of the trust in accordance with terms directed by testamentary provision, and the Commissioner of Stamp Duties assessed that subsequent transfer to succession duty under the The Succession and Probate Duties Acts 1892-1952 (Qld). The High Court held by majority that the claim by the Commissioner of Stamp Duties should fail on the ground of issue estoppel. It was asserted by the Commissioner of Stamp Duties that it was fundamental to the High Court's decision, which upheld the assessment of stamp duty, that the transferee beneficiary's title derived from the terms of the settlement and not from the will of the testator, the High Court having accepted the Commissioner of Stamp Duties' contention 'that the testator at his death had no interest in the land and no power to compel its transfer to his trustees.' 76 The taxpayer applicants submitted conversely that Queensland Trustees was of no assistance, being '... simply not a tax of one year... and tax under the same Act in another year', but was instead 'tax under two different statutes', one relating to stamp duty in relation to a settlement and the other in relation to death duty, albeit statutes involving the same revenue commissioner; I do not think that so much is of any decisive significance. The taxpayer applicants contended further that Queensland Trustees stands outside the 'directly relevant authorities', being authorities to which I have referred earlier in these reasons and which dealt with annual assessments of income tax, land tax and other duties. Rather Queensland Trustees was said by the taxpayer applicants to have been decided upon the basis that the existence of an issue estoppel had been determined by the Privy Council decision in Hoysted , without reference to the 'contrary decision in Broken Hill ', and further that after the decision in Queensland Trustees , 'Caffoor decisively rejected Hoysted and adopted Broken Hill' . It was acknowledged by the taxpayer applicants that Queensland Trustees was not referred to in Caffoor or Hope, though neither case had of course originated in Australia. The taxpayer applicants further argued on that footing that the decision in Queensland Trustees was not directly in point, and could only 'stand with the line of authority running from Broken Hill to Chamberlain ' on the basis that, unlike those cases, it was not concerned with annual assessments of tax, and further that '[i]n the light of the other decisions, ... including the adoption of Caffoor by the High Court in Chamberlain ', Queensland Trustees should not be regarded as persuasive in the context of a Part IVC appeal on annual income tax assessment. I have of course emphasised the context involved in relation to Chamberlain and the relative briefness of reference made therein to Queensland Trustees. 77 The Commissioner rejoined that although neither Dixon CJ nor McTiernan J made reference in Queensland Trustees for instance either to Hoysted or to Broken Hill in particular , Webb J held that '... the Crown is estopped from questioning the decision in these proceedings between the same parties' , citing at 144 in that regard Hoysted generally. Moreover in the remaining judgment, being that of Kitto and Taylor JJ jointly, the Commissioner asserted that a similar finding was made at 151 as to the operation of estoppel, in the following terms: 'The principle of law which is relied upon is that for which [Hoysted] is the leading authority in the Privy Council. If the Crown is so estopped, the assessment of succession duty cannot stand, for the nomination and schedule was an instrument which operated inter vivos , and the trusts which it stated in favour of the sons were expressed without reference to the death of any person . The case therefore turns upon a question of issue-estoppel.' The conclusion of Kitto and Taylor JJ at 152 was as follows: 'For this reason it must be held that the Crown is estopped by the judgment it obtained in the former proceedings from asserting that the absolute vesting... was the taking effect of a succession conferred by the testator's will. The claim for succession duly must therefore fail.' The Commissioner submitted that the principles of estoppel apply not only to the administration by the Crown of one species of taxation, but to the administration by the Crown generally of all taxes imposed by it. The Commissioner further submitted that the doctrine 'can certainly apply to attempts to re-litigate issues arising under one species of taxation, and in particular, a revenue enactment concerned with annual assessments of tax', and emphasised in that latter context that the Crown in Queensland Trustees was held estopped, in respect of its administration of both the Queensland stamp duty legislation and the Queensland probate legislation. 78 The taxpayer applicants responded by pointing principally to what may be described as the distinction between the single or confined revenue circumstances involved in Queensland Trustees , being revenue in the form of ad valorem stamp duty or instruments or transactions, from those of successive annual (or other periodic) revenue circumstances involving the incidence of income tax or analogous revenues addressed for instance in Broken Hill , Caffoor and Hope . The critical issue presented by the taxpayer applicants consequently was whether or not taxing or rating systems of annual (or other periodic) assessments or exactions allowed room for the operation of issue or similar estoppels in the determination of successive years of income tax. 106 Moreover it is further appropriate to point out that the context and circumstances of the present proceedings are I think significantly distant and removed from those of the authorities relied upon by the taxpayer applicants, being principally of course Broken Hill, Caffoor and Hope , such as to render those authorities of no sufficient assistance here to the taxpayer applicants as judicial precedents. I have drawn attention to those contexts and circumstances in the course of my review of those cases. Moreover as I have earlier discussed in the context of the reasons in the joint judgment I have extracted from the High Court's decision in Falk, there is at least something plausible to be said for the view that Broken Hill and Hoysted are susceptible to reconciliation and thus distinction in operation, and in any event, that Hoysted should be preferred to the extent of any inconsistency. So much would be in line with the observations of the three members of the High Court in Queensland Trustees who reviewed the United Kingdom authorities. Moreover I do not think that the taxpayer applicants gain assistance of sufficient significance here from the relatively brief citation of Caffoor appearing in the joint judgment of three members of the High Court in Chamberlain , for the reasons I have earlier mentioned, which included reference to the proposition that ' the Commissioner is not bound by a determination...' , and thus not contextually to a process of reasoning leading to a substantive determination by a superior court of record. In none of those English authorities moreover was the doctrine of abuse of process, additionally to estoppel, apparently invoked. 112 The taxpayer applicants contended of course for the operation of a per se entitlement to litigate, discretely or cumulatively, in relation to each of the 1991, 1993 and 1994, and apparently also the 1996, fiscal year revenue objections, and the consequential disputes the subject of disallowed objections, in line with those English decisions of high authority. Bearing in mind those distinguishing jurisdictional features, and as the Commissioner moreover rightly observed, if the taxpayer applicants were to be permitted to raise for redetermination each and all of the same substantive issues, or virtually so, that were raised, considered and determined in the earlier Spassked proceedings, albeit that the latter proceedings were geared and related to a different fiscal year (ie 1992), being issues principally as to the purpose of relevant borrowings, and as to the use or otherwise of borrowed funds in activities carried on for the purpose, or otherwise in the course of gaining or producing assessable income, and if the taxpayer applicants were to be successful in any such further proceedings against the Commissioner, there would be on record, as I have already mentioned, what would be inconsistent or substantially inconsistent reasons for judgment of the Federal Court. All that would constitute situations well removed, conceptually as well as contextually, from that involved for instance in Saffron . Moreover there was reversed by the Privy Council's decision in Broken Hill what had been an earlier decision of a Full Bench (by majority) of the High Court of Australia, and there was inconsistency between that decision of the Privy Council and the almost contemporaneous Privy Council decision in Hoysted , involving an appeal which also emanated from Australia . Moreover as has been further mentioned, Hoysted was applied by the Full Court in Chamberlain (though the principal judgment of the High Court in Chamberlain cited Caffoor though briefly and not in any controversial context), and Caffoor and Hope did not involve appeals from Australia. Furthermore Dixon J (as he then was) in Blair v Curran cited Hoysted , not irrelevantly in terms of the scope of principle here the subject of scrutiny. The High Court in Falk , without expressing any preference, pointed to the dilemma in reconciling Broken Hill with Hoysted. More directly of assistance to the Commissioner's case moreover was the favourable approach taken to Hoysted adopted by those three members of the High Court in Queensland Trustees who made reference to Hoysted. In all those circumstances, the emphatic approach adopted by the taxpayer applicants in the present proceedings as to the operation authoritatively of the Privy Council decisions in Broken Hill , Caffoor and Hope might be thought to have at best debateable viability, particularly if account be also taken of the nature and extent of the jurisdiction and functions exercised by the tribunals etc from where at least the litigation in Caffoor and Hope originated."

Justice Merkel at [21] conveniently summarised the relevant principles as follows: The general approach to be adopted in determining the characterisation of an industrial claim is to look at the substance of the demand and to identify the aspect that is central to the claim, or a critical part of it, having regard to the context in which the claim is made: see Re The Amalgamated Metal Workers Union of Australia; Ex parte Shell Co. of Australia Ltd [1992] HCA 38 ; (1992) 174 CLR 345 ("" Shell "") at 358-359. The claim is not to be construed as if it were a document creating legal rights and obligations: see Shell at 359. Finally, a claim can be properly characterised as pertaining to the relationship of an employer and its employees notwithstanding that parts of a claim that are machinery provisions giving effect to the claim (see Shell at 359), or ancillary aspects of it (see R v Portus; Ex parte Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1972] HCA 57 ; (1972) 127 CLR 353 ("" Portus "") at 372), may not pertain to that relationship.

Case5905,referred to,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 605,"the present context the word ""interlocutory"" must be used with caution. Palmer J pointed out in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 605 that when granting an injunction under s 1324(1) or (4) of the Act the Court is not exercising the traditional equitable jurisdiction to grant final or interlocutory injunctions. While considerations that are customarily relevant to the exercise of that jurisdiction may be also relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s 1324(1) or (4), the dominant consideration in cases under the section is the purpose of the provision of the Act that is said to have been contravened. Unfortunately, to a large extent the parties have not joined issue in their submissions. HPM emphasises that the purpose of Pt 5C of the Act is to establish a r&eacute;gime to protect those who contemplate acquiring or have acquired interests in MISs. Counsel for HPM submits that the arrangement established and implemented by the defendants was the very kind of arrangement that the legislature intended should be registered and regulated by Pt 5C. This submission, however, assumes what is to be decided that there was an MIS in the first place. Counsel for the defendants, on the other hand, places heavy reliance on s 564 of the Act. That section expressly contemplates the possibility that a creditor or creditors will indemnify a liquidator and so enable the liquidator to recover property which would not otherwise have been recovered. The section empowers the Court to make such orders as it deems just with respect to the distribution of the property recovered with a view to giving the funding creditor or creditors an advantage over others in consideration of the risk assumed. Counsel correctly points out that the notion of ""creditors"" for this purpose includes contingent creditors. It seems not to be disputed by HPM that the various investor-borrowers are contingent creditors of TROM or Merilbah or of both of them."

Case405,discussed,Re Harry Simpson &amp; Company Pty Ltd and Companies Act 1936 [1964-5] NSWR 603,"The Commissioner relies on the following special characteristics of dividends: (a) that the division of a company's profits among its shareholders by the declaration of a dividend is ""an effectuation or realisation of the rights obtained by the acquisition of the share"" (citing Chief Commissioner of State Revenue (NSW) v Dick Smith Electronics Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 3 ; (2005) 221 CLR 496 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at [25] [26], quoting from the judgment of Dixon J in Archibald Howie Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) [1948] HCA 28 ; (1948) 77 CLR 143 at 153); (b) that in the winding up of a company, debts owed by the company to its members in their capacity as members, including debts arising from the declaration of a dividend, are postponed until all debts owed to, or claims made by, persons other than as members of the company have been satisfied: Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 563A (in 1996 the comparable provision was s 563A of the Corporations Law , which was in identical terms); (c) on an assignment of a debt created by the declaration of a dividend, the debt remains subject to the ""equity"" of the ordinary creditors proving in priority (the Commissioner cites Re Harry Simpson &amp; Company Pty Ltd and Companies Act 1936 [1964-5] NSWR 603 ( Simpson )). 200 The Commissioner's present submission draws attention to certain special features of a dividend debt, and Simpson [1964-65] NSWR 603 exemplifies them. In that case, a company was indebted to shareholders who were trustees of twelve trusts for &#8356;34,471.18s.1d on account of dividends that had been declared. The debt was recorded in the company's books. The trustees notified the company that in accordance with the trusts, a person had elected to become the beneficiary of each trust fund. Accordingly, the company transferred the amount of its indebtedness to the trustees into an account in the name of the beneficiary. 201 Upon liquidation of the company, the beneficiary sought to prove for the debt of &#8356;34,471.18s.1d. The liquidator rejected the proof on the basis that s 200(1)(g) of the Companies Act 1936 (NSW) applied. The effect of that provision was that on a winding up a debt owed by the company to a person in the person's capacity as a member of the company, such as by way of dividend, was, relevantly, deemed not to be a debt payable to that member (cf the postponement now provided for in s 563A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) referred to at [196] above). 202 The beneficiary submitted (1) that the sum owed to her was not by way of dividend, and (2) that she was not a member but an assignee from a member."

Case2349,cited,Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193,"have noted the absence of witnesses capable of giving evidence as to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report, and the lack of opportunity of the respondents to test the contents of the report. This is not, however, automatically fatal to the admissibility of a business record. As Heerey J observed in Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193 at [25] : The terms of s 69(2)(a) do not suggest that it is an essential precondition of admissibility that the ""person"" in question be identified. The ordinary meaning of the language is that it is sufficient that the person who made the representation, whoever he or she is, had or might reasonably be supposed to have had, personal knowledge of the asserted fact. The policy behind the provision is clear enough. Routine business records, made before any legal proceeding arises or is contemplated (cf the exception in s 69(3)) , have an inherent likelihood of reliability which outweighs the common law's aversion to hearsay evidence where the maker of a statement cannot be tested by cross-examination. The utility of s 69 would be greatly diminished if it were necessary to locate among large organisations, perhaps over a long period of time, persons who made representations, often in circumstances where the practical needs of the organisation did not require any identification at the time the representations were made."
Case7867,cited,NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No. 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27,"It was contended by the appellants that his Honour erred in law in finding that some link must be established between the claims expressly articulated by the applicant and other claims that clearly arise on the material before the Tribunal. It was contended that in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No. 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27 at [60] , the Full Court confirmed that a Tribunal is required to consider claims that clearly arise on the material before it when conducting a review, and the Full Court did not limit this requirement to those claims the applicant adopted or which were aligned with the claims advanced by the applicant. 45 It was then contended that his Honour erred in finding that there was no evidence which identified the relationship between the statements of the witnesses and the appellants' claims. It was argued that the relationship was clearly made out by the appellants having requested the witnesses give evidence before the Tribunal and by the content of the witnesses' evidence, and that that evidence contained information specific to the appellants and made specific claims about the consequences the appellants faced if they were made to return to Laos. As such, it was submitted, the learned Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the Tribunal had not failed to conduct a review as required by s 414 when it did not consider all the claims that clearly arose on the material before it. 46 It seems clear to me that whether or not it was obliged to do so, it is apparent from the Tribunal's decision that it did have regard to the evidence supplied by the three witnesses. The content of the material supplied by the witnesses was set out comprehensively in the Tribunal's reasons and the Tribunal's substantive consideration of that material is also apparent. In the relevant passage the Tribunal notes that the witnesses' statements were directed to the likely consequences to the appellants of a return to Laos and concludes that the witnesses 'went beyond giving evidence about matters they had knowledge about and speculated about what they thought would happen to the applicants in Laos'. The witness statements were effectively discounted as being speculative. 47 Therefore, even if the statements did cover claims other than those of the appellants, the Tribunal found the statements were speculative and therefore could not be relied upon. It would not matter then whether the evidence of the witnesses purported to support the claims of the appellants; they were of such quality that the Tribunal could not rely upon them for any purpose, even if they did canvass other claims or matters. 48 In the terms of the Full Court decision in NABE , the claims said to arise out of the letters of the three witnesses were not claims that clearly arose from the material before the Tribunal in view of the evidence's speculative nature as found by the Tribunal. The Tribunal, having reviewed all the material before it, including the unreliability of the appellant husband, gave no weight to the three witnesses the appellants sought to rely upon. This, the Tribunal was entitled to do. 49 It is worthwhile setting out the relevant part of the Tribunal's reasons, which in my view show clearly the approach of the Tribunal as outlined above. The Tribunal notes that Mr Sacsady, Mr Arounsavat and Miss Arounsavat made certain assertions in their letters about what the applicants would face if they returned to Laos which the applicants themselves had not explicitly or implicitly claimed to fear . Mr Sacsady stated that the first and second named applicant had 'declared' themselves to be against communism and would be punished as 'political criminals'. However, the second named applicant has made no such claim. The only fear of harm she claimed to have was related to her husband allegedly accommodating members of the underground group in their home in Laos. She did [not] claim that she would be viewed adversely by the Lao government for any other reason or that she feared harm fro any other reason. Mr Arounsavat stated that if the applicants returned to Laos the first named applicant would not be able to return to teaching, the second named applicant would not be able to continue to operate her business and the third named applicant's education would be negatively affected. No such claims were made by the applicants and in fact the second named applicant stated in the protections visa application that her occupation in Laos was 'home duties'. Ms Arounsavat asserted that the applicants would face certain financial and social difficulties if they returned to Laos. Again no such difficulties were claimed by the applicants. There is nothing in the letters to indicate that the applicants had made such claims to Mr Sacsady, Mr Arounsavat or Miss Arounsavat. Although Mr Arounsavat assisted the applicants with their application and was listed as the applicants' adviser in the review application, he was invited to write to the Tribunal in his capacity as a witness not as an adviser. Further, nothing in his letter indicates that he was advancing the matters referred to in the last paragraph of his letter upon the instructions of the applicants in his capacity as their adviser. The Tribunal concludes that Mr Sacsady, Mr Arounsavat or Miss Arounsavat went beyond giving evidence about matters they had knowledge about and speculated about what they thought might happen to the applicants in Laos . The applicants had the opportunity to make their claims in their protection visa application, in their review application, prior to the Tribunal hearing and at the Tribunal hearing. As they neither explicitly nor implicitly made claims about the above matters raised by Mr Sacsady, Mr Arounsavat and Miss Arounsavat they do not require consideration by the Tribunal. ... On the basis of the above problems with the first named applicant's evidence the Tribunal has concluded that he is thoroughly lacking in credibility and invented the claims that he joined the underground government group. The Tribunal does not accept that he did so or that he assisted the group in any way. Having found him to be an unreliable witness, the Tribunal gives no weight to the second named applicant's evidence or the letters from the first named applicant's father and godfather. There is nothing in the evidence of Mr Sacsady or Miss Arounsavat which indicates that they have independent or personal first hand knowledge of the applicant's involvement with the group thus their evidence is of no weight in that regard. In his written evidence, Mr Arounsavat states '... in knowing that Khongmany has proactively helped his uncle ...'. It is not clear from this whether Mr Arounsavat is claimed to know that the first named applicant was involved with the uncle in Laos because that is what the first named applicant has told him or because he has some other independent knowledge of this. Given that Mr Arounsavat states he came to Australia in 1988 and has not been able to return to Laos it seems unlikely he would have any first hand knowledge that the first named applicant was associated with his uncle's group in Laos. In any event, as the Tribunal has found the first named applicant to be an unreliable witness, it gives no weight to this aspect of Mr Arounsavat's evidence. The Tribunal accepts on the basis of the receipts, the copy of the article and the evidence of Mr Sacsady that the first named applicant joined some Lao organisations in Australia and wrote at least one article critical of the Lao government. However, as it has found the first named applicant to be an unreliable witness who invented his claims about his political activities in Laos, it is not satisfied that he engaged in that conduct other than for the sole purpose of strengthening his claim that he is a refugee . Accordingly, pursuant to s 91R(3) the Tribunal must disregard the first named applicant's conduct in Australia in assessing his claim to be a refugee. (own emphasis added) 50 I do note that the Tribunal did observe that as the appellants did not make claims about certain matters raised by the three witnesses, 'they do not require consideration by the Tribunal'. Having regard to the passages referred to above, this may have been one basis for the decision, but a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons as set out above indicates that the Tribunal did in fact consider the evidence and that the substantive basis for disregarding the evidence was its speculative nature."

However it is critical that the Tribunal does not close its mind to any additional material that might possibly prove probative: see SZGMF [2006] FCAFC 138 at [21] . If the decision maker's mind is closed, ' no hearing really takes place ': see Kanda v Government of Malaya [1962] AC 322 at 337 per Lord Denning MR. Because of the inquisitorial nature of Tribunal proceedings, the threshold for a finding of apprehended bias is necessarily higher than it is in curial proceedings (see NADH 214 ALR at 269 per Allsop J), but it is sufficient if the parties or the public 'might entertain a reasonable apprehension': see Kirby J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia (2001) 178 ALR 421 at [111]. The accepted standard of proof for such finding is one of ' real possibility' : see Livesey 151 CLR at 294."
Case8071,cited,Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in Liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416,"Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings; (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial; (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial; (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

Case17904,referred to,Yap v Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission [2008] FCA 534,"is required pursuant to an order of French J (as he then was) in Yap v Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission [2008] FCA 534. Mrs Yap in those proceedings sought the following relief: Cheshire Securities Pty Ltd ACN 009 264 082 be reinstated and ASIC to compensate the company for its wrongful deregistration on 20 June 2000. Curtin University of WA to reinstate the company's 50-years [sic] LEASE executed on 11 August 1988 between Curtin U (Lessor) Cheshire (Lessee) and CS Yap (Guarantor). Esanda F Ltd to reimburse the company all rents derived from its Student Housing ""Don Watt House"" from 17 November 1988 with interest compounded at Court rate till Judgment and to compensate its Guarantors (Arcola Pty Ltd and CS Yap) for wrongful seizure and sale of their properties. The Registrar of Titles to: a) revert Swan Loc 1978 in CT Vol 1794 Folio 145 back into the name of Yap Cheng See of 57 Whaleback Avenue Parkwood WA, b) revert Swan Loc 73 Lot 6 on Diagram 5694 CT Vol 1590 Folio 117 back into the name of Yap Cheng See of 57 Whaleback Av Parkwood. ANZ and Challenge Bank to reimburse Arcola Pty Ltd rents derived from 58 58A 58B and 60 Second Avenue Rossmoyne from 17 November 1988 with interest at Court rate till Judgment. Challenge Bank to reimburse CS Yap all rents derived from Lot 896/No 235 Preston Point Rd Bicton from 25.5.88 with interest at Ct rate till Judgment. a) Registrar of Titles to revert Lot 337 CT Vol 1773 Folio 274 and Lot 14 on Diagram 23627 CT Vol 1763 Folio 869 back into the name of Arcola Pty Ltd ACN 009 203 838 and b) revert Lot 896/No 235 Preston Point Rd Bicton back into the name of Yap Cheng See of 57 Whaleback Avenue Parkwood. On 31.10.93 CS Yap was declared a vexatious litigant pursuant to SC CIV 2722/02 by Granich &amp; Asso ought to be rescinded for same reason as in par 10 evidence in CSY79. Mrs Yap's application was there supported by an extensive affidavit sworn by her on 5 November 2007. French J described it as ""long and turgid (covering) events dating back to 1987 and which appeared to make allegations of fraud and improper conduct against a variety of parties: Yap [2008] FCA 534 at [2] . His Honour noted in that case that four earlier attempts had been made by Mrs Yap to reinstate Cheshire in the Supreme Court of Western Australia as well as two other unsuccessful applications which were brought by Mrs Yap's son, Mr Chong, again in the Supreme Court of Western Australia at [6-7]. His Honour observed that if Cheshire had any valid claims against any of the respondents before him then they must have accrued prior to Cheshire being deregistered on 13 April 1992 and any cause of action was likely now to be statute barred at [10]. His Honour described Mrs Yap's claims in the affidavit material before him as ""almost unintelligible"". The remedies sought in the application before French J as his Honour observed at [12] substantially depended upon the reinstatement of Cheshire. His Honour was of the opinion that that application had no reasonable prospect of success and was on its face an abuse of process seeking, as it did, to relitigate issues that had been litigated over many years. His Honour further observed that ""if there be, buried in the mound of material that Mrs Yap submits to this Court, some issue which has not been litigated it is not the task of the Court to unearth it"". Mrs Yap's application was then dismissed by his Honour under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and alternatively on the basis that it was an abuse of process. His Honour, satisfied that Mrs Yap had habitually, persistently and without reasonable grounds instituted vexatious proceedings in this and the Supreme Court of Western Australia, directed under O 21, r (1)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Rules that in future Mrs Yap may not institute a proceeding in this Court without the leave of the Court. The history of Mrs Yap's disputes in various courts is set out in Granich v Yap [2004] FCA 1567 at [3] : P Vivante &amp; Co Pty Ltd obtained a default judgment against Mrs Yap in District Court action 1536 of 1989 on 10 April 1989. On 23 June 1992, District Court Registrar Kingsley set aside the default judgment and gave Mrs Yap leave to defend the proceedings provided she paid $39,000 into court by 7 July 1992. Mrs Yap failed to pay the money into court. Mrs Yap appealed the decision of District Court Registrar Kingsley to his Honour Judge Viol. The appeal was heard by his Honour on 3, 10 and 21 August 1992. His Honour dismissed the appeal with costs. Mrs Yap applied for leave to appeal the decision of his Honour Judge Viol to the Full Court of the Supreme Court. On 10 June 1993 the Full Court dismissed her application for leave to appeal and ordered that she pay the costs. Mrs Yap commenced proceedings against Granich &amp; Associates for alleged negligence in District Court action 6202 of 1993. Her action related to the firm's conduct of the District Court proceedings. Her action was dismissed by Commissioner Martin QC on 7 May 1996. He found she failed to prove the firm had been negligent. The solicitors, Granich &amp; Associates, were awarded the costs of the action. Mrs Yap instituted an appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court. That appeal was dismissed on 21 July 1997 for want of prosecution. Mrs Yap was ordered to pay the costs of the appeal. Granich &amp; Associates initiated proceedings in the Local Court to recover legal costs from Mrs Yap. She brought a counterclaim in those proceedings and sought to have it transferred to the Supreme Court. On 24 October 1997, Master Bredmeyer dismissed the action for removal as an abuse of process. Mrs Yap applied for special leave to appeal the judgment of the Full Court to the High Court. The special leave application was dismissed on 22 October 1998 with costs. On 14 December 2001, Mrs Yap applied for judgment in the District Court action which had been dismissed by Commissioner Martin QC on 7 May 1996. The application for a judgment was allegedly based on admissions. It was dismissed with costs by his Honour Judge Wisbey. On 15 March 2002, Mrs Yap applied to the District Court for a retrial of the 1993 action against her solicitors based on alleged fresh evidence. Commissioner Greaves dismissed the application with costs on 22 March 2002."
Case2035,cited,Byrnes v Repatriation Commission [1993] HCA 51 ; (1993) 177 CLR 564,"Repatriation Commission v Deledio [1998] FCA 391 ; (1998) 83 FCR 82 the Full Court explained the method of the application of s 120(1) and (3) at page 91 where the Court said: The method of applying s 120(1) and (3) is now well established: (1) One commences with subs (3). The first step is to identify the hypothesis said to establish the causal link between the veteran's eligible war service and the death, injury or disease. Identifying the hypothesis is a question of fact. (2) The second step under subs (3) is to determine whether the hypothesis is reasonable. The material will raise a reasonable hypothesis if it points to some fact or facts which support the hypothesis (the 'raised facts') and if the hypothesis can be regarded as reasonable assuming the raised facts to be true. In determining whether the hypothesis is reasonable the decision-maker must identify the facts said to point to it. (3) Whether a hypothesis is reasonable is a question of fact. The decision-maker must be satisfied that the hypothesis is reasonable after considering the whole of the material. Proof of facts and onus of proof are not in issue at this point. (4) If the decision-maker concludes that the material raises a reasonable hypothesis, the third step is reached. Subsection (1) must be applied, and the claim will succeed unless one or more of the facts necessary to support the hypothesis are disproved beyond reasonable doubt, or the truth of another fact in the material, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis, is proved beyond reasonable doubt, thus disproving, beyond reasonable doubt, the hypothesis.

Case20874,discussed,The 'Vera Cruz' (No 2) (1884) 9 PD 96,"The early cases such as The 'Vera Cruz' (No 2) (1884) 9 PD 96 and Currie v McKnight [1897] AC 97 appear on their own facts to require a close and direct connection between the damage and the ship as an instrument. Lord Diplock approved these cases in The 'Eschersheim' , but factually applied the phrase more broadly than perhaps was done in those cases. A similarly somewhat broader approach can also be found in The 'Industrie' (1871) LR 3 A &amp; E 303, The 'Chr Knudsen' [1932] P 153 and the The 'Minerva' [1933] P 224."
Case20799,cited,State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] ATPR 41-691,"The principles governing the exercise of the Court's power to summarily dismiss a claim on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, the principles which govern pleadings in this Court and the relevant authorities are conveniently summarised by Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1101 ; (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 415-421. It is not necessary to restate, at length, his Honour's exposition of the relevant rules and the statements of principle which emerge from the cases to which he refers. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to note that: &#8226; The power to dismiss a claim because it discloses no reasonable cause of action will not lightly be exercised: see Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130; Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 at 602-603. &#8226; The purpose of pleadings is to define the issues with sufficient clarity such that respondents understand, and have the opportunity to meet, the case made against them: see Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664; Mitanis v Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd [1997] ATPR 41-591 at 44, 151ff. &#8226; A statement of claim must plead all the material facts necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action. If it does not it is liable to be struck out: Mitanis ; Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712-713. &#8226; It is not sufficient for the pleader to state conclusions drawn from unstated facts: see Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 228 ; (1985) 7 FCR 109 at 114-5. &#8226; There will be cases in which the power to strike out pleadings will not be exercised notwithstanding a failure to plead all material facts. Such restraint will be appropriate where the deficiency causes no confusion and does not raise issues of substantive principle ( HECEC Australia Pty Ltd v Hydro-Electric Corp [1999] FCA 822 at [59] ), and where deficiencies can be overcome by ordering the provision of particulars or the furnishing of affidavits ( State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] ATPR 41-691 at 42,828-9). &#8226; Not all conclusionary pleadings will be struck out as being deficient: see Charlie Carter Pty Ltd v The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association (WA) (1987) 13 FCR 413 at 417. Whether or not such a pleading should be struck out will depend on whether or not the facts are pleaded at too great a level of generality: see Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 557. 40 The result is, to adopt the words of Drummond J in State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] ATPR 41-691 at 42, 834: ""The case presently pleaded by the applicant on the element of loss is not such as to make the connection between the conduct complained of and the loss sought to be recovered ""sufficiently apparent"" in the sense in which that expression was used by Lord Watson in Dow Hager Lawrance v Lord Norreys (1890) 15 App Cas 210 at 221 ... Further explication by the applicant of this part of the claim is therefore required at the pleading stage."" See also Council for the City of the Gold Coast v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd (1998) 157 ALR 135 at 145-6. 51 I have concluded that the SASC should be struck out. In other circumstances it might have been possible to avoid this outcome. A direction to amend might, for example, have overcome the infelicities concerning the pleading relating to the surcharges. Similarly, a direction of the kind given by Drummond J in State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd , requiring the applicant to file a statement which set out how it intended to prove the losses which the applicant and group members are said to have suffered may have remedied certain defects. The failure of the applicant to identify a relevant market or markets is, however, in my opinion, such a significant deficiency in the pleading that, even if such corrective steps were taken, the SASC would remain fundamentally flawed. Not only is this deficiency significant in its own right, it has a consequential effect on the efficacy of other parts of the pleading including, particularly, the identification of the group and the alleged causal link between the implementation of the alleged cartel agreement and the loss and damage said to be caused to the applicant and the group members by the respondents' alleged contraventions of s 45 of the Act . 52 This is the first occasion on which there has been an adjudication on the respondents' complaints as to the alleged shortcomings of the applicant's pleaded case. I am, therefore, prepared to grant leave to the applicant to replead if it wishes to do so. 53 Certain other issues were raised by the respondents in the course of argument which, having regard to the conclusion to which I have come, it is not necessary to deal at any length. Two warrant some attention."
Case4504,cited,Richards v Faulls Pty Ltd [1971] WAR 129,"The Tribunal adopted the view that it was necessary to consider the facts of the particular case to determine whether the conduct in question amounted to serious and wilful misconduct. That is consistent with the approach with the courts have taken to such expressions in the Seafarers Act and in its ancestors and analogues, including under the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897 (UK). See, e.g. Johnson v Marshall Sons &amp; Co Ltd [1906] AC 409. Such an approach has been taken in Australian cases dealing with that expression: see Ismakovich v Broken Hill Pty Company Limited (1982) 49(2) SAIR 209; Comcare v Calipari [2001] FCA 1534 ; Richards v Faulls Pty Ltd [1971] WAR 129; Hills v Brambles Holdings Ltd (1987) 4 ANZ Ins Cas 60-785. That does not suggest, as the applicant contends, that the concept of ""serious and wilful misconduct"" is ambulatory. It simply indicates that the assessment of whether, in particular circumstances, serious and wilful misconduct has been established, is a question of fact to be decided in all the circumstances of the particular case. In my judgment, the Tribunal did not err in law in approaching the matter in that way. 81 Misconduct is serious if it significantly increases the likelihood of serious injury: see Johnson [1906] AC 409; Calipari [2001] FCA 1534 ; Richards [1971] WAR 129. In Hills 4 ANZ Ins Cas 60-785, Green CJ said: For conduct to amount to serious and wilful misconduct it must be such as to give rise to an immediate risk of serious injury, it must be deliberate and not merely a thoughtless act done on the spur of the moment and it must be accompanied by an appreciation of the risk which is involved in it."

Section 483 was then amended in the 2005 Act ('the 2005 amendments'), presumably because of decisions such as S157 ( Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 ; (2007) 228 CLR 651 at [19] ). Clause 39 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 says: Item 27 Section 483 This item repeals section 483 and substitutes a new section. This provides that section 44 of the AAT Act does not apply to privative clause decisions or purported privative clause decisions (inserted by item 14, Schedule 1).

Case9482,cited,Priddle v Fisher &amp; Sons (1968) 1 WLR 1478,"appreciate that a solicitor represented the applicant at the Tribunal. This in itself does not absolve the Tribunal from carrying out the mandate set forth in s 39 of the AAT Act: see, eg, Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 334 , 342-43 per Bowen CJ and Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 , at 326 per Smithers J, and at 342 per Deane J. For instance, a failure of a tribunal to adjourn a matter could constitute a failure to allow a party to present his or her case even if an adjournment was not requested: see Deane J at 342 and Priddle v Fisher &amp; Sons (1968) 1 WLR 1478. On the other hand, I accept that in circumstances where a party is represented there is some onus upon a party to be proactive: see, eg, Schiffer v Pattison [2001] FCA 1094 and Farley-Smith 45 AAR 474 at [54]. However, the solicitor representing the applicant in the circumstances of this case could hardly have been expected to know of the extent of the inadequacy of the translator when the applicant herself was not present to advise him. In an important respect, namely the inadequacy of the translation itself, the solicitor had no basis upon which to be proactive."

Case18190,referred to,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Re; Ex Parte Applicants S134/2002 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2002) 211 CLR 441","The relationship between s 5(1)(h) and s 5(3) has been the subject of a good deal of debate in the authorities: Bond at 355-358 per Mason CJ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 ("" Rajamanikkam ""); SGFB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 422 ("" SGFB "") at [17]-[21] per von Doussa, O'Loughlin and Selway JJ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Applicants S134/2002 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2002) 211 CLR 441 at 458 [35] - [36] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Rajamanikkam and SGFB dealt with provisions in the then Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which were in similar terms to s 5(1)(h) and s 5(3) of the ADJR Act and, in Rajamanikkam , the Justices made it clear that their analysis also applied to the ADJR Act provisions: at 226 [1], 234 [32]-[34] per Gleeson CJ at 240 [54] per Gaudron and McHugh JJ and at 244 [74] and 255 [110] per Kirby J. An important question debated in those authorities is whether the ground in s 5(1)(h) is made out if one of the matters in s 5(3) is established, or the ground in s 5(1)(h) is made out only if there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision and one of the matters in s 5(3) is established."
Case3964,cited,Nolan v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1988] HCA 45 ; (1988) 165 CLR 178 ,"This argument has a number of hurdles in the way of raising unlawful detention to a level of being a cause of action with reasonable prospects of success: (1) First, as Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ observed in Ruddock v Taylor at [40], a majority of the High Court in Shaw held that Re Patterson is not to be understood as overruling Nolan v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1988] HCA 45 ; (1988) 165 CLR 178, but even it were to be so understood ""... what were reasonable grounds for effecting the respondent's detention did not retrospectively cease to be reasonable upon the Court making its orders in Patterson or upon the Court later publishing its reasons in that case. ... Patterson said nothing about the validity of s 189."" (2) Second, as noted by the majority in Shaw (at [35]), in Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Te [2002] HCA 48 ; (2002) 212 CLR 162 four members of the High Court agreed that there was no single strain of reasoning in the majority judgments in Re Patterson which contains a binding statement of constitutional principle and that there were differing views in the majority as to what were the facts material to the decision. One of those four Justices, McHugh J, concluded that Re Patterson had no precedent value beyond its own facts. A little later (at [39]) the majority said: ""That case [Re Patterson] henceforth should be regarded as authority for what it decided respecting s 64 of the Constitution and the constructive failure in the exercise of jurisdiction by the Minister."" See too the respondents' submissions at [8(8)] [8(10)] above. Third, the idea that Mr Coleman's detention was unlawful from 10 March 2003 until the High Court handed down its decision in Shaw on 9 December 2003 when the applicant effectively conceded that it thereupon became lawful, flies in the face of the principle of the retrospective operation of judicial lawmaking, so that even if Re Patterson changed the law, Shaw changed it back with retrospective operation. As Sackville J, with whom Foster and Lehane JJ agreed in Torrens Aloha Pty Ltd v Citibank NA (1997) 72 FCR 581, observed at 594G: ""In the absence of a doctrine of prospective overruling, changes in the law offered by judicial decisions are not confined to events or transactions occurring after the date of the decision changing the law. Doubtless from a historical perspective, this owes a good deal to the declaratory theory of law ..."""
Case12420,applied,"Keating v Morris &amp; Ors (Moynihan J, Supreme Court of Queensland, 1 September 2005 unreported)","It was submitted by Mr Anthony Morris QC for Mr Cooper that, as I had previously expressed adverse views as to the credit of some witnesses in the matter, there may be a perception of apprehended bias and I should therefore consider disqualifying myself from hearing the application for security for costs. I have considered the principles set forth in the decision in Keating v Morris &amp; Ors (Moynihan J, Supreme Court of Queensland, 1 September 2005 unreported) at [32] - [47]. It does not follow simply from my rejection of certain evidence and preference for other evidence that, without more, there is any basis for a perception by a reasonable informed observer that I may be perceived to be affected by apprehended bias on this application for security for costs. Therefore, I reject this submission. 8 The record companies have filed an affidavit by Mr Michael Williams, solicitor for the record companies, dated 22 March 2006. The file number on the copy of this affidavit on the Court file does not refer to the number assigned to the particular appeals, but to the number assigned to the matter at first instance. In my view, nothing turns on this, as the affidavit was accompanied by two notices of motion, one in NSD 61 of 2006 and the other in NSD 150 of 2006 in identical terms. I mention these matters because counsel for E-Talk and Mr Bal has contended that it is inappropriate, without a Court order, that evidence on one application for security for costs should be evidence on the other. I do not accept this submission and I make an order that, since the evidence relates to both applications, it may be used in each. 9 Counsel for E-Talk and Mr Bal also submits that evidence in the affidavit of Mr Williams which does not pertain to the circumstances of E-Talk and Mr Bal should be rejected as against them. I accept this submission, and I have read and used the affidavit only in relation to the particular appellants in question. The form of the affidavit makes it clear which paragraphs relate to each of the appeals and which relate to common matters."
Case15856,cited,Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 154,"of fact are generally not susceptible of challenge unless the manner of their making gives rise to a question of law: Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 154. The question of whether the Tribunal has isolated the relevant legal test is plainly a question of law. The question of whether the Tribunal has applied a correctly identified test or in applying the test so identified, has in fact applied a different test, is a question of law. The question of whether facts found fall within the statute properly construed is generally regarded as a question of law: Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Miahi 65 ALD 141, Sundberg, Emmett and Finkelstein JJ said this: [34] The question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law. Likewise, the question whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law. That is because, before the inference is drawn, there is a preliminary question as to whether the evidence reasonably admits a different conclusion. Accordingly, in the context of judicial review, the makings of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. On the other hand, there is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact. Even if the reasoning whereby the court reached its conclusions of fact were demonstrably unsound, that would not amount to an error of law. A party does not establish an error of law by showing that the decision-maker inferred the existence of a particular fact by a faulty process, for example by engaging in an illogical course of reasoning. Thus, at common law, want of logic is not synonymous with error of law. So long as the particular inference is reasonably open, even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place."
Case9291,referred to,Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589,"native title determination application does not comply with s 61 of the NTA if it is clearly established that it is not made by a native title claim group.

Case1487,referred to,Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229,"The power of the Court to make orders for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). A successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to an award of costs: see, e.g., Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 97 per McHugh J (dissenting in result) and 120-1 per Kirby J. The power to make orders for costs is, however, discretionary, although it ""must be exercised judicially and not against the successful party except for some reason connected with the case"": see Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 ("" Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) "") at 234 per Black CJ and French JJ. Ordinarily, if a successful party is denied an order for costs in whole or part, it is because the party's conduct of the proceeding in some respect or respects makes it just or reasonable to do so: see, e.g., Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) at 236 and Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 544 per Mason CJ."
Case5971,applied,Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1980-1981) 148 CLR 150,"that a question arises as to whether or not undertakings should be accepted, reference should also be made to the guidance offered by Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ in their joint judgment in Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1980-1981) 148 CLR 150 at 164-165: An undertaking to the court is given in lieu of an injunction and, if broken, is treated as the equivalent of an order for the purpose of enforcement; it may therefore be enforced in the same manner as an injunction Milburn v Newton Colliery Ltd; London and Birmingham Railway Co v Grand Junction Canal Co; In re National Federated Electrical Association's Agreement; Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd. As an undertaking is given in lieu of an injunction and is enforceable in like manner, the principles which govern the grant of an injunction by a court must guide it in deciding whether it should accept an undertaking. Limitations which affect the court's jurisdiction or power to grant a final injunction must be observed in the acceptance of an undertaking when it is offered as a substitute for a final injunction. The court cannot escape such limitations by the expedient of accepting an undertaking in lieu of an injunction. The court cannot put itself in the position of enforcing conduct which it has no capacity to command or compel. No doubt the Federal Court has power to accept an undertaking at an interlocutory stage when the undertaking is reasonably related to the orderly procedure of the Court or to the subject matter of the litigation, ... even though it is not in a form which falls within s 80. But, ... this does not justify the conclusion that the Court has power to accept an undertaking by way of final disposition of the case when the Court lacks power to make a final order in that form and the effect of the undertaking is to restrain conduct which the Court has no power to restrain. In general the court must, in deciding whether it will accept from a defendant an undertaking to which the plaintiff takes no exception, be guided by the principles which apply to the making of a consent injunction ...

Case14264,cited,Winglide Pty Ltd v Corporate Express Inc (1999) 46 IPR 627,"The final question is whether the service of bringing together handbags, wallets and purses for sale is a service ""closely related"" to backpacks or whether it is ""of the same description"" as the service of bringing together backpacks for sale. I think these claims are hopeless. I do not understand how it can be said that the service of bringing handbags, wallets and purses together is ""closely related"" to backpacks. There is no relationship between the two. In my opinion, speaking generally it is only when retailing services consist of supplying the very goods in respect of which it is said the services are related that the services and goods will be closely related: see Warnaco US Inc v Estee Lauder Cosmetics Ltd (2001) 50 IPR 143, K Mart Corporation v Artline Furnishers Supermarkets Pty Ltd (1991) 23 IPR 149. Put another way, I cannot imagine that the public would expect the same business to supply handbags, wallets and purses as well as backpacks: Winglide Pty Ltd v Corporate Express Inc (1999) 46 IPR 627, 630. For much the same reasons, I reject the submissions that the service of bringing together handbags, wallets and purses for the benefit of customers is a service ""of the same description"" as the service of bringing together backpacks for sale and that handbags, wallets and purses are goods ""closely related"" to that service."
Case13791,referred to,Murray Halstead v CTS Quality Building Products Pty Ltd (in liq) (2006) NSWSC 1022,"Mr Fernon SC, who appears this morning for the plaintiffs, has referred me to a line of authorities which reveals the dispute.

Case10211,applied,TEC &amp; Tomas (Australia) Pty Ltd v Matsumiya Computer Company Pty Ltd (1984) 1 FCR 28,"SAP Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1821 , 169 ALR 1 , French, Heerey and Lindgren JJ thus observed (citations omitted): [51] ... it was rightly observed that misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce is not limited to conduct which induces or is likely to induce entry into a transaction. So to propose would be to limit s 52 of the TP Act in a way not justified by its terms. Conduct which misleads a customer so that, under some mistaken impression of a trader's connection or affiliation, he or she opens negotiations or invites approaches may be misleading or deceptive even if the true position emerges before the transaction is concluded ... In reaching these conclusions, one of the decisions relied upon by their Honours was the earlier decision of Beaumont J in TEC &amp; Tomas (Australia) Pty Ltd v Matsumiya Computer Company Pty Ltd (1984) 1 FCR 28 at 37 to 38. His Honour there recognised as follows that misleading conduct at the outset may be a "" door opener "": The fact that ""Seiko"" is a household name, at least in respect of watches, confirmed by the experience of the respondents that the name ""Seiko"" has been a ""door opener"" in marketing terms, indicates that a potential purchaser of computers may well commence to deal with the respondents in circumstances where he would not have done so if the respondents had made no mention of ""Seiko"" in its trade or business name and in advertising. In my view, to induce the introduction of such a dealing is conduct which contravenes s 52, even if, ultimately, the consumer becomes aware that the equipment he is purchasing is not that of the Hattori Seiko group, the deception having occurred at an earlier stage: what is relevantly induced is the dealing or the negotiations, as distinct from the subsequent purchase itself. As Taco's case held, there is no reason why s 52 cannot apply to the earlier inducement, even if, as Puxu's case held, the conduct in respect of the purchase itself does not offend s 52 because, by then, the consumer knows or ought to have known that he is purchasing a product other than that of the Hattori Seiko group."

Rather the Court considers that there is a possibility that a different result would be reached on such remitter: see Santa Sabina College v Minister for Education (1985) 58 ALR 527 at 540; and Nguyen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 88 FCR 206 at 213-214."
Case21654,discussed,Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis and Goldstein Ltd [1966] HCA 81 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254,"The second preliminary point is whether the mark ""Colorado"" was used as a trade mark by Colorado Group or by Woolworths Corporation, the United States parent. In support of a submission that the use was by Woolworths Corporation alone, Strandbags Group relies on a passage from Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis and Goldstein Ltd [1966] HCA 81 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254, 271: ""[W]e have no doubt that when an overseas manufacturer projects into the course of trade in this country, by means of sales to Australian retail houses, goods bearing his mark and the goods, bearing his mark, are displayed or offered for sale or sold in this country, the use of the mark is that of the manufacturer. Indeed, in this case, the respondent is the only person who has the right to use the mark and the retailer to whom the goods have been sold for re-sale does not, in any relevant sense, use it."" 29 In my opinion that case does not support the argument. In the first place Estex established only that when a foreign owner of an Australian trade mark sells imported goods bearing the mark and the goods are then sold in Australia the foreign owner uses the mark in Australia. The case did not consider whether the local retailer also used the mark: Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670, 688. In the second place there is little similarity between the facts of this case and those in Estex . Woolworths Corporation was not a foreign manufacturer of goods. It was not the owner of an Australian trade mark. It did not sell goods bearing the Colorado mark for delivery in Australia. What we have here is a local retailer which, through the agency of a related company, arranged for goods to be manufactured overseas bearing a mark nominated by the local retailer and then imported the goods for retail sale. The only involvement of Woolworths Corporation is that it authorised its local subsidiary to use one of its in-house marks. It no doubt permitted other subsidiaries to use those marks in other jurisdictions. However that may be, merely authorising a person to use a mark in Australia is not use in Australia by the person giving the authority. It is clear in my view that only Colorado Group used the mark in Australia."

Case10527,cited,Widgery v Tepper (1877) 6 Ch D 364,"Dr Wenkart placed reliance on the statement of James LJ, with whom Baggallay LJ agreed, in Widgery v Tepper (1877) 6 Ch D 364 at 369 that: ""The authorities are sufficient to shew that a charging order cannot be given except for an ascertained sum, and not for costs, charges, and expenses, until they have been taxed."" In Wilkie v Wilkie &amp; Anor [1905] VR 80 at 82 Hodges J accepted, on the authority of Widgery v Tepper , that an ex parte order made by him charging a sum of money paid into court as security for costs of an appeal could not stand because the costs had not yet been taxed. See also Fine Real Estate Network Pty Ltd v Howell (unreported, Young J, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 4 December 1997). 82 I do not consider that I am free to accept that the principle invoked by the Court of Appeal in Widgery v Tepper has application in the circumstances of this case to invalidate the charge purportedly granted by Dr Wenkart over the Paddington property. The orders of 11 March 2002 were made by consent (see [15] above). While the proper construction of order 2 of those orders may be open to argument, there is no doubt that Dr Wenkart agreed to charge the Paddington property in favour of Mr Pantzer to secure the amount of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer was or might become lawfully entitled. He did so to facilitate the consideration by his creditors of a proposal under s 73 of the Act. Having taken the benefit of the agreement reflected in the consent orders, Dr Wenkart is not free now (a) to disown order 2 because of the Full Court's determination of the true extent of Mr Pantzer's lawful entitlements or (b) to suggest that the order cannot be given any practical effect. Having regard to the reasons for judgment of the Full Court, I conclude that the charge effected by order 2 encompasses all amounts to which, during the life of the charge, Mr Pantzer is or becomes lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart."
Case13175,cited,Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1953] HCA 68 ; (1953) 89 CLR 428,"It was pointed out further by the Commissioner that '... even the minority judges in Dick Smith Electronics (Gleeson CJ and Callinan J) were prepared to accept that the promise to fund the dividend, as opposed to the performance of that promise, was a 'non-monetary consideration for the agreement to transfer on sale'. In that regard however Gleeson CJ and Callinan J observed (at 510) that while they were '... prepared to accept that the obligation accepted by [Dick Smith Electronics]', being the obligation of the purchaser to lend to that target company 'an amount sufficient to put it in funds to pay the dividend ', they decided nevertheless that '[w]e cannot accept that it is monetary consideration for the transfer on sale'. Be that as it may, the findings made by the High Court majority in Dick Smith Electronics were described by the Commissioner to be consistent with the approach taken in Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1953] HCA 68 ; (1953) 89 CLR 428, where it was held that the payment of amounts equal to 90 per cent of all rents, as and when received by lessees of a city mixed development, constituted in reality outgoings of a capital nature, being part of the capital costs for the acquisition of an asset comprising that development, and were therefore not deductible. In other words the terminology adopted by contracting parties in their contract does not necessarily determine the character of a transaction the subject of that contract at least for revenue purposes, irrespective of the nature and extent of the divergence of views between the majority and minority of the High Court in Dick Smith Electronics . So much may be readily accepted but the issue remains as to whether the Commissioner thereby gains the assistance it seeks from Dick Smith Electronics ."
Case12324,referred to,Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41,"Commonwealth submitted that no fiduciary duty could arise. There is, of course, no complete or comprehensive statement of what constitutes a fiduciary. However, where a novel fiduciary duty is alleged it is customary to refer to the judgment of Mason J in Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 96-97 which is in these terms: The accepted fiduciary relationships are sometimes referred to as relationships of trust and confidence or confidential relations (cf. Phipps v. Boardman [1966] UKHL 2 ; [1967] 2 A.C. 46 , at p. 127), viz., trustee and beneficiary, agent and principal, solicitor and client, employee and employer, director and company, and partners. The critical feature of these relationships is that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense. The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position. The expressions ""for"", ""on behalf of"", and ""in the interests of"" signify that the fiduciary acts in a ""representative"" character in the exercise of his responsibility, to adopt an expression used by the Court of Appeal."

Case17199,followed,"Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 , 163 FCR 207","In the statutory context of the present legislation, Madgwick J has focussed attention upon those considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 , 163 FCR 207. A member of the Australian Defence Force had there died in November 1994 as a result of heat stress sustained during an army training exercise. His Honour there observed: [120] Decisions under the cognate New South Wales Act refer to the following considerations among others: (i) the penalty must be such as to compel attention to occupational health and safety generally, to ensure that workers whilst at work will not be exposed to risks to their health and safety; (ii) it is a significant aggravating factor that the risk of injury was foreseeable even if the precise cause or circumstances of exposure to the risk were not foreseeable; (iii) the offence may be further aggravated if the risk of injury is not only foreseeable but actually foreseen and an adequate response to that risk is not taken by the employer; (iv) the gravity of the consequences of an accident does not of itself dictate the seriousness of the offence or the amount of penalty. However the occurrence of death or serious injury may manifest the degree of the seriousness of the relevant detriment to safety; (v) a systemic failure by an employer to appropriately address a known or foreseeable risk is likely to be viewed more seriously than a risk to which an employee was exposed because of a combination of inadvertence on the part of an employee and a momentary lapse of supervision; (vi) general deterrence and specific deterrence are particularly relevant factors in light of the objects and terms of the Act; (vii) employers are required to take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace. This implies constant vigilance. Employers must adopt an approach to safety which is proactive and not merely reactive. In view of the scope of those obligations, in most cases it will be necessary to have regard to the need to encourage a sufficient level of diligence by the employer in the future. This is particularly so where the employer conducts a large enterprise which involves inherent risks to safety; (viii) regard should be had to the levels of maximum penalty set by the legislature as indicative of the seriousness of the breach under consideration; (xi) the neglect of simple, well-known precautions to deal with an evident and great risk of injury, take a matter towards the worst case category; (x) the objective seriousness of the offence, without more may call for the imposition of a very substantial penalty to vindicate the social and industrial policies of the legislation and its regime of penalties. These considerations, it was concluded, "" provide [d] useful, analogical, general guidance as to the approach to be taken in consideration of penalties under the Commonwealth Act "". His Honour noted that the maximum penalty was 2,200 penalty units, a penalty of less than $250,000. The maximum penalty would be appropriate where there had been a "" conscious decision to flout the law "". A penalty of 1,800 penalty units ($198,000) was ordered. His Honour found that there had been "" systemic failures of the most serious kind "": at [125]. 37 These considerations may also be applied to the task of assessing the penalty to be imposed under the current legislation. To some extent the considerations set forth by Madgwick J overlap with those set forth by French J; to some extent they do not. 39 A final matter of principle should also be noted. It is inappropriate to fix a penalty simply by reference to the quantum of a penalty imposed in another case. It was thus understood to be common ground between the parties to the present proceeding that it was not appropriate to regard (in particular) the penalty of $198,000 in Comcare v Commonwealth as itself fixing a "" benchmark "" against which other penalties are to be determined in cases involving death. In NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 , Burchett and Kiefel JJ observed (at 295): A hallmark of justice is equality before the law, and, other things being equal, corporations guilty of similar contraventions should incur similar penalties: Trade Practices Commission v Axive Pty Ltd [(1994) ATPR 41-368] (at 42,795). There should not be such an inequality as would suggest that the treatment meted out has not been even-handed: cf the criminal law case Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46 ; (1984) 154 CLR 606. However, other things are rarely equal where contraventions of the Trade Practices Act are concerned. In the present case, differing circumstances, size, market power and responsibility for the contraventions, as well as other factors, complicate any attempt to compare the penalties imposed on the appellant with those imposed on the other corporations. Another form of comparison is not appropriate. The facts of the instant case should not be compared with a particular reported case in order to derive therefrom the amount of the penalty to be fixed. Cases are authorities for matters of principle; but the penalty found to be appropriate, as a matter of fact, in the circumstances of one case cannot dictate the appropriate penalty in the different circumstances of another case. The point was well made by Spender J in Trade Practices Commission v Annand and Thompson Pty Ltd [(1987) ATPR 40-772] (at 48,394) when he said: ""Each case must, of course, be viewed on its own facts and facts may be infinite in their variety."" It follows, as his Honour also said, that ""[t]he quantum of penalties imposed in other cases can seldom be of very much direct assistance"". A comparison of the facts in Comcare v Commonwealth and the facts in the present proceeding only serves to underline the point there being made by Burchett and Kiefell JJ (and by Spender J) -- namely that the facts and circumstances of individual cases are infinitely diverse. The quantum of any penalty to be imposed must necessarily be fixed by reference to the peculiar facts arising in each case as and when they arise. 40 In the present proceeding it is considered that an appropriate penalty is $165,000 -- that being the sum as agreed between the parties. 41 In imposing that penalty, consideration has been given to both: &#8226; the agreement as between the parties; and &#8226; the facts and circumstances as set forth in the Statement of Agreed Facts and such evidence as has been relied upon."

It is for this reason that s 5(4) is of such importance it has the effect of shifting the onus of proof to the employer with the result that the employer is obliged to prove a negative if he is to avoid being found guilty of the offence charged if all the other facts and circumstances constituting the offence are proved. The onus so cast upon the employer is to prove a negative on a preponderance of probabilities'."
Case8710,considered,Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513 ,"decision-making, of its nature, involves the formation of value judgments as to such matters as credibility, the strength or compellingness of the particular case, the importance of consistency in decision-making and the simple formation of the relevant opinion which the statute prescribes as the occasion for the exercise of the power. Thus, s 65 of the Act requires the Minister, as the decision-maker, to be satisfied of particular matters if she is to grant a visa. Value judgments are ones in respect of which there is room for reasonable differences of opinion, no particular opinion being uniquely right: cp Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 518 per Mason and Deane JJ; 540-541 per Brennan J; see too at 535 per Wilson and Dawson JJ. As Brennan J said, there is no difference in principle between the review of a judicial discretion and the review of an administrative discretion (161 CLR at 540). He pointed out that if a discretionary power were exercised in a way which a reasonable repository of the power might exercise it, that exercise of power is supported by the statute which conferred it, whether the discretion be judicial or administrative in nature. Brennan J went on to point out that appellate courts were more familiar with the usual confines within which judicial discretions might be exercised and were therefore more sensitive to an unreasonable exercise of such a discretion and more confident of their ability to detect error in its exercise. He said: 'It is harder to be satisfied that an administrative body has acted unreasonably, particularly when the administrative discretion is wide in its scope or is affected by policies of which the court has no experience.'

Case24709,cited,Sykes v Australian Electoral Commission [1993] HCA 36 ; (1993) 115 ALR 645,"relationship between these two requirements, however, involves some "" obscurity "". Dawson J in Sykes v Australian Electoral Commission [1993] HCA 36 ; (1993) 115 ALR 645 at 648 to 649 addressed the position as follows: It would seem that the facts which para (a) requires to be set out are the essential facts from which, if proved, it might be concluded that the election or return was invalid. Although the precise distinction between para (a) and para (aa) of s 355 is a matter of some obscurity, it appears that under para (a) the essential facts may be stated with a degree of generality and it is para (aa) which requires sufficient particularity to identify the specific matter or matters relied on. The dividing line between what is essential and what amounts merely to particularity may sometimes be difficult to draw. What is clear, however, is that the facts which para (a) requires to be set out must not only be the essential facts relied on but must also be sufficient to justify a finding of invalidity [references omitted]. That must be so for otherwise s 355(a) in conjunction with s 358(1) would achieve little. If it were not so, a petitioner might allege insufficient facts to justify relief under the Act but nevertheless contend that, as they were the only facts upon which he or she relied, the requirements of para (a) were satisfied. The court would then be required to try the petition even though on its face it could not succeed. Despite that "" obscurity "", it is "" clear from s 358(1) that no proceedings may be had on the petition unless it sets out the facts relied on to invalidate the election "": McClure v Australian Electoral Commission [1999] HCA 31 at [23] , [1999] HCA 31 ; 163 ALR 734 at 739 per Hayne J. But there is no power to relieve a petitioner of the requirements of s 355(a): Robertson v Australian Electoral Commission [1993] HCA 50 ; (1993) 116 ALR 407 at 409 per Toohey J. Nor is there any ability for the Petitioner to now seek to amend the petition to remedy his failure to comply with s 355(a). After the period nominated for the filing of the petition by s 355(e), there is thereafter no power to amend: Rudolphy v Lightfoot [1999] HCA 61 at [10] , [1999] HCA 61 ; 197 CLR 500 at 507. Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ there observed: [12] The provision with respect to the 40 day period plainly is designed to produce criteria which are objective and certain and reflect the public interest in resolving expeditiously and with finality questions respecting disputed elections and returns. Further, there is a body of authority which predates the 1989 Act and establishes that, once the 40 day period has expired, it is not possible thereafter to amend the petition which has been filed within time so as to cure any non-compliance with the requirement of s 355. The reasoning underlying those decisions is that to permit amendment would in effect permit evasion of the requirement that the petition in a final form be filed within the 40 day period. Those cases do not in terms specify the 40 day requirement as a jurisdictional requirement but ... that is how the matter should be understood. See also: Sykes v Australian Electoral Commission [1993] HCA 36 ; (1993) 115 ALR 645 at 648 to 649 per Dawson J; Hudson v Entsch [2005] FCA 300 at [4] per Dowsett J. If the essential facts necessary to the conclusion of invalidity of the election in question are not set out, no proceeding may be had upon the petition: Wheeley v The Australian Electoral Commissioner [2005] FCA 473 at [12] per Kiefel J. The primary submission of the Corporation and the Commission, it is considered, should prevail. As they correctly contend, two fundamental difficulties confronting the Petitioner are insurmountable, namely: (a) there is an absence of any statement of those facts necessary to establish any "" illegal practice ""; and, even assuming that such facts could be distilled from the petition; (b) there is an absence of any facts upon which the Court could be "" satisfied that the result of the election was likely to be affected "" within the meaning of s 362(3). Even such a rudimentary fact as the person who committed the "" illegal practice "" is left unidentified in the petition. Section 355(a) does not require that there be "" set out "" in the petition the particular provision of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which has been contravened; but it does require there to be "" set out "": those facts which identify who it was that published or caused to be published, permitted or authorised the publication of the webpage (s 328A(1)(a)(i) or (ii)); and those facts which might establish that the electoral advertisement was intended to affect the voting in an election (s 328A(1)(b)). None of those facts, or facts relevant to the other elements of s 328A , are "" set out "". During oral submissions, the Petitioner identified the person who it was said published the electoral advertisement as Mr Oakeshott &#8212; but the facts have to be in the petition and not oral submissions. And there is also an absence of any fact set forth in the petition upon which any view at all could be formed as to the effect of any such practice upon the election. Those facts must also be set forth in the petition: Smith v Australian Electoral Commission [2008] FCA 953 , 104 ALD 395. Bennett J there concluded: [15] Whether or not the requirements of s 355(a) are complied with is to be determined solely by reference to what appears on the face of the petition ( Wheeley v Australian Electoral Commission [2005] FCA 473 at [13] per Kiefel J). In the present case there are no facts set out or assertions made in the petition as to the likely outcome of the election other than the possibility that, because of a preference deal, the quota or a Senate position may have been achieved for some other, unspecified, group. The facts alleged emphasise the difficulty of ""unscrambling"" the Senate results if a group were to be removed. As Dawson J said in Sykes at 649, it is not sufficient for a petitioner to allege insufficient facts to justify relief under the Act but nevertheless contend that as they were the only facts upon which he or she relied, the requirements of paragraph (a) were satisfied. [16] I accept the Commission's submissions that the statutory threshold has not been established. The petition does not set out the essential facts relied on to invalidate the election as required by s 355(a). Nor is there any further evidence upon which the Court could now be "" satisfied that the result of the election was likely to be affected "" by the illegal practice to which the Petitioner refers. An Affidavit as filed on behalf of the Corporation establishes that the results of the election for the seat of Lyne were that the First Respondent, being the candidate who won the election , polled 47,306 votes (63.8% of the vote); the Petitioner polled 400 votes (0.54% of the vote)."
Case8524,cited,ANZ Executors &amp; Trustee Co Ltd v Qintex Australia Ltd (receiver and managers appointed) (1990) 8 ACLC 980,"Minister did not rely upon s 96.1 of the CATSI Act as providing the foundation for the Housing Associations incorporated under it to be enabled to enter into the proposed subleases. That may be simply because there are only three of them, and the condition precedent to the activation of each proposed sublease in clause 2.1(a)(i) referred to above would not be satisfied. It may also be because, notwithstanding its apparent effect, there is some authority to suggest its role is confined to validating corporate dealings with outsiders despite deficiencies in corporate capacity, but not to abrogating restrictions on the exercise of shareholders' or directors' powers: see eg per McPherson J (with whom Lee and McKenzie JJ agreed) in ANZ Executors &amp; Trustee Co Ltd v Qintex Australia Ltd (receiver and managers appointed) (1990) 8 ACLC 980 at 988. There may be other reasons. It may be that such a provision does not inhibit a member of such an association from asserting that the common understanding of the members and their general intention was for the association to control the use and development of those town camps, and seeking to enforce that position. That sort of contention has been used to support the winding up of a corporation or the just and equitable ground: see Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13 th ed, 2007, Butterworths) at [12.130] p 744 and the cases there cited. As the issue was not raised, it is not necessary to go beyond those comments. Consequently, it is necessary to consider the second of the questions I have identified above. That is, it is necessary to determine whether the particular terms of the proposed subleases mean that the agreement to enter into them is contrary to the interests of the members as a whole. The Residents as members put their contention quite brutally: for $1, the Housing Associations have given up all rights, functions and representative activities in relation to their town camps so they cannot discharge their responsibilities to their members under Item 1.3 of their Constitutions and under their Rule Books. There is ""an equation of $1 for no rights for at least 40 years""."

Case9268,discussed,Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Cooper [2005] FCA 1878,
Case3823,applied,D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397,"The question whether leave to appeal should be granted falls to be determined according to the criteria set down by the Full Court in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397. First, whether the impugned decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration. Secondly, whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted, supposing that the impugned decision was wrong. 21 The applicant, by his submissions, contends that: ""9. ... The proposition that [the second respondent] and/or Mr Ariss could have been expected to contend for, if present before the [Federal Magistrates] Court, namely, that they or one of them was the true owner of the jewellery, was clearly articulated as was the basis upon which they might seek to rely to establish such a claim: (a) there was express disclosure that [the second respondent] and Mr Ariss were persons named as insureds in relation to the jewellery; (b) there was express disclosure that the bankrupt gave evidence that when she asked her husband (ie, Mr Ariss) for the jewellery, he said the jewellery was the property of [the second respondent] and that she could not have it; (c) there was express disclosure that when the husband had been examined pursuant to s81 of the Bankruptcy Act , he asserted that he had given certain items of the jewellery to one or both of this daughters, consistent with ownership of the jewellery by him or [the second respondent]; (d) there was express disclosure that the bankrupt expressed the opinion that some of the house contents, the subject of the same policy of insurance, might be owned by [the second respondent] although, like the jewellery, such items of contents were not disclosed as an asset in the balance sheet of [the second respondent]. 10. In order to determine whether or not there was 'material' non-disclosure, it is necessary to have regard to the evidence of the bankrupt as a whole. It is asserted that the fact she had earlier given evidence contrary to the proposition the jewellery was hers was not disclosed. What the transcript of the evidence given by the bankrupt on 22 December 2005 discloses is that she did on occasion give contrary evidence. That is, on occasion she gave evidence that she thought that the jewellery was either that of Mr Ariss or [the second respondent]. However, what is critical is that she was examined as to why she might hold to that view. She said in evidence that she held that view for two reasons, namely: (a) because those persons were named as insureds in relation to the jewellery; and (b) her husband had told her that the jewellery was the property of [the second respondent] or of himself. Both considerations which had led [the bankrupt] to on occasion state that the jewellery might be the property of [the second respondent] or of Mr Ariss were disclosed on the ex parte application, as was the fact there was evidence consistent with such potential claims. 11. The cases establish that, on an application made ex parte, there must be disclosure of material facts. The material facts which were required to be disclosed here were: (a) that [the second respondent] and Mr Ariss were persons who were named as persons having an insured interest in relation to the jewellery. This was disclosed in the King ... affidavit and the relevant insurance documents were exhibited; (b) that Mr Ariss, currently the sole director of [the second respondent], held the view that the jewellery in question was either his or [the second respondent's]. This was also disclosed. 12. The best evidence that Mr Ariss and/or [the second respondent] would claim to be the owners of the jewellery, and the basis of that claim, was before the Federal Magistrates Court. There was direct evidence, of which the Court was informed, that Mr Ariss asserted the jewellery was his or [the second respondent's] and, on that basis, refused to return it to his wife. In those circumstances, the fact there was additional evidence from the bankrupt that, on the basis of the insureds' interest and on the basis of what her husband told her, she believed that the jewellery may be his or [the second respondent's] jewellery, was not material. ... ... 17. The King ... affidavit disclosed that [the second respondent] or Mr Ariss would assert an entitlement to the jewellery. The ... Magistrate knew that was the case they would make and knew there was documentary evidence in support of that case, at least as to an arguable insurable interest, notwithstanding none of the jewellery appeared on the balance sheet of [the second respondent]."" 28 The Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration. I do not think it necessary to go on to consider whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted, supposing that the Magistrate's decision was wrong. The two limbs of the test in D&eacute;cor Corporation cannot be considered in isolation from one another: see D&eacute;cor Corporation at 398-399. The prospect that an appeal, if leave were granted, would be successful is so remote that it would be artificial to suppose that the decision below is wrong.

Case398,cited,Lake v Bayliss [1974] 2 All ER 1114,"The following summary account of general principles is in accord with his Lordship's affidavit. (1) The English legislation that made a ""debt or other legal thing in action"" assignable in law was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) and the provision is now found in s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). (2) Although the common law did not recognise assignments of legal choses in action, equitable assignments of them were recognised. Lord Millett states that ""[e]quitable assignments of legal choses in action are of great antiquity"". I note that in his recent scholarly work, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006), Dr Tolhurst states (at [2.16]): By the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was settled that equity would recognise the assignment of a legal chose in action and viewed the common law's position as ""absurd"" [ Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 340 (100 ER 1042 at 1053) per Buller J]. (3) The statutory provision did not impair the efficacy of equitable assignments, and neither the equitable assignment nor notice of it to the debtor (if notice of it was given) was required to be expressed in any particular manner, and might be written or oral in form, so long as the intention to assign and (if notice of it was given) the intention to give notice of an assignment were plain: William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Company Limited [1905] AC 454 at 462 per Lord Macnaghten. (4) Notice to the debtor was not a requirement of a valid equitable assignment, as it is in the case of a valid legal assignment under the statutory provision: Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128; Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 at 392. As between assignor and assignee, an equitable assignment is complete and binding from the time when it is made or when the assignor has agreed, for valuable consideration, to make it. (5) The debtor's state of mind is irrelevant. However, the debtor's liability will be discharged if it pays the assignor before receiving notice of the assignment. In such a case, the assignor will hold the amount paid to it upon trust for the assignee. (6) Notice to the debtor need not be in any particular form and may be given by any party. Lord Millett states: ""The question is whether the debtor has notice of the assignment or has been put on enquiry whether there has been an assignment. If he goes ahead without enquiry and pays the assignor, he is at risk of having to pay twice."" (7) Because a debt cannot be sold in a ready market elsewhere, a contract to assign a debt is, subject to impediments that may exist, specifically enforceable in equity. Accordingly, an equitable assignment need not purport to be an actual present assignment, and may take the form of a contract, for valuable consideration, to assign: see Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510 at 520 521; In Re Warren; ex parte Wheeler v The Trustee in Bankruptcy [1938] Ch 725 at 734 6; and see Tolhurst, op cit at [7.16]. (8) Whether or not it is correct to say that the assignor holds the legal chose in action on trust for the assignee before the promised consideration is paid, once the promised consideration is paid, it does. It will then hold the benefit of the obligor's undertaking upon a constructive trust for the assignee, even if specific performance of the contract to assign between assignor and assignee could not have been obtained by the assignee previously. As Lord Millett summarises the position, ""[t]he trust ceases to be defeasible or contingent; the vendor becomes a fiduciary; and the purchaser has all the remedies of a beneficiary under an ordinary trust"", citing Rose v Watson (1864) 10 HLCas 672 (11 ER 1187) esp per Lord Cranworth at 683 4 (ER 1192), and see also Lake v Bayliss [1974] 2 All ER 1114."
Case17389,cited,Hayes Knight GTO Pty Limited v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2005] FCA 1509 ; (2005) 147 FCR 468,"of the imminence of the case it is best that I form and express a view as to this particular discovery application promptly. I will do so without reserving my decision. The power to order discovery in judicial review proceedings is clear. Over the years there has been a plethora of authority dealing with the circumstances under which it ought to be granted. Beyond saying that there is a certain restraint to be observed, in my opinion it is not necessary to encrust a judicial discretion to be exercised as a matter of practice and procedure with all sorts of judge-made rules. Some of the more modern authorities were referred to recently by Siopis J in Hayes Knight GTO Pty Limited v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2005] FCA 1509 ; (2005) 147 FCR 468 and the comprehensive submissions of the parties have identified a number of other relevant authorities. The issue needs to be focused upon the basis for the judicial review application. In the present case, there are several broad grounds of attack. The first is the natural justice ground and it is said that there should be discovery related to cl 1(a) of the grounds of application. With all respect, I fail to see any basis for discovery in relation to the failure to afford natural justice as alleged. The relevant facts are clear and are within the knowledge of the applicants. The next broad ground is that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) failed to take relevant considerations into account. That involves three steps. One is the existence of the consideration; secondly, is the relevance of the consideration; and, thirdly, there is the failure to take it into account. The disclosure or discovery of the documents which I have indicated I will order should make clear those circumstances or considerations which were not taken into account or, at least, will do all that can be done to establish that proposition. It is tempting to leave any other aspect of the matter until after consideration has been given to those documents. However, it seems to me that when I go through the individual paragraphs which are relied upon, there is no proper basis for discovery on this issue at this point because of two fundamental factors. The first is that the applicants were the subject of the investigation in question and much of what is alleged is within their own personal knowledge. Secondly, they received communications from ASIC which would establish many of the factual matters, in particular, the letter to which attention was drawn yesterday which was exhibit LMS17 dated 23 February 2004. That has been added to this morning by ASIC indicating a number of facts which it is prepared to admit for the purposes of the proceedings. It may be doubtful whether those admissions carry the letter any further, but they certainly do give formality to that situation. I will run through the relevant paragraphs of the application. The first is the fact of ASIC's lengthy prior investigation into the conduct of the deed administrators and the affairs of the company. That seems to me to be clearly within the knowledge of the applicants supplemented by the communications from ASIC. The second is the examination of, amongst others, one of the deed administrators, and the mine manager in connection with that investigation. That again is a matter of which evidence has been given. The third is the fact that ASIC was assisted during its investigations and those examinations by, and reached its conclusions having regard to, both expert accounting evidence and independent legal advice from senior counsel. The source of that is the ASIC communication. The point has been made today that the content of the expert accounting advice and, in particular, the independent legal advice, may be relevant to the case. I do not prejudge that at the moment, but that has not been alleged in terms. It seems to me that if it is desired to persist in an application to inspect that material, then a particular application should be made for that purpose. The fourth, the fact that at the conclusion of the investigation and those examinations ASIC reached the view that the prospects of success were insufficient to justify ASIC commencing litigation against the deed administrator, is again established by the letter and admissions. The fifth, the fact of the dislocation, disruption, and expense already experienced and incurred, etc, is a matter within the knowledge of the applicants. To the extent that particulars 9, 10 and 11 are pressed, it seems to me that they are not matters which call for discovery."
Case22481,referred to,Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 222 CLR 115,"The process of reasoning of the AAT is transparent. It made a factual decision on this aspect of the claim in the light of all the evidence. It has identified in its reasons the evidence upon which it made that decision. True it is that the AAT has not then minutely dissected that evidence to explain which particular parts of it attracted its general factual conclusions. But it has made findings on the material questions of fact (see per McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407), and its reasons for those findings are exposed sufficiently to enable the Court (and the parties) to understand how it reached those findings and so to discern if they were reached through legal error (see Commonwealth of Australia v Smith (1989) 18 ALD 224; Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 222 CLR 115). In my view, no error of law by failing to comply with s 43 of the AAT Act has been made out in respect of the decision of the AAT concerning the invalidity service pension claim; see generally Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647."
Case3737,cited,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"The applicant concedes, ""The Respondent's reasons cannot be construed as if they were as statute, or with an eye finely attuned for error."" This statement adopts the thrust of the observations of the Full Court in Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic (1993) 43 FCR 280, including the mis-combination of visual and aural senses. Of these observations, the joint judgment in the High Court of Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 said: These propositions are well settled. They recognise the reality that the reasons of an administrative decision-maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed. In the present context, any court reviewing a decision upon refugee status must beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision. This has been made clear many times in this Court. For example, it was said by Brennan J in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin : [(1990) [1990] HCA 21 ; 170 CLR 1 at 35-36.] The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository's power. If, in so doing, the court avoids administrative injustice or error, so be it; but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error. The merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone."

Case1076,approved,Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608,"notion of a 'market in Australia' was recently referred to by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976 , where his Honour stated (at [33]-[34]): Although the notion of a ""market in Australia"" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. In Riverstone , Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a ""market in Australia"" a market must be wholly within Australia. His Honour said (at [21]) that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. As the Commission points out, a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act, especially in the modern telecommunications era. In my opinion, Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608 was correct in concluding that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products (or services). However, I do not take the reference by Hill J to a global market which includes Australia as arguably a market in Australia 'if sales are made [in Australia]' ([2002] FCA 1608 at [22] ) as making it a requirement that the contract under which services are supplied in Australia must be entered into in Australia or that the transactions themselves must be entered into in Australia. In my view, Hill J was simply proffering an example of how one might identify the possible location of competition, and was not providing a definitive statement that buyers and sellers of services must enter into transactions in Australia."

The applicant applied in the High Court for orders to show cause why writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus should not issue, although he did not include a claim for mandamus in his amended application filed on 4 August 2008. The High Court Rules 2004 relevantly limit the time for making application for certiorari and mandamus.

His Honour observed that unless the rules of pleading permit a degree of flexibility, serious inroads would be made into the utility of the representative procedure. 41 However, it is clear from what Sackville J said that the level of generality which may be permitted in pleadings in representative actions is concerned with the pleading of facts material to the claims of each member of the represented group: see Philip Morris at [134], [136], cf.

Case682,followed,Sleiman and Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] AATA 1383,"Tribunal saw the issue between the parties as being whether there was a statutory provision to the contrary of the view that effective exercise of the Tribunal's review power normally required it to be free to consider the application of any of the criteria on which the proper exercise of the statutory power might depend: the Tribunal cited Sleiman and Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] AATA 1383 ( Sleiman ) at [9]. Sleiman was also concerned with an application by ASIC to the CALDB in relation to a registered liquidator. In that case, as in the present one, s 1317B of the Law (s 1317B of the Act is in the same terms) permitted an application to be made to the Tribunal for review of a decision made under the Act by the Board. The Tribunal found nothing in s 1292 or s 1317B to alter the ordinary position as recognised in that line of cases, and referred with approval to Senior Member Taylor's statement in Sleiman at [10] that: ... it is likely to be appropriate, subject to being satisfied that Mr Sleiman has a proper opportunity to deal with them, and subject to any order that might be made under s 25(4A) of the AAT Act, for ASIC to seek to support the cancellation order against Mr Sleiman on the additional grounds contained in its amended Statement of Facts and Contentions. Consideration of Tribunals' decision of 2 November 2007 not to preclude ASIC from relying on Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A Question 23 Question 23 raises the question whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear and determine Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A.

Case15976,considered,ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248,"this regard, the EPBC Act is not unique. It is an analogue of s 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 . Observations made by the members of the Full Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 are pertinent. Materially, in that case, the following observations, presently pertinent by analogy, were made in relation to the framing of injunctive relief: Mr Justice Lockhart, French J agreeing, stated, at 259-260: Plainly injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether or not their future conduct falls within the scope or boundaries of the injunction. Contempt proceedings are not appropriate for the determination of questions of construction of the injunction or the aptness of the language in which they are framed: see Trade Practices Commission v Walplan Pty Limited [1985] FCA 389 ; (1985) 7 FCR 495 ; Trade Practices Commission v Glo Juice Pty Limited (1987) 73 ALR 407 at 412-414; and Commodore Business Machines Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 92 ALR 563. Decisions under the Act have applied these principles and the judgments refer to the dangers of orders being cast in broad terms which ""train the heavy guns of the law upon the respondent"" ( Glo Juice at 418) without giving him adequate guidance. As Toohey J. observed in Maclean v Shell Chemical (Australia) Pty Limited (1984) 2 FCR 593 (at 599): ""Any injunction granted should be in such terms that is reasonably capable of being obeyed. ... (The order sought) would create uncertainty and place the respondent in a position where it would not know with any precision what was required of it. It follows that, faced with an application to enforce such an injunction, the court would be in an equally difficult position."" See also Trade Practices Commission v Walplan Pty Limited . In Commodore a Full Court of this Court said at 574: ""The injunction sought in the application was in the following terms: 'An injunction restraining (Commodore) from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance in respect of the supply of Amiga computers (as defined in the statement of claim) supplied by ( Commodore ).' An injunction in that form might be suggested by the relief granted by the Commonwealth Industrial Court in Festival Stores v Mikasa (NSW) Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 69 ; (1971) 18 FLR 260. On appeal, reported [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617 at 631-2, Barwick C.J. rejected an attack on the propriety of an order which enjoined a wholesaler 'from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance in respect of tableware marketed ... under the trade name 'Mikasa'.' Nevertheless, such an injunction as that sought by the Commission in this case would have been open to the objection that it was of an undesirable width because, in respect of the supply of Amiga computers, it did no more than reproduce, but this time with the risk of sanctions for contempt, that which the Act in terms forbade by s 48. Any practice of awarding injunctions in such a form is to be discouraged. Such injunctions conflict with the general precept, applicable to the exercise of power under s 80 of the Act as much as to the framing of injunctions in aid of legal and equitable rights, that a final injunction should bear upon the case alleged and proved against the defendant, and should indicate that conduct which is enjoined or commanded to be performed, so that the defendant knows what is expected of him as a matter of fact. Further, where the injunction is in the form of an interlocutory order, it is undesirable to frame the injunction in such a way as to leave the issues in the case open for determination on a contempt proceeding, rather than at a final hearing: see generally Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union [1984] FCA 202 ; (1984) 3 FCR 55 at 65-6; 54 ALR 730 (Full Court); Trade Practices Commission v Glo Juice Co Pty Ltd (1987) 73 ALR 407 at 412-16 (Burchett J) and Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1987) 75 ALR 331 at 347 (Pincus J)."" The drafting of injunctions is ultimately a practical question. In some cases it presents no difficulties to the draftsman, but in others the exercise is far from easy. Mr Justice Gummow made the following observations (at 266-267): In Mr Heydon's work ""Trade Practices Law"" para. 18.740, the view is expressed that whilst in concept the statutory remedy provided for in s. 80 of the Act is different from the equitable remedy of injunction as administered in the inherent jurisdiction of courts of equity, nevertheless ""in many practical respects it is not, however, fundamentally distinct from the equitable remedy."" I agree with that observation. ... Sub-section 80(1) confers upon the Court the power to grant an injunction where it is satisfied that a person has engaged or is proposing to engage in conduct that constitutes or would constitute conduct of the description in paras. (a)-(f). The power of the Court to grant an injunction is controlled by the words ""in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate."" Thus, the terms of the injunction will not be ""appropriate"" if, on its face, it operates upon a range of conduct some of which does, but some of which does not, have the relationship required by s. 80 with contravention of the Act. The injunction should not prohibit conduct falling outside the boundaries drawn by s. 80: Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 161. The same limitation applies to mandatory injunctive relief. It is, in my view, no support for the grant of an injunction which, from the outset, has an operation outside the boundaries of s. 80, to say that it is open for the party enjoined to apply under sub-s. 80(3) to vary the injunction so as to bring its operation wholly within proper limits. The party in question should not be placed under any such obligation in the first place. In the course of his expressing agreement with the judgement of Lockhart J, French J observed (at 268) of the power to grant injunctive relief conferred by s 80 of the Trade Practices Act , ""The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act."" Attention needs to be given to the language of s 475 when considering both the nature of the power conferred and the remedy which may appropriately be granted pursuant to that power. In context, if a failure to do an act namely, the construction of a dam incorporating an installed fish transfer device suitable for lungfish constitutes an offence or other contravention of the EPBC Act because the dam as constructed does not have installed such a fish transfer device, thereby breaching a condition of the approval for the taking of that act, the Court may grant an injunction requiring the person to do the act, ie to incorporate in the dam a fish transfer device suitable for lungfish. There is no evidence that Burnett Water challenged condition 3 of the Minister's approval on the basis that it was manifestly unreasonable because it required the performance of a task that was impossible or was cast in terms that were so uncertain as to be devoid of sensible meaning. Indeed, had the installation of such a device been impossible, that may, given the objects of the EPBC Act and the protection afforded to the lungfish, have called into question whether the Minister should have approved the construction of the dam at all. The relief sought by the Conservation Council in para 2 of the application is cast in more precise terms than the terms of condition 3 of the Ministerial approval. It is enough at present that the relief sought bears a reasonably arguable relationship with that which the statute permits the Court to grant and the circumstances of the case. In my opinion, it does. The claim for this relief is neither frivolous nor vexatious nor an abuse of process either for the purposes of O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules or for the purposes of s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The proposed relief certainly does more than just recite the terms of the statute. It is more precise than that which in the circumstances of ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission was regarded as appropriate. Whether it is appropriate to grant relief in terms of para 2 of the application, other terms (and that further or other relief was sought was foreshadowed in oral submissions by the Conservation Council) or at all depends on the proof of a contravention, on the construction of condition 3 and on the evidence led at trial. Given that para 2 does not warrant being summarily struck out, it is not appropriate to consider the issues mentioned in the preceding sentence either in the abstract or as a separate question divorced from the evidence at the trial. Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd and ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission are not cases which compel the summary striking out of para 2 of the application. If the Conservation Council proves those preconditions, a judicial discretion is enlivened. Considerations such as those set out in Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd are, in a non-exhaustive way, relevant to the formulation of injunctive relief in the exercise of that discretion. ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission establishes that injunctive relief granted under a power akin to s 475 of the EPBC Act must bear a relationship with the case alleged and proved and must be cast in terms which admit of an understanding of what is expected of the party enjoined. It does not follow from this that the Conservation Council is obliged to give particulars of what is a suitable fish transfer device for lungfish. It may, if it chooses, lead evidence touching on that subject as part of its case as to why the existing, installed device is unsuitable. If so, that evidence, together with other evidence led at the trial, may well inform how any injunctive relief ought to be cast."
Case22663,discussed,Western Australian Capital Investment Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 87 ALR 183,"The taxpayer was held entitled to particulars in Western Australian Capital Investment Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 87 ALR 183 ("" WA Capital ""). The Commissioner had issued notices under the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982 (Cth) (""the TUCTA Act ""). Subsection s 18(1) of the TUCTA Act governed the giving of such a notice. The relevant condition which enlivened the Commissioner's power to give a notice was that the Commissioner was of the opinion that vendor's recoupment tax was likely to become payable by a person or persons in relation to ordinary company tax or undistributed profits tax, as the case may be. The taxpayer asserted, and the Commissioner denied, that the Commissioner did not, prior to the issue of the notice, address his mind to this matter. The taxpayer said that the inference that he did not do so was to be drawn from the Commissioner's letter that accompanied the notice, which did not refer to the Commissioner's being of the opinion that vendor's recoupment tax was likely to become payable. 108 The case can be classified as a state of mind case, albeit one in which the legislation did not operate to create a liability immediately upon the existence of the specified state of mind. Rather the existence of the state of mind was expressed as the condition which enlivened the Commissioner's power to give the notice. 109 The taxpayer sought particulars as to the making of the opinion, such as who made it, what facts he or she took into account, whether the facts of opinion were recorded in writing, and the authority of the person who formed the opinion."
Case11454,cited,Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389,"In addition, I can be more comfortable in drawing an inference that the solicitors had actual authority by the failure of the Hume companies to call evidence. I am entitled to infer that the testimony would not have been favourable to Hume's case; Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 at 418 419 (Handley JA). 47 The only other submission which I need to address under this subheading is not concerned with the question of authority. It is whether the email of 22 December 2006, attaching a copy of the letter of the same date, constituted written notice. 48 Counsel for Hume submitted it did not because an email is an electronic representation of writing and therefore does not constitute writing itself as required by Article 20(3).

Case7980,applied,SBBS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2002) 194 ALR 749,"The circumstances in which a court will find that an administrative decision-maker has not acted in good faith are rare ( SBBS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2002) 194 ALR 749 at [44]). Bad faith must be clearly alleged and proved ( SBBS at [43]). There is nothing on the face of the Tribunal's reasons that gives rise to a suggestion that the Tribunal was biased or to a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Tribunal. The Tribunal gave detailed and considered reasons for its rejection of the appellant's claim. The mere making of findings adverse to the appellant does not indicate bias or apprehended bias. Even if the appellant could establish error or irrationality on the part of the Tribunal, mere error or irrationality does not demonstrate a lack of good faith ( SBBS at [45]). 37 I have rejected grounds one to three above on which the appellant relies to establish bias but, even considered cumulatively, they do not demonstrate actual or apprehended bias. The appellant submits that the Tribunal engaged in ""nit picking"". Questioning the appellant or expressing concern about facts and claims that may be said to be of minor overall importance does not demonstrate a closed mind and does not amount to apprehended bias. 38 This ground of appeal does not succeed."

Case14478,cited,Direct Acceptance Corporation Ltd (1987) 5 ACLC 1037,"In the course of considering an entitlement asserted by a member or a member's proxy as to particular subject matter giving rise to a ruling, facts may need to be considered by the chair. Those facts may be relevant matters known by the chair by reason of circumstances surrounding the calling of a meeting or facts learnt in the course of the meeting or a combination of fact-finding circumstances. Some such facts, in another context, have been described as 'emergent questions, questions of fact that have to be decided then and there' ( McLean Bros. &amp; Rigg Ltd v Grice [1906] HCA 1 ; (1906) 4 CLR 835 at 860 per Barton J). A chair engaged in the conduct of a meeting is not in a position to undertake a 'voir dire' as to emergent factual contentions. He or she must hear the contentions of fact going to the question and decide the immediate question. A chair is not required to act judicially in deciding these questions before him or her. The chair is required to act 'bona fide' ( Corpique (No. 20) v Eastcourt (1989) 15 ACLR 586 at 596 per Cohen J) or at least in a way that is not 'neglectful' ( Corpique , per Cohen J at 596). On a question of whether the chair of a meeting of relevant members of a corporation, convened to consider a scheme of arrangement, had given members sufficient opportunity to debate the merits of the scheme, McLelland J, in Direct Acceptance Corporation Ltd (1987) 5 ACLC 1037 at 1041, said, 'However, on such a matter as this, the chairman as a matter of law has a wide discretion with which the court will not interfere unless the exercise of that discretion can be shown to be invalid, e.g. on the ground that it was exercised in bad faith' . In Fast Scout Ltd v Bergel &amp; Ors (2001) 40 ACSR 376 , Templeman J considered, in the context of a ruling relating to the validity of proxies, that 'generally, a chairman's decision will be amenable to review by the court if he makes an error of law' . Assuming the chair has exercised the jurisdiction conferred upon him by the meeting and the relevant instruments in good faith, the notion that his or her decision will be amenable to review on a ground of error of law although supported by established authority is more recently supported by a decision of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in Link Agricultural Pty Ltd v Shanahan &amp; Ors [1998] VSCA 3 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 498. Kenny JA with whom Batt JA and Buchanan J agreed, accepted that the powers exercisable by the chair are not unfettered and 'broadly speaking' the powers could not be exercised 'unlawfully' to deprive members of their votes (Kenny JA at 511). The decision taken by the chair to refuse Shanahan extra time to lodge his 'proxy holder card' after a particular deadline with the result that proxy voters lost the benefit of their right to vote, failed a test of legality [my term] because the chair's decision was not taken for the purpose of the power conferred by the Act (Kenny JA at pp 512 and 513). Kenny JA put the test in these terms, 'Whether or not there was error in the chairman's ruling depends on whether it was made in good faith and for [the] purpose. The ruling will be invalid if made in bad faith or for an ulterior or impermissible purpose' (Kenny JA at p 511). In Perera v Reilly (2006) 59 ACSR 317 , Murray J considered the intersection between s 253G of the Act and the approach to supervisory review of decisions of a chair of the meeting and said this: [45] The provision is designed to facilitate the despatch of corporate business by decisions taken at meetings. In that context, it has often been held that such a provision will operate as a privative provision, rendering the decision not amenable to judicial review if the power is exercised bona fide, albeit mistakenly ... at least in cases where there has been no error of law."
Case9322,cited,Royal Australian College of Surgeons v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1943] HCA 34 ; (1943) 68 CLR 436,"The general nature of the inquiries to be undertaken in ascertaining whether an entity is a charitable institution was discussed by Allsop J in Word Investments Ltd 164 FCR 194. His Honour referred to Royal Australian College of Surgeons v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1943] HCA 34 ; (1943) 68 CLR 436 and the analysis of the judgments in that case by Lockhart J in Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 23 FCR 82 at 90-93. These authorities demonstrated that the question as to the true nature or character of the entity is to be assessed having regard to its objects, purposes and activities (at [11]). Allsop J formulated the task of characterisation thus (at [14]): The relevant task, as stated in the Surgeons' Case is to assess the true character or nature of the entity by reference to its objects, purposes and activities. It is an integrated, holistic enquiry directed to whether a body of facts and circumstances satisfies a legal category or conception. 133 For an association to be characterised as a charitable institution it must exist for a public benefit as distinct from the creation of private benefits. The fourth class of charitable trust in Pemsel [1891] AC 531 brings in the public benefit requirement through the words ""beneficial to the community"". As Kenny J said in The Triton Foundation 147 FCR at [22]: The public may, however, include a section of the public. An association may have a public benefit purpose although some of its subsidiary or ancillary functions may benefit particular persons such as members of a profession: Royal Australian College of Surgeons v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1943] HCA 34 ; (1943) 68 CLR 436 at 447 and other authorities cited in The Triton Foundation 147 FCR at [23]."

It instanced Ryan v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2007) 158 FCR 301 at 317-323 [53]-[72] per Gyles J. The decision under challenge in that case, however, was a decision by ASIC to confer ""eligible applicant"" status on a person.

Gyles J ultimately held (at 321 [67]): In my opinion, the initiation of the exercise of a statutory power of an investigatory nature will not normally ""destroy, defeat or prejudice"" (to use the words from Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; 170 CLR 596) or ""imperil"" (to use Meagher J's word) any relevant right or interest such as to require notice to be given to the object prior to exercise of the power. In any event, where, as here, the exercise of a power is anterior to that which has a direct effect upon the party, there is no such requirement."
Case19869,cited,Lunney v Commissioner of Taxation [1958] HCA 5 ; (1958) 100 CLR 478,"There is a large body of authority to the effect that where borrowed money is laid out for the purposes of gaining assessable income this ""furnishes the required connection between the interest paid upon it by the taxpayer and the income derived by [it] from its use"": Ure v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1981) 81 ATC 4100 at 4104; see generally Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro [1926] HCA 58 ; (1926) 38 CLR 153 at 170-171; Hart v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCAFC 222 ; (2002) 121 FCR 206 at [26] - [27] ; reversed by the High Court but not on this point: see [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216. The interest paid is thus ""incidental and relevant"" to the gaining of that income for the purposes of s 51(1) and s 8-1: Ronpibon Tin NL and Tongkah Compound NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 56. I would note in passing that the ""incidental and relevant"" formula is commonly used to describe the necessary connection between the loss or outgoing incurred and the gaining or producing of assessable income, though it has been acknowledged that the formula does not constitute ""an exclusive or exhaustive test"" of the scope of s 51(1) requirement: Lunney v Commissioner of Taxation [1958] HCA 5 ; (1958) 100 CLR 478 at 497. Importantly, for present purposes, as was said by Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ in Commissioner of Taxation v Smith [1981] HCA 10 ; (1981) 147 CLR 578 at 586: ""What is incidental and relevant ... falls to be determined not by reference to the certainty or likelihood of the outgoing resulting in the generation of income but to its nature and character, and generally to its connection with the operations which more directly gain or produce the assessable income."""
Case8964,cited,Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90,"applicants' counsel told the Court that nowhere in the statements of issues and contentions of any of the parties is there a reference to either the Act or the section in question. There is no doubt that a Notice to Produce may be set aside if the documents sought by it lack apparent relevance to the proceeding: Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 102-103; Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] . In this case, the documents sought have been discovered and so are prima facie relevant. Other than the assertion from the bar table that the Act and section in question are not to be found in the statements of issues and contentions, no attempt has been made by the applicants to demonstrate that the documents are not relevant. That assertion is at any rate of limited assistance: the proceeding is still at an interlocutory stage and submissions on the substantive issues between the parties are yet to be made. The tentative submission of the applicants that document 1434 is not relevant is insufficient to displace the document's prima facie relevance."

Case17484,cited,"Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1008","submission appears to be inconsistent with the observations made in Bowling as explained in Ansett . The applicants also rely upon the decision of the Full Court in Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 at [107] , that of Merkel J in Ansett at [63] and that of Wilcox J in Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal and Clerical Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 184 ALR 641 at [72] - [73] , citing his Honour's earlier remarks in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1008. I suspect that the applicants have misunderstood these cases. The proposition identified at [107] in Davids related to the purpose of the former Act as a whole and, in particular, Part XA. It was not concerned with the distinction between status as a member, office holder or delegate, on the one hand, and actions in advancing the industrial interests of the union, on the other. Further, I note that the quotation of the relevant extract in the applicants' opening outline is inaccurate in one respect. In the report the relevant extract is as follows: In the context of the Act, Part XA does not stand alone. It is aimed at ensuring that employees may band together, if they wish, for collective bargaining of the type provided for in the Act to achieve the broader objectives of the Act as contained in s 3. ... That which is protected by such legislation is more than the right to be a member. It is the right to participate in protected union activities, including the taking of collective industrial action against an employer to seek to obtain better industrial conditions ... . This proposition, too, was concerned with the overall effect of the sections and not with the areas of operation of the individual paragraphs of s 298K, the predecessor of s 793(1). Similar comments apply to the extract from the judgment of Wilcox J in BHP Steel to which his Honour referred in Greater Dandenong . In Finance Sector Union of Australia v Australian &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited (2002) 114 IR 352 , Wilcox J applied the decision in Bowling as I have explained it. See that decision at [173] and [187]. See also the decision of Branson J in The Community and Public Sector Union v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1397 at [114] ."
Case388,discussed,Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) v Stevenson [1937] HCA 72 ; (1937) 59 CLR 80,"In Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) v Stevenson [1937] HCA 72 ; (1937) 59 CLR 80 ( Stevenson ), Evatt J stated in relation to s 11(b) of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1928 (NSW), which referred to ""dividends ... credited, paid, or distributed to the member or shareholder"", that the words ""credited"", ""paid"" and ""distributed"" were concerned with the manner in which a shareholder ""receives the benefit of the dividend"" (at 108). 170 I acknowledge that Jolly [1933] HCA 63 ; 50 CLR 131 and Stevenson [1937] HCA 72 ; 59 CLR 80 concerned more than simply the word ""paid"", and that Jolly involved the discharge of indebtedness of the shareholder to the company. I suggest, however, that the general tenor of the passages quoted is that ""payment"" can take such form of satisfaction of the dividend debt as the shareholder may have agreed to accept, whether that agreement is contained in the company's articles of association or is external to them."
Case23135,discussed,Cadbury-Fry-Pascall v Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 31 ; (1944) 70 CLR 362,"In view of the respondent's submissions, it is necessary to consider the effect of s 4(1). By the operation of s 4(1), the Agreements Act incorporates the Assessment Act subject to s 4(2). However, each Act retains its own identity and the imposition of the relevant tax is still imposed by and at the rates declared by the Income Tax (Dividends, Interest and Royalties Withholding Tax) Act 1974 (Cth) and the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 (Cth) by reference to the Assessment Act. The incorporation has the consequence, as a matter of a drafting technique, of incorporating the text of the Assessment Act into the Agreements Act. As Lockhart J said in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1984) 1 FCR 409 at 413: It is not uncommon to find in an Act a provision that an earlier Act is incorporated and shall be read as one with the later Act. The effect of such a provision is to transpose the earlier into the later Act or to write every provision of the earlier Act into the later Act as if they had been actually printed into it. It is a rule of construction of statutes; but it cannot be used in effect to amend the provisions of the earlier Act which is to be read as one with the later Act. Sometimes an Act provides that it is incorporated and shall be read as one with an earlier Act. The effect is the same namely, to transpose the later into the earlier Act. See generally the Canada Southern Railway Co. v The International Bridge Co (1883) 8 AC 723 at 727, per Lord Selborne; Osborne v The Commonwealth [1911] HCA 19 ; (1911) 12 CLR 321 at 342-343, per Barton J Perpetual Trustee Co (Ltd) v Wittscheibe (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 501 at 510, per Jordan CJ; Cadbury-Fry-Pascall Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 31 ; (1944) 70 CLR 362 at 388, per Williams J, and the cases there cited; Tasman Timber Ltd v Minister for Industry and Commerce (1983) 46 ALR 149. 42 Undoubtedly, the drafting technique of incorporation by reference may require necessary adjustments or modifications to be made in the incorporated provisions. In Cadbury-Fry-Pascall Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 31 ; (1944) 70 CLR 362 at 388 Williams J said: The tax is imposed by the Tax Act, which prescribes the rates of taxation. This Act incorporates the Assessment Act and provides that the two Acts are to be read together. My own view, to which I adhere, as to the effect of such a section, is stated in Perpetual Trustee Co (Ltd) v Wittscheibe as follows: ""In re Woods' Estate; Ex parte Her Majesty's Commissioners of Works &amp; Buildings the Court of Appeal held that if a subsequent Act bring into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act, the legal effect of that is to write those sections into the new Act just as if they had been actually printed into it. It has also been held that where two Acts are to be read together the Court must construe every part of each of them as if it had been contained in one Act, unless there is some manifest discrepancy making it necessary to hold that the latter Act has to some extent modified something found in the earlier Act: see Hart v Hudson Bros Ltd ; Phillips v Parnaby , and Williams v Tooth &amp; Co Ltd ."" (Footnotes omitted). See also McGillivray v Piper (2000) 182 ALR 282. 44 However, be that as it may, because s 4(1) is made expressly subject to subs (2), then the real issue in this case is not so much the application of the principles expressed by Williams J in Cadbury 70 CLR at 388, but whether s 4(2) brings about the result contended for by the respondent. This result does not hinge on the reading of the two Acts as one, but upon whether there is any relevant inconsistency between the Agreements Act, and relevantly here, the Assessment Act. It is to be noted that s 4(2) does not only deal with inconsistency in relation to the incorporated Act (namely the Assessment Act), but also with any Act imposing Australian tax. The obvious purpose of s 4(2) is to ensure that the Agreements Act is to prevail, but only in respect of its field of operation and according to its provisions. 45 Section 3(11) operates to determine whether the beneficiary's share of the income may be taxed in Australia in accordance with the business profits article. Such a provision has effect notwithstanding the operation of the withholding tax provisions and s 128(B)(3)(h)(ii) as contended for by the applicant. In my view, s 3(11) facilitates the operation of the business profits article which is only enabling and does not impose any tax itself. Section 3(11) is not in its terms, nor in the context in which it appears, concerned with the operation of s 128B of the Assessment Act and was not intended to so operate. Section 3(11) is not a definition provision which purports to replace the definition of ""permanent establishment"" for the purposes of the application of s 128B(3)(h)(ii). The work of s 3(11) is in connection with Art 7 and enables tax to be imposed in the circumstances set out in the extrinsic materials referred to by the respondent. As I had said, s 3(11) does not impose any tax in itself, or in conjunction with Art 7, assuming it applies. Section 3(11) is not directed to the operation of the withholding tax provisions and provisions that actually impose tax, and was introduced as an enabling provision only to assist in the taxing of distributions to a trust beneficiary which has a non-resident in the context of the business profits article where the concept of a permanent establishment is significant. Each of s 3(11) and s 128B can thus operate without affecting the operation of the other and without any inconsistency."
Case5924,applied,Chan v Cresdon Pty Limited [1989] HCA 63 ; (1989) 168 CLR 242,"the very definition of the word 'mortgage' in s 3 of the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) encompasses a charge on land of the kind created by cl 23, when that is perfected into the instrument of mortgage required to be brought into existence in order to create a registered mortgage of which Wright Designed would be the registered proprietor under s 56 of that Act. Until such registration occurred, Wright Designed's interest in land existed only in equity in the sense explained in Chan v Cresdon Pty Limited [1989] HCA 63 ; (1989) 168 CLR 242. Wright Designed argued that no relevant interest in land could be created because Mr and Mrs McClymont had not executed a mortgage under s 56 of the Real Property Act 1900 and, therefore no interest in land existed at all. This is fundamentally misconceived. It ignores decisions of the High Court on the existence of equitable estates and interests in land under Torrens title: Barry v Heider [1914] HCA 79 ; (1914) 19 CLR 197 at 216 per Isaacs J. In Chan v Cresdon Pty Limited [1989] HCA 63 ; (1989) 168 CLR 242 at 257 Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and McHugh JJ approved Isaacs J's statement that where parties had a right to have an instrument executed and registered, that right according to accepted rules of equity is an estate or interest in the land. Until the instrument is executed neither ss 41 or 56 of the Real Property Act 1900 could affect the matter. If the instrument is executed, inefficacy until it is registered can not cut down or merge the pre-existing right which led to its execution. The antecedent agreement is effective in accordance with the principles of equity to bring into existence an equitable estate or interest in the land. Their Honours pointed out that it was the antecedent agreement, evidenced by the unregistered instrument, not the instrument itself, which created the equitable estate or interest."
Case7532,applied,WALT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCAFC 2,"Before proceeding to consider the Statement of Decision and Reasons in detail it is appropriate to have regard to the observations of Mansfield, Jacobson and Siopis JJ in WALT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCAFC 2 at [28] where their Honours indicated that it is not appropriate for the Tribunal to take on the role of arbiter of doctrine with respect to any religion and then went on to say: '28. ... Degrees of understanding and commitment of those practising any particular faith will vary. To ascribe to all who are, or claim to be, adherents to a particular religion a required minimum standard of practice or a required and consistent minimum understanding of its tenets may be erroneous.' 29 As previously mentioned the Tribunal made reference to the appellant's written statement setting out her reasons for claiming to be a refugee. On the fourth and fifth pages of its Statement of Decision and Reasons the Tribunal proceeded to summarise that statement. The statement was recorded in English and contained within a statutory declaration made by the appellant on 6 February 2006. It contained 11 numbered paragraphs. The appellant claimed to be a Christian (see paragraphs 9 and 11). The appellant claimed to have attended some religious gatherings organised by a family church in her home village from around 2002 (see paragraph 3). She claimed to have been impressed by the kindness of 'religious sisters and brothers' (see paragraph 3). She claimed to have participated in weekly worship on a regular basis (see paragraph 3) and she claimed that in July 2003 she was baptised at a 'religious sister's home in my village' (see paragraph 3). 30 The appellant claimed that the Public Security Bureau ('PSB') took action in respect of religious observance in the area in which the appellant lived (see paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the statement). The appellant claimed that she had been detained for one day in December 2003, that she had been detained for one week in April 2004 and that she was detained for one month from May to June 2005 (see paragraphs 4, 5 and 8). The appellant claimed that to secure her release from detention, she made payments of RMB 1000 yuan, 3000 yuan and 10,000 yuan (see paragraphs 4, 5 and 9)."
Case566,cited,Penrice v Williams (1883) 23 Ch D 353,"In my view there is power to make the order sought. It has always been accepted that a court retains jurisdiction after final judgment to deal with matters involved in or arising in the course of the operation of the court's order. If the need to deal with an order is foreseen the order usually reserves liberty to apply. At any rate a court has inherent power to deal with such matters. That a court retains the ability to deal with matters arising out of its orders does not permit it to grant substantive relief of a kind not originally sought in the proceeding or which is substantially different from that given by the final order: Phillips v Walsh (1990) 20 NSWLR 206, 209. Indeed, reservation of liberty to apply is usually confined to ""questions of machinery which may arise from the implementation of a court's orders"": Abigroup Ltd v Abignano (1992) 112 ALR 497, 509. But it is not limited to matters of machinery. A court can make a variety of orders provided what is involved does not undermine the finality of the orders already made: Penrice v Williams (1883) 23 Ch D 353."

First, the decision below must be attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by this Court; secondly, substantial injustice must be demonstrated if leave were to be refused, supposing the decision to be wrong: at 398. 5 The principal submission made on behalf of the first respondent was that the applicant has not satisfied the first of these requirements. That is, the first respondent submitted that the Federal Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt as to warrant its reconsideration by this Court. 6 It is convenient to note the origins of this proceeding. The applicant filed an application in the High Court for an order nisi on 21 April 2003, which was remitted to the Federal Court by Heydon J on 25 August 2003.

Case12820,applied,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323,"Authority's arguments as to the inadequacy of the Tribunal's reasons were based on these provisions. So far as the argument was based on s 43(2B) it must be rejected. The Full Court of this Court has held that that provision requires the Tribunal to do no more that to state the findings which it has actually made. It does not require the Tribunal to make the findings which it ought to have made: Appellant V324 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 259 at [8] per Hill and Allsop JJ; see also Repatriation Commission v Cotton (2006) 93 ALD 118 at 128 [42] per Rares J; Gilkinson v Repatriation Commission (2008) 104 ALD 406 at 410 [14] per Rares J. That conclusion is inevitable in light of the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 [10] per Gleeson CJ, 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ where it was held that s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which is not materially different to s 43(2B) operated in that manner. There is no obligation to ""make all necessary findings of fact"" the obligation is only to produce reasons which are adequate. In that circumstance, I propose to treat the ground as relating to the duty imposed by s 43(2B). The allegation that s 43(2B) requires the Tribunal to make such findings is, I think, untenable. As I have already noted, that view of s 43(2B) is at odds with the approach held to be required by the High Court to s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in Yusuf . The three questions of law relating to this issue posed by the applicant were as follows: (a) whether the Tribunal made all necessary findings of fact to support its conclusion that the grounds for cancellation of the respondent's CoA relied upon by the applicant for the purposes of CAR 269(1)(d) had not been made out; (f) whether the Tribunal failed to give reasons (or sufficient and adequate reasons) for its decision in breach of s.43 (2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (""the AAT Act""); and (g) further or alternatively, whether the Tribunal failed to include in its reasons findings (or sufficient and adequate findings) on material questions of fact or otherwise failed to refer to the evidence or other material on which such findings were based in breach of s.43 (2B) of the AAT Act. In light of my conclusions, questions (a) and (g) should be answered: ""The Tribunal complied with its obligations under s 43(2B)."" Question (f) should be answered: ""No. The reasons of the Tribunal were not adequate."" Second issue: irrelevant considerations Of course, if Dornan is correct then, additionally, the Tribunal made an error of law. However, the significance of that for present purposes hinges upon whether that conclusion would lead to a different result. Clearly, such an approach would require the Tribunal to produce its reasons again. The difference would be that, if the error of law were jurisdictional the orders of the Tribunal might be set aside, it might have to re-exercise its powers afresh and it might have to do more than just produce reasons. I think it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional. It is true, no doubt, that generally, an error of law will, in the hands of a non-judicial tribunal, be jurisdictional: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. However, it is to be noted that the errors of law there identified as having that effect were said to be those causing an inferior tribunal to identify the wrong issue. It may be doubted whether an error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could ever have that effect for reasons explained in Yusuf ."

Case20833,referred to,Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2003] FCAFC 153 ; (2003) 130 FCR 317,"In this context, the notion of ""jurisdiction"" is the authority to hear and decide to adjudicate: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559 at 570 [2] . One needs, of course, to recognise that within, and bound up with, that notion of authority to adjudicate there is the authority to adjudicate the kind of controversy involved (what might be said to be the subject matter of any proceeding) and also the authority to deal with the particular respondent involved. The second aspect of the question may depend on presence within the jurisdiction (the word ""jurisdiction"" being used here in a territorial or locality sense) or whether relevant local law entitles the service of process outside the jurisdiction: see the comments of Branson J in Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2003] FCAFC 153 ; (2003) 130 FCR 317 at 349 [149] . In Edensor Gleeson CJ, Gaudron J and Gummow J said at 570 [2]: It is convenient to begin with the word ""jurisdiction"". This is a ""generic term"" generally signifying authority to adjudicate. It is used in various senses. The jurisdiction of a court to hear and determine a personal action and to grant relief may depend upon no more than effective service of that court's process upon the defendant within the territorial bounds of its competence or pursuant to the exercise of a ""long-arm"" jurisdiction; or it may depend also upon the proceeding being with respect to a particular subject matter.

The Full Court at 585 approved the observations of Beaumont J in Re Solomon; Ex parte Reid (1986) 10 FCR 423 at 425 426 that, for the purposes of s 41(3)(b) , execution is deemed to have been stayed where the judgment creditor is not in a position to issue immediate execution upon it. Circumstances preventing the judgment creditor from issuing execution include action by the judgment creditor to prevent payment of the debt or the appointment of a receiver over the debtor's property by order of the court so that the debtor, ' in practical reality ' is prevented from paying the debt ( Wiltshire-Smith at 586 587). The onus is on the debtor to prove affirmatively that the claim in respect of which the bankruptcy notice was issued could and would have been paid but for some act or omission which has the practical effect, in a business sense, of preventing the debtor from paying the debt ( Boscolo v Botany Council [1996] FCA 897 per Jenkinson J at 8 with whom O'Loughlin J agreed and per Sackville J at 4)."

Case4628,referred to,County Securities Pty Ltd v Challenger Group Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 193 ,"it was submitted that if, contrary to the foregoing submissions, I was to find that any principle coming out of Manning can apply by way of analogy to the present case, there were four reasons why it was fair and just to reconsider the matter rather than be persuaded that SMS had established the amended statement of claim was an abuse of process. These were put as follows: (1) Dr Windsor was self-represented on the hearing of the 2007 notice of motion. (2) I applied impermissible criteria in deciding the 2007 notice of motion clearly a strike-out application rather than confining myself to the pleadings; had I done the latter, I would have dismissed the 2007 notice of motion. I have already accepted this submission at [12] and [13] above. (3) On the hearing of the 2007 notice of motion, the Court's attention was not drawn to the undecided question of law about whether post-contractual conduct and communications could be used to identify parties to the contract (see Dennis Pethybridge v Stedikas Holdings Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 154 ; (2007) Aust Contract R &#167;90-263 at [59] per Campbell JA (Beazley JA agreeing); Sagacious Procurements Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Ltd (formerly Mayne Group Ltd) [2008] NSWCA 149 at [99] ff per Giles JA (Hodgson and Campbell JJA agreeing); County Securities Pty Ltd v Challenger Group Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 193 at [161] per McColl JA), and at least some of the Judgment Documents fall within that category. (4) The fact that on the hearing of the 2007 notice of motion my attention was not drawn to admissions that were relied upon on the hearing of the current motion and, even if I did have regard to them on the earlier occasion, there is no indication on the face of the reasons for judgment that I interacted with them."
Case2961,cited,CGU Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd v Garcia (2007) 69 NSWLR 680,"The respondents admit they breached an implied term of the Offer Letter, namely that the respondents would not seek to prevent performance of the Offer Letter or withhold its benefits: Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68, 70-71 cited and referred to in Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investment Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 , 607; Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd v Southern Pacific Petroleum NL [2005] VSCA 228 and CGU Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd v Garcia (2007) 69 NSWLR 680. The event which the respondents said gave rise to the breach was the execution of the Woolworths' Letter of Offer on 18 March 2008. However, despite the generous admission of the respondents, I cannot accept that execution of the 18 March 2008 letter constituted a breach of the Butt v M'Donald term. 54 The respondents disputed that they had breached cl 26 on the basis that unless and until Coles proffered an AFL that they wanted to execute, there could be no breach and that no such AFL was proffered by Coles until 23 June 2008.

Case8696,considered,Williams v Minister for the Environment and Heritage (2003) 74 ALD 124,"was pointed out in Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1992) 178 CLR 408 by Brennan J at 433 that s 16(1)(d) does not enable the Court to make an order against a party in litigation where no ground for relief under the general law is established against that party. There must, his Honour said, be "" legal reference points by which to steer "". The power is in addition to the power to quash or set aside an impugned decision ( Park Oh Ho v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 54 ; (1989) 167 CLR 637 at 644). It does not enable orders to be made against persons who were not in any way involved in the processes or procedures which led to the decision under review and who benefit from the decision, if at all, only indirectly; those persons are, in that sense, strangers to the decision ( Johns at 459 per Gaudron J). Johns was applied by Wilcox J in Williams v Minister for the Environment and Heritage (2003) 74 ALD 124 (' Williams No 1 ') to refuse relief by way of a restraining order against a joined third party under s 16(1)(d) of the ADJR Act, even after a refusal to make a s 9 declaration was declared invalid and set aside. His Honour concluded that such an order was beyond power. On the application for interlocutory relief following the decision of Wilcox J, Lindgren J expressed the view in Williams v Minister for the Environment and Heritage [2003] FCA 627 ; (2003) 199 ALR 352 (' Williams No 2 ') at [31] that there was not an arguable case that Wilcox J had erred in his view that Johns obliged him to refuse the interlocutory injunction. That is, Lindgren J expressed the view at [40] that a party seeking an injunction under s 16(1)(d) of the ADJR Act must establish a ""right"" to it under general law principles. Specifically, his Honour concluded at [44] that the general law does not recognise an Aboriginal person as having an interest in the specified area in an application under the Protection Act, protectable by injunctive relief. The right given by s 9 is to apply for a ministerial declaration and that does not constitute such an interest."
Case19144,cited,Commodore Business Machines Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 92 ALR 563,"I am persuaded that it is appropriate for an order to be made restraining the respondent from using the name ""Chatswood BBQ King"" as the name of, or otherwise in connection with, the respondent's restaurant. However, I am not persuaded that the restraint should extend to the use of the individual words and phrases ""BBQ King"", ""BBQ Kings"", ""BBQ"", ""King"" and ""Kings"". Rather, in my view, the appropriate approach is that exemplified by the injunction ultimately made in Turner v General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd [1929] HCA 22 ; (1929) 42 CLR 352 which was discussed in Commodore Business Machines Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 92 ALR 563 at 575.

Case19642,cited,"McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [2001] FCA 1700 , 114 FCR 574","to those other statutory provisions which authorise the issue of a notice requiring the production of information or documents, however, has been the concern of the Court to ensure that each of the statutory demands that may be authorised is construed in a practical and common sense manner. Notwithstanding the difference in language as between s 155 of the 1974 Act and s 264 of the 1936 Act, for example, a similar approach has been adopted when considering the degree of certainty required in a notice issued under s 264: McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [2001] FCA 1700 at [50] , [2001] FCA 1700 ; 114 FCR 574 at 590 per Sackville J. Ambiguity may be discerned by those with initiative to find uncertainty where none really exists. But that is not the manner in which any of the notices have been construed in the decided cases. The more obscure a category of "" document or thing "" may be, the greater may be the imperative for that "" document or thing "" to be described with a degree of specificity or definiteness so that the person upon whom a statutory notice is given may be capable of identifying that "" document or thing "" and thereafter producing it. It may be necessary at some stage to give greater content to the constraints that are imposed by the use of the term "" specify "" in s 29. That term may well require a greater degree of precision in the identification of the "" document or thing "" required to be produced than has been found appropriate in other statutory contexts. That greater degree of precision emerges from the statutory language employed in s 29. And reason for greater specificity may also be required by the very generality of the power conferred by s 29 upon an examiner. There is no express requirement, for example, that a notice issued under s 29 identify on its face the particular ambit of the "" special ACC operation/investigation "" in respect to which the "" document or thing "" is considered to be "" relevant "". There is thus no requirement to identify anything as to the surrounding circumstances, however broadly they may be expressed, within which a person served with a notice can consider the factual or other context within which the power is being exercised. Section 264(1)(a) is not so confined and permits what has been described as a "" fishing expedition "": Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1977] FCA 23 ; (1979) 143 CLR 499 at 515 at 535 to 536 per Mason J. Section 264(1)(a) may only be confined by the need to ensure that that power is exercised for the broadly expressed purposes elsewhere set forth in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth): Industrial Equity Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 46 ; (1990) 170 CLR 649 at 659 to 660. A notice issued under s 264(1)(a) need not reveal on its face that the Commissioner is entitled to require the information specified in the notice; it is enough for the notice or the covering letter to record that the information is required for the purposes of the 1936 Act: McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [2001] FCA 1700 at [46] , [2001] FCA 1700 ; 114 FCR 574 at 589 per Sackville J.

Case23321,cited,Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378,"This Court has an implied incidental power to prevent an abuse of its processes. The jurisdiction of a superior court to prevent its processes from an abuse of process was considered by the High Court in Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378. In that case, the High Court was concerned with complaints against three medical practitioners which were laid but not prosecuted in the Medical Tribunal and then re-laid after a Royal Commission had reported adversely on the conduct of the practitioners. On an application to the Court, the Court of Appeal in New South Wales stayed the new complaints on the ground that they were so unfairly and unjustly oppressive as to constitute an abuse of process. 56 Chief Justice Mason, Deane and Dawson JJ said at 392-393: The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness. Thus, it has long been established that, regardless of the propriety of the purpose of the person responsible for their institution and maintenance, proceedings will constitute an abuse of process if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail. ... Yet again, proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it sought to litigate a newer case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings. (Footnotes omitted.) 57 The respondents contended that this Court should find that this proceeding is an abuse of process."
Case6223,applied,R v Tait (1979) 24 ALR 473,"principles were referred to again by another Full Court in R v Tait (1979) 24 ALR 473, following which the Court said (at 476): ""An appellate court does not interfere with the sentence imposed merely because it is of the view that that sentence is insufficient or excessive. It interferes only if it be shown that the sentencing judge was in error in acting on a wrong principle or in misunderstanding or in wrongly assessing some salient feature of the evidence. The error may appear in what the sentencing judge said in the proceedings, or the sentence itself may be so excessive or inadequate as to manifest such error (see generally, Skinner v R [1913] HCA 32 ; (1913) 16 CLR 336 at 339-40; R v Withers (1925) 25 SR (NSW) 382 at 394; Whittaker v R [1928] HCA 28 ; (1928) 41 CLR 230 at 249; Griffiths v R (1977) 15 ALR 1 at 15-17)."" As indicated at [14] above, the appellant identified two errors in the sentencing procedure in the present case. The first was said to be a failure to consider all possible alternatives to full-time imprisonment, contrary to the provisions of s 17A of the Crimes Act . The difficulty with this alleged error is that, at the time of sentencing, his Honour said: ""I have considered all other appropriate penalties and I consider nothing other than full-time gaol is the appropriate penalty ..."" In my view, this alleged error cannot be sustained. The other error in the sentencing procedure identified by the appellant is the alleged failure of his Honour to apply and properly record the utilitarian discount given for a plea of guilty. In prefacing the imposed sentence, his Honour did refer to the appellant's guilty plea and was obviously mindful of it. It is just not possible to know to what extent, if any, his Honour took it into account in the exercise of his sentencing discretion. I would not be prepared to interfere with the sentence his Honour imposed on the basis of this alleged error. In my view, the only real question raised by this appeal is whether the nature of the sentence imposed, when considered in relation to the offences and the circumstances of the case, is so excessive as to manifest ""convincing evidence"" that in some way the exercise of the discretion has miscarried or is unsound. As the authorities to which I have referred make clear, it is not enough that I might regard the sentence as greater than what I would have imposed. It appears to be common ground between the appellant and the Crown that no person convicted of the offences for which the appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted has been incarcerated in prison. Custodial sentences have been imposed but invariably have been effectively suspended by orders made pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act directing the immediate release of the offender sentenced to imprisonment upon giving security, by recognizance or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court, for compliance with the conditions referred to in para (a) of s 20(1). However, those facts themselves do not lead to the conclusion that the sentence imposed on the appellant was so excessive as to manifest ""convincing evidence"" that the exercise of his Honour's discretion miscarried. Any such conclusion could only be reached by weighing those comparative facts against the maximum penalties as a measure of the seriousness with which the legislature views such offences five years imprisonment for the Copyright Act offences having regard to the principle of general deterrence, the need for specific deterrence particularly in the face of conviction for a past similar offence, rejecting as I do, the appellant's submission for discounting this factor for the media publicity this case received, and the scale of the illegal commercial operation carried on by the appellant. So weighed and measured, the sentence imposed by his Honour does not, on its face, exhibit the character of being so excessive that the exercise of the discretion is put in doubt. I have come to the conclusion that I should not interfere with the term of imprisonment of 12 months for each offence to be served concurrently, however, I reduce the non-release period from eight months to three months on the same recognizance.

Case14296,cited,Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Arthur Anderson &amp; Co (1997) 70 SASR 166,"I set out earlier Mr Gurtler's affidavit evidence concerning his proposed joinder of Mr Turnbull. While his evidence related to the fact that he gave instructions to Williams &amp; Hughes to apply to have Mr Turnbull joined and that instruction was acted upon he did not either expressly or impliedly refer to, let alone put in issue, the character or contents of any communications made to, or by, Williams and Hughes. While Finance Now has put in issue the reasons why Mr Gurtler proposed to join Mr Turnbull and Mr Gurtler has sought to answer that, he has not done so in a fashion which could reasonably relate his reasons for the decision, explicitly or implicitly, to communications made in the lawyer-client relationship. Thus he has not engaged in conduct which is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of lawyer-client communications. Whatever was the substance of the communications made by Williams &amp; Hughes to Mr Gurtler and Mr Van Noort which related to the decision to join Mr Turnbull and which are listed in Mr Gurtler's affidavit, there is on the material before me no reasonable grounds for believing that legal advice contributed to that decision: cf Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Arthur Anderson &amp; Co (1997) 70 SASR 166 at 175-176. 58 It has been put on behalf of Mr Gurtler that while the email should neither have been couched in the terms it was nor have been sent at all, all it involved was a sharp practice and demonstrated a lack of commercial probity: cf Southern Equities Corporation at 174. The email itself indicated that the accounts had been analysed and the conclusion arrived at from that analysis (i.e. the accounts were ""cracked""). It also indicated that the stated conclusion were, in Mr Van Noort's view, supported by the bank statements. This, it is said, is not an allegation of fraud knowingly raised without any basis. A sufficient basis had been given at that stage the matter was not as yet the subject of a pleading and that was enough to dispel the allegation of deliberately improper purpose. 59 My own view is that the email was a disreputable and inflammatory vehicle through which to make imputations against Mr Hambrett and, by implication, Mr Turnbull. This said, the email does not have the particular character ascribed to it by Finance Now. It cannot be said that it lacks any disclosed and proper basis for its core allegation ""the accounts are a complete and total fabrication"". On this I agree with the submissions made by Mr Gurtler. Yet it is upon the supposed lack of such a basis that the challenge to the claim of legal professional privilege has been made. Reliance, as Finance Now places, on the apparent regularity of the accounts on their face as a foundation for asserting there were prima facie grounds for saying there was no proper basis for the allegations of fraud, simply ignores the basis of the allegation being made. I equally agree that, at the time the allegation was made, i.e. prior to the pleading of the alleged fraud, the basis given for the allegation was sufficient to dispel the assertion that it lacked foundation. Whether it proves to be correct or not is not of present concern. 60 I cannot in the circumstances see why Mr Gurtler's alleged failure to withdraw the allegation is in any way of assistance to Finance Now. Nor do I consider he can relevantly be faulted for present purposes for not disavowing the sharp and unauthorised practice of his agent. There is no material before me suggesting Mr Gurtler knew of, and condoned that practice. While, as a matter of reasonable commercial standards, one may have expected some reassurance from Mr Gurtler of appropriate behaviour in ""the Federal court action"" an action in any event subject to judicial management and scrutiny the lack of this is not, in the circumstances, suggestive of the improper purpose alleged."
Case22540,cited,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"As stated in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [91] : An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect. Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition. Unfortunately, a finding of purpose or no purpose in this context often reflects a contestable judgment. 71 The Act does provide for the possibility of variation of a Part A competition notice but specifies in s 151AOA that, while the notice is in force, variation can only be of a minor nature. The proposed variations cannot be said to fall into this category. 72 Part XIB does not envisage that a Part A competition notice may issue with retrospective effect. If an invalid Part A competition notice were subsequently validated by the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act , the re-construed or amended notice would have retrospective effect for the period that the initial Part A competition notice would have been in force."
Case23008,cited,"Charlie Carter Pty Ltd v Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association of Western Australia (1987) 13 FCR 413","These propositions are not inconsistent with the authorities that state that particulars cannot be used to fill gaps in the material facts that must be alleged: Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712 per Scott LJ; H 1976 Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli (1979) 40 FLR 242 at 246; Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd (1985) 7 FCR 109; and Charlie Carter Pty Ltd v Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association of Western Australia (1987) 13 FCR 413 ( 'Charlie Carter' ) at 419. That proposition is directed towards material facts that must be alleged to constitute a complete cause of action. 37 It can be difficult to distinguish between a material fact and a particular: Charlie Carter at 417 per French J. The difference often turns upon the level of generality at which the material facts are alleged in a particular pleading. Consistently with the rules of pleading, a cause of action can be pleaded at different levels of generality, depending upon the nature of the case and the subject matter in question. A pleader is not compelled to plead primary or evidentiary facts. Most pleadings will set forth the material facts at a level which involves some element of conclusion concerning the factual ingredients of the cause of action. But, whatever level of generality is adopted in the statement of claim, it must adhere to the basic principle that the purpose of pleadings is to define the issues and thereby inform the parties in advance of the case they have to meet and so enable them to take steps to deal with it: Charlie Carter at 417. On the other hand, a pleading will infringe the applicable practice rules if it contains nothing more than broad conclusions asserted at such a high level of generality that the opposite party cannot understand the case it has to meet: see, eg, Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd, supra, at 113-115. 38 In Charlie Carter , French J summed up the applicable principles at 417 by saying that: 'The sufficiency of the pleading may be judged first by reference to the necessary condition that it disclose a reasonable cause of action and secondly, by reference to the requirement for sufficient particularity that the respondents know in advance the case they have to meet.' I am not satisfied that Finkelstein J departed, or intended to depart, from this principle. 39 The applicants argued that no account should be taken of the directions which Finkelstein J made for further particularisation of the cross claims. They relied essentially on two grounds: first, they submitted that the reasons for decision do not mention the prospect that any lack of particularity in the cross claims could be remedied by the provision of particulars; and secondly, they submitted that particulars cannot cure a defective pleading which does not set out the material facts that are required to constitute a reasonable cause of action. As to the first ground, I do not see why it should be assumed that Finkelstein J was oblivious to the possibility that any lack of particularity of the kind complained by the applicants could be cured by the provision of particulars. After all, his Honour made orders relating to particulars on 7 July 2006. As to the second ground, the applicants did not contend that the lack of particularity about which they complained had the consequence that the cross claims disclosed no reasonable cause of action against Baker &amp; McKenzie and Munro."
Case15304,referred to,APN News &amp; Media Ltd (2007) 62 ACSR 400,"I discussed provisions of this kind in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd (2007) 62 ACSR 400 ( APN ) at [25]-[55], and indicated (at [55]) that it seemed to be desirable that applications under s 411(1) be supported by affidavit evidence directed to showing certain matters. 23 In the present case there are limited no-talk and no-shop provisions in cl 11 of the MIA and a break fee provision in cl 12 of the MIA. The ""no-talk period"" and ""no-shop period"" are defined to mean the period from 16 August 2007 until the earliest to occur of either 31 December 2007, the termination of the MIA in accordance with its terms, or the coming into effect under s 411(10) of the Act of the Court's Order under s 411(4)(b) approving the Scheme. Thus, the longest the period can be is from 16 August 2007 to 31 December 2007. I think I am entitled to take judicial notice of the fact that this period of some four and a half months is not unreasonably long by reference to the periods that one sees in similar provisions in schemes of the present kind. 24 The no-talk and no-shop provisions are related to the concept of a ""Competing Proposal"". There is a ""fiduciary carve out"" from the no-talk provision in cl 11.3 of the MIA. 25 By cl 11.4, CFI undertakes, during the no-shop period, to inform Sunsuper of any competing approaches made to CFI. 26 Importantly, Sunsuper has no relevant interest in shares in CFI (in contrast to the position that prevailed in APN 62 ACSR 400). Accordingly, there is no scope for an argument that Sunsuper used its position as a CFI shareholder with ""representation"" on CFI's Board of Directors, somehow to lock the CFI shareholders into the Scheme. 27 I turn now to the break fee for which cl 12 of the MIA provides. The amount of that fee is $1 million. As noted in APN 62 ACSR 400 at [48], the Takeovers Panel's Guidance Note 7, Lock-up Devices (2 nd issue, 2005) states (at [7.18]) that the Panel uses a guideline that a break fee should not exceed 1% of the ""equity value"" of the target, and for this purpose the equity value is the aggregate of the value of all classes of equity securities issued by the target. It will be recalled (see [8] above) that in the present case, the ""equity value"" of CFI is stated by Deloitte to lie between $104.8 million and $111 million. I note also that the aggregate consideration is $108,187,617.88 (135,573,456 shares x $0.798 per share). The break fee of $1 million dollars is below the 1% level. 28 By cl 12.1(c) of the MIA, CFI's Board of Directors acknowledged that it had received legal advice in connection with cl 12 and believed that the Scheme would provide benefit to CFI and CFI shareholders and that it was reasonable and appropriate for CFI to agree to the break fee in order to secure Sunsuper's participation in the transaction. 29 By cl 12.2(a) of the MIA, the parties acknowledged that the amount of $1 million represented ""a genuine and reasonable pre-estimate of the transaction costs it [sic that] will have been incurred by Sunsuper"". 32 In the circumstances I think that although affidavit evidence to the effect described by me in APN 62 ACSR 400 was not led (I remain of the view that affidavit evidence is desirable), I am entitled to infer, as I do, by reason of the terms of the MIA and the other circumstances referred to above, that the matters to which I referred in that case (at [55]) are established. 33 For the above reasons I made the orders referred to earlier for the convening of the Scheme meeting and approving the draft Scheme Booklet as the registered explanatory statement. I certify that the preceding thirty-three (33) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.

Case12875,cited,Karen Millen Ltd v Dunnes Stores Ltd [2008] ECDR 11,"contrary to the Respondents' submissions, distinctiveness is to be assessed not by comparing the design in question to the prior art base as a whole but by comparing it individually to each relevant piece of prior art: s 15(1) read with ss 16(1) and (2).

As a result, a design that combines various features, each of which can be found in the prior art base when considered as a whole but not in any one particular piece of prior art, is capable of being distinctive: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [60] ; Karen Millen Ltd v Dunnes Stores Ltd [2008] ECDR 11 at [82]-[84] (stating that the registered design must be assessed with regard to particular prior designs rather than a hypothetical amalgam of a number of prior designs).

Case20714,considered,NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51,"was conceded on behalf of the Minister that jurisdictional error could be constituted by the Tribunal's overlooking of a relevant consideration but that to make this out it had to be demonstrated that a whole aspect of a visa applicant's case had been overlooked, not just a particular document. Examples of this were said to be found in WAIJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 568 ( WAIJ ) and NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 ( NAJT ). In contrast to WAIJ , Dranichnikov is not expressly mentioned in the reasons of the majority (Madgwick J, Conti J agreeing) in NAJT . However, that part of those reasons in NAJT which upholds the allegation that there had been a jurisdictional error constituted by a failure on the part of the Tribunal to ""have regard"" to a corroborative letter (147 FCR at 92-93, [212] [213]) is consistent with the error found in Dranichnikov and with the classification by the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action of that error as a type of procedural fairness error. Further, the letter concerned in that case had not been completely ignored but rather the subject of ""fleeting, uncritical references""."
Case109,considered,Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576,"In Kioa , it was also made clear that an applicant entitled to natural justice is entitled to be told of adverse information obtained by the decision-maker from third parties and which he or she proposes to take into account and to be given the opportunity to respond to that information. Brennan J referred to the obligation and identified its limits in the following passage (at 628-629) (footnotes omitted): 'A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise: Kanda v Government of Malay ; Ridge v Baldwin per Lord Morris; De Verteuil v Knaggs . The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information, irrespective of its credibility, relevance or significance. Administrative decision-making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made. Administrative decisions are not necessarily to be held invalid because the procedures of adversary litigation are not fully observed. As Lord Diplock observed in Bushell v Environment Secretary : ""To 'over-judicialise' the inquiry by insisting on observance of the procedures of a court of justice which professional lawyers alone are competent to operate effectively in the interests of their clients would not be fair."" Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made. It is not sufficient for the repository of the power to endeavour to shut information of that kind out of his mind and to reach a decision without reference to it. Information of that kind creates a real risk of prejudice, albeit subconscious, and it is unfair to deny a person whose interests are likely to be affected by the decision an opportunity to deal with the information. He will be neither consoled nor assured to be told that the prejudicial information was left out of account. The allegation in par 22 was apparently credible, relevant and damaging. The failure to give Mr Kioa an opportunity to deal with it before making an order that Mr and Mrs. Kioa be deported left a risk of prejudice which ought to have been removed. There was nothing in the circumstances of the case - neither in the administrative framework created by the Act nor in any need for secrecy or speed in making the decision - which would have made it unreasonable to have given Mr and Mrs Kioa that opportunity. The failure to give Mr Kioa that opportunity amounts to a non-observance of the principles of natural justice.' The principle referred to in this passage is well established and, for present purposes, needs no further elaboration (see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 (' Alphaone ') at 590-591. 100 The principles governing the applicant's third submission are relatively clear, although they can give rise to difficulties in terms of application. Ordinarily, a decision-maker is not required to invite comment from an applicant as to the decision-maker's provisional views or mental processes ( F Hoffman-La Roche and Co AG v Secretary for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 per Lord Diplock at 369). However, a decision-maker may be under an obligation to invite comment from an applicant on an adverse conclusion based on known material if that conclusion is not an obvious and natural conclusion from that material. In Alphaone , the Full Court of this Court (Northrop, Miles and French JJ) put the matter in the following way (at 591-592): 'Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.' 102 The principle was referred to in passing by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 219 [21] - [22] (footnotes omitted): 'Further, it does not readily appear how the principles of procedural fairness could be engaged in the manner contended for by the prosecutor. It may be accepted, as the prosecutor submitted, that his entitlement extended to the rebuttal of, and comment by way of submission upon, adverse material received by the decision-maker from other sources. That stops short of supporting a complaint of the nature essentially involved here of the ""pitch"" or ""balance"" in the statement of relevant considerations in the Submission. Further, as indicated above, there is no substance in any complaint of unfair or prejudicial ""lack of balance"". Reference was made by the prosecutor to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd . Nothing there said supports any different conclusion to that just expressed. The Full Court's statement of principle was as follow: ""Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.""' 103 Alphaone was also referred to in the recent decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63. That case raised a question as to whether the Refugee Review Tribunal had advised, or sufficiently advised, an applicant for review of matters it relied on in dismissing the application. The case turned on the obligation of the Tribunal under s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the facts of the case. The Court did make some observations about what was said to be a dichotomy between an obligation to advise of adverse conclusions which have been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material, and the lack of an obligation to advise of a decision-maker's mental processes or provisional views. After referring to the passage in Alphaone set out in [100] above, the Court said (at [30], [31] and [32]) (footnotes omitted) : 'Particular attention was directed in argument in this Court, as it had been in the courts below, to the Tribunal's conclusion that the three identified elements of the appellant's story were not ""plausible"". Was that a conclusion ""which would not obviously be open on the known material""? Or was it no more than a part of the ""mental processes"" by which the Tribunal arrived at its decision? Stated in this way, the argument seeks to elucidate the content of the requirements of procedural fairness by setting up a dichotomy. There are two reasons to exercise considerable care in approaching the problem in that way. First, it is far from clear that the two categories that are identified (conclusions not obviously open on the known material, and mental processes of decision-making) encompass all possible kinds of case that may fall for consideration. Secondly, there is a very real risk that focusing upon these two categories will distract attention from the fundamental principles that are engaged. In Alphaone the Full Court rightly said: ""It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material."" (emphasis added) The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited ""to give evidence and present arguments relating to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"". (emphasis added) The reference to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"" is important.' Towards the end of the reasons for judgment, the Court made the following observation (at [49]): 'Finally, even if the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review are properly identified to the applicant, there may yet be cases which would yield to analysis in the terms identified by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone . It would neither be necessary nor appropriate to now foreclose that possibility.'"

Case22855,cited,Devenish v Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 7 ; (1991) 172 CLR 32,"What s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act requires is that trade or commerce be prevented or substantially hindered. It appears to be accepted generally that ""hindering"" in this context must be given a broad meaning, so that it conveys in any way affecting to an appreciable extent the ease of the usual way of performing the activity concerned. The authorities are referred to in Australian Builders' Labourers' Federated Union of Workers &#8722; Western Australian Branch v J-Corp Pty Limited (1993) 42 FCR 452 at 459-460 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ, especially the passage quoted there from the judgment of Mason CJ in Devenish v Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 7 ; (1991) 172 CLR 32 at 45-46. There is no suggestion in the present case that the ease with which Rural Export ensured the supply of feed to the feedlot was affected in a negative way to any extent. It simply had to do more of what it would normally have been required to do, during a longer period than it would have been required to do it. It is possible that Rural Export's capacity to do other things in conducting its trade or commerce might have been affected by the need to spend extra time ordering and directing the delivery of extra feed. There is no evidence to this effect, however. It is said that Rural Export had to spend more money on feed than it otherwise would have in respect of this consignment of sheep. On that basis, it appears to me that the only way in which it could be said that Rural Export's trade or commerce has been hindered would be if it were to be accepted that being obliged to spend more money and to carry out the actions necessary to order and procure the delivery of further feed, in order for Rural Export to discharge its responsibilities with respect to the particular consignment of sheep, amounts to having its trade or commerce hindered. This may require an expansion of the concept of hindering beyond that with which the authorities seem to deal. As the authorities stand, I am unable to say that the trade or commerce of Rural Export was hindered, whether substantially or otherwise."

There is nothing unreasonable in the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence before it. There was evidence to which the Tribunal referred that allowed for a conclusion that the appellant's claims were not plausible. He and his family had lived in the same residence (whilst in Lithuania) since 1998 or 1999. His wife worked. His son attended school. The appellant travelled to other parts of Europe, apparently without difficulty, and re-entered Lithuania, again apparently without difficulty. Whilst in those other countries, he had never taken the opportunity to apply for protection, notwithstanding his complaint that he has been subject to discrimination since 1984. On that evidence, the Tribunal could find that his claims were not plausible. That was not the only finding that was open but it was open. As the first respondent rightly contends, in the absence of any manifest unreasonableness or illogicality ( Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 355-6 and 368; NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 at [115] ; see also Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [137] - [138] ), the findings made by the Tribunal are findings of fact which should not be disturbed by this Court on appeal: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67]; Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35 36."

Case21682,cited,King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd (2001) 184 ALR 98,"This is an application for interlocutory injunctive relief pending the trial of proceedings which were instituted on 15 February 2006. THE NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS 2 The applicant is an academic at the University of Ballarat (""UB""). He is presently employed as a senior lecturer and course co-ordinator of the Bachelor of Arts (Humanities and Social Sciences) course at the Mt Helen campus of UB. He is a member of the National Tertiary Education Industry Union (""NTEU"") and holds two official positions with it, namely a member of its national council since 1998 and branch president of its UB branch since 2000. 3 The proceedings are brought by the applicant as a representative party pursuant to Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (""the FCA Act ""). According to the application, the group members whom the applicant represents are 'all academic staff and general staff (other than casual academic staff, casual general staff and TAFE general staff)' employed by UB as at 14 February 2006. 4 The proceedings arise out of allegedly misleading statements that were made by UB to its staff members on 14 December 2005 (""the December 2005 statements""). The applicant alleges that the December 2005 statements contravened s 170WG(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (""the WR Act ""), which provides: ""(2) A person must not knowingly make a false or misleading statement to another person with the intention of persuading the other person to make, or not to make, an AWA or ancillary document."" The December 2005 statements were made in the context of UB offering Australian Workplace Agreements (""AWAs"") to its staff. 5 The final relief sought in the proceeding comprises: (a) the imposition of penalties on UB under s 170VV of the WR Act; (b) a declaration that UB contravened s 170WG(2) of the WR Act; (c) injunctions requiring UB to refrain from knowingly making a false or misleading statement to the group members with the intention of persuading them to make an AWA, and to publish a correcting statement; and (d) damages and interest. 6 The applicant seeks the following interlocutory relief pending the hearing and determination of the application or further order: (a) UB refrain from offering, entering into or taking any step to make, formalise, register or have approved an AWA with a group member; (b) UB refrain from knowingly making a false or misleading statement to the group members and/or each of them with the intention of persuading group members and/or each of them to make an AWA; and (c) UB cease contravening s 170WG(2) by publishing to each group member a statement correcting the false and/or misleading statements referred to in the affidavit of the applicant sworn 14 February 2006. BACKGROUND 7 In recent years, the terms and conditions of employment of staff at UB have been governed by an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement known as the University of Ballarat Enterprise Agreement for Academic and General Staff, 2000-2003 (""the EBA""). The EBA was made pursuant to s 170LJ of the WR Act . Although its nominal expiry date was 30 June 2003, the effect of s 170LX is that it continues to govern the terms and conditions of the employment of relevant employees of UB, other than those employees who have subsequently entered into an operative AWA with UB. 8 Between June 2003 and late 2005, various efforts were made by the NTEU and/or UB to introduce a new agreement that would govern the terms and conditions of employment at UB. Initially, the NTEU unsuccessfully sought to negotiate an agreement pursuant to s 170LJ. Subsequently, UB made two unsuccessful attempts to make an agreement directly with its academic and general employees pursuant to s 170LK. The first of these proposed s 170LK agreements went to a ballot of staff members between 17 and 21 October 2005. The ballot rejected the proposed agreement, with 451 staff members voting against the agreement and 335 for it. The second proposed agreement went to a ballot of staff members between 22 and 23 November 2005. Again, the ballot resulted in a rejection of the agreement, with 401 staff members voting against it and 323 voting in favour of it. In connection with these two ballots, the NTEU and UB distributed a considerable amount of information and other material to affected staff members. This material drew attention to differences that existed between the proposed s 170LK agreements and the provisions of the EBA. 9 After the failure of the second ballot, UB commenced offering AWAs to its staff members. The AWAs were, broadly speaking, modelled on the agreements which had been rejected by the ballots. THE ALLEGEDLY MISLEADING STATEMENTS 10 UB commenced offering AWAs to staff members by way of an email sent by the Vice Chancellor of UB to all staff members on 14 December 2005. The email attached a link by means of which a copy of the proposed general staff AWA could be viewed by staff members. 11 On 14 December 2005, shortly after the dispatch of the Vice Chancellor's email, Mr Wesley Walker on behalf of UB sent an email to all staff concerning the AWAs (""the December 2005 email""). Mr Walker was a consultant to UB in relation to workplace relations. He was heavily engaged in the unsuccessful efforts to introduce a new agreement governing staff terms and conditions in the period between 2003 and late 2005. The December 2005 email was headed 'AWA Questions', and provided as follows: ""The University has commenced offering AWAs to staff, as notified in an email earlier today. The NTEU has also started its campaign against AWAs by placing posters around the campus that ask you to consider four questions. Well, I'm happy to answer those questions. Q1. Will you be giving away key employment conditions? A. No you won't. All the important employment conditions including hours of work, span of hours, overtime, shift penalties, HDAs, superannuation, incremental progression, meal breaks, and all leave entitlements remain unchanged in the AWA. Q2. Will an AWA now guarantee you future pay increases? A. Yes it will. Three pay increases are guaranteed. An increase of 4.5%, back-paid to July 2004 is guaranteed for those employees signing AWAs prior to 31 March 2006. An increase of 4.5% in January 2006 is guaranteed. An increase of 4.5% in January 2007 is guaranteed. A fourth increase of 4.5% in January 2008 is contingent as before, but is very likely to be paid in full. Q3. Will you be diminishing your job security? A. No you won't. The AWA has nothing to do with your job security. The AWA is concerned with your terms and conditions of employment, just like the proposed collective enterprise agreement. There is no connection between the AWA and your contract of employment. If you have a continuing appointment now, you will still have your continuing appointment after you sign the AWA. Q4. Will you have the right to return to the collective agreement when the AWA expires? A. Yes you will. After the AWA reaches its expiry date it can be replaced by another AWA with further benefits, or it can roll on in its present form, or you can terminate it and return to the collective agreement that is in place at the time. In addition the question and response below should be of special interest to staff. Q5. What happens if a new enterprise agreement (LK to LJ) is settled next year and has conditions better than those contained in the AWA? The University Council at its meeting on 13 December 2005 passed the following resolution 'That any new HEWRR * Compliant EB Agreement (LK to LJ) be settled with conditions of employment and salary levels that are overall not greater than those specified in the collective AWAs available to general staff and academic staff.' Agreements settled after 31 March 2006 will have the requirement that any payment of back-pay, at the very best, be limited to 1 January 2006. Also an AWA may be varied during its operation if the employee and University agree. I'll be happy to answer any other questions you may have about AWAs, but please be a little patient because of the workload this activity has now generated."" The applicant founds his case of misleading statements on this email. 12 The applicant alleges that the statements which appear under Question 1 and Question 3 are false and misleading, and contravene s 170WG(2). The essence of the complaint is that, in respect of important employment issues, namely redundancy, probationary employment, termination and discipline and dispute settling procedures, there are significant differences between the terms and conditions in the proposed AWA when compared with the prevailing terms and conditions in the EBA. I shall not attempt to detail the material differences between the two sets of terms and conditions. They are helpfully summarised in the applicant's outline of written submissions. It is unnecessary to set out the detailed differences because UB concedes that there are differences and that the differences are not insignificant. 13 The applicant contends that the statement which appears in the December 2005 email under Question 1 is false and misleading because the significant differences that do exist make it clear that staff members will in fact lose 'key employment conditions' under the AWA which they would otherwise be entitled to under the EBA. Further, he contends that the significant differences that exist between the two sets of conditions also make it clear that 'important employment conditions' in the EBA have been changed by the proposed AWA. UB acknowledges that changes have been made, but disputes the proposition that the changes involve the loss of key employment conditions or a change in important employment conditions. 14 In relation to what appears under Question 3, the applicant submits that the December 2005 email conveys to academic and general staff that the terms of the AWAs being offered by UB have no impact or bearing on the security of employment of staff members who sign the AWA. The applicant submits that this representation is false and misleading, as the proposed AWAs will substantially diminish a number of EBA protections for employees in respect of how termination of employment or discipline may be affected. In short, the allegation is that the AWAs will make it easier for UB to terminate or discipline academic and general staff, thereby adversely affecting their security of employment. It is put that provisions in an industrial instrument which go to the method of termination of employment directly concern security of employment: see Re Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia; Ex parte Wooldumpers (Victoria) Limited [1989] HCA 10 ; (1989) 166 CLR 311 at 336 per Gaudron J. 15 Section 170WG(2) is concerned with 'knowingly' false or misleading statements. The applicant submits that this element of the alleged contraventions will be made out because Mr Walker was directly responsible for the negotiation of the EBA, and also had the conduct of the later unsuccessful attempts to introduce a replacement agreement on behalf of UB. As a result, Mr Walker had very detailed knowledge of the terms of the EBA, and the respects in which they differed from the proposed AWAs. In these circumstances, the applicant submits that there is a serious question to be tried that Mr Walker knew all of the essential matters which would go to make up the alleged contravention of s 170WG(2), whether or not Mr Walker perceived that the statements in the December 2005 email were false or misleading: see Yorke v Lucas (1985) 159 CLR 661 at 669 per Gibbs CJ; and King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd (2001) 184 ALR 98 at 104-106. 16 The applicant contends that the December 2005 statements amounted to continuing representations, which may influence staff members who are contemplating the making of an AWA with UB. Without conceding that there was anything false, misleading or inaccurate about the December 2005 statements, UB disputed the ongoing influence of those statements. UB relies upon an affidavit sworn by Mr Walker on 22 February 2006 which points out that a significant amount of additional information has been provided to staff members since 14 December 2005. 17 On 27 January 2006, UB modified the information on its web page concerning the AWAs. In particular, the section headed 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' was amended to include, inter alia , the following statements: ""5. Does the AWA change my employment status? The AWA is concerned with your terms and conditions of employment (just like a collective agreement). Your contract of employment determines whether you are employed on a full-time, part-time, continuing or fixed-term basis. Entering into an AWA does not affect this. So, for example, if your current employment status is as a continuing employee, that status will not change. 6. Will I be giving away key employment conditions if I sign an AWA? Important employment conditions in the current enterprise agreement remain in the general staff AWA. These include hours of work, span of hours, overtime, shift penalties, HDAs, superannuation, incremental progression, meal breaks, all leave entitlements, flexible work arrangements, 48/52 employment, public holidays, annual closedown, broadbanding, make-up pay, and salary packaging. Some of these conditions, for example, overtime, shift penalties and HDAs do not apply for academic staff and have not been included in the academic staff AWA. The current enterprise agreement was drafted 6 years ago and, obviously, provisions in that agreement and the AWAs are not identical. For example: &#8226; the dispute resolution procedure in the AWA is the model procedure prescribed by the Employment Advocate; &#8226; the AWA does not include appeals or review committees that review decisions made in cases of redundancy, unsatisfactory performance, misconduct and academic probation. The AWA does include a process for appeals in the case of termination of employment. If you have a concern about a particular entitlement that is important to you, you should raise that concern with Human Resources, who will explain any difference between the AWA and the enterprise agreement. ... 8. Will I have the right to return to the collective agreement when the AWA expires? After the AWA reaches its nominal expiry date it can be replaced by another AWA, or it can roll on in its present form until it is replaced, or it can be terminated according to the provisions in the AWA and/or the legislation. If you and the University agree, your AWA can be terminated at any time. What happens after an AWA is terminated depends on whether it is a pre-reform AWA , or an AWA made after the amendments to the Workplace Relations Act come into force (expected to be in March 2006). A pre-reform AWA is one that is made before the amended legislation comes into force. If you have a pre-reform AWA and it is terminated at any time, you will revert to the collective agreement that is in place at that time. An AWA that is made after the amended legislation comes into force (ie a post-reform AWA) can be terminated on 90 days notice by you, your bargaining agent (which might be the union), or the University after the AWA reaches its nominal expiry date. Until the terminated AWA is replaced by another AWA or a collective agreement made after the date of termination you will revert to the Fair Pay and Conditions Standards set by the Australian Fair Pay Commission, and to protected award conditions. In addition, the University may give an undertaking as to the terms and conditions of employment that will cover you if the University terminates the AWA after it expires."" 18 The applicant submitted that this information did not correct all of the misstatements in the December 2005 email, and it was simply posted on UB's web page. In contrast, the December 2005 statements were sent by email to all staff members. 19 Mr Walker deposes that information sessions concerning the proposed AWAs were held with academic and general staff in late December 2005 and in January and February 2006. At these sessions, Mr Walker says that he explained the workplace disputes clause and the differences between the procedure put in place by the AWA when compared with the EBA. In addition, Mr Walker deposes that if any staff member was misled by the December 2005 email, then the information sessions conducted by UB and the changes to the 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' web page would have made clear to them that a number of conditions of employment, including those relating to managing under-performance, discipline for misconduct and serious misconduct, redundancy and the resolution of workplace disputes would be altered by the AWA. 20 UB also relied upon an affidavit by Ms Penelope Faith Irish, a manager employed by UB in the area of accommodation services. She deposes that she signed an AWA after attending an information session with Mr Walker. She refers to differences between the EBA and the AWA in the area of redundancy entitlements, redundancy review processes, dispute resolution processes and the process to manage unsatisfactory performance and allegations of misconduct, but considered those issues to be peripheral and not important to her personally compared with other matters covered by the AWA. 21 UB also relies upon the fact that since 14 December 2005, the NTEU has provided extensive information to staff members drawing their attention to differences between the proposed AWAs and the EBA. In his submissions, Dr Jessup QC, senior counsel for UB, recognised that information published by the NTEU may not have the same authority or significance as correcting information that is published by UB. GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTIONS 22 The general principles governing the grant of interlocutory injunctions are well settled. The Court must be satisfied that there is both a serious question to be tried in the principal proceeding, and that the balance of convenience favours of the grant of an injunction: see Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Limited [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618; American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396; Australian Coarse Grain Pool Pty Ltd v Barley Marketing Board of Queensland (1983) 57 ALJR 425; Tableland Peanuts Pty Ltd v The Peanut Marketing Board (1984) 58 ALJR 283; Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1984) 3 FCR 55; and Patrick Stevedores Operations (No 2) Proprietary Limited v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 ("" Patrick Stevedores ""). These two questions are not considered in isolation from each other; the strength or weakness of the claim will have a bearing on what is required by way of balance of convenience: see Bullock v The Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia (No 1) (1985) 5 FCR 464 at 472. 23 The High Court has recently stressed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 ("" ABC "") that an interlocutory injunction is granted in aid of some legal or equitable right to final relief: see Gleeson CJ at 217 [11]-[12] and 218 [16]; Gaudron J at 232 [60]; and Gummow and Hayne JJ at 240-241 [88]-[91] and 248 [105]. Gummow and Hayne JJ said that the basic proposition where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought is that it is necessary to identify the legal (which may be statutory) or equitable rights which are to be determined at trial and in respect of which there is sought final relief which may or may not be injunctive in nature (at 241 [91]). I leave aside for the moment, as the High Court did, cases where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought in some special statutory jurisdiction, and cases where the integrity of the judicial process is protected by forms of relief such as the Mareva order or anti-suit injunctions. 24 The purpose ordinarily served by an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo. The way in which Gleeson CJ put it in ABC was that the justice and convenience of imposing an interim restraint, pending the hearing of the final action, if it exists, lies in the need to prevent the practical destruction of the right that is sought to be vindicated by the proceedings before there has been an opportunity to have its existence finally established (at 217 [12]). This formulation may not be apt in every case, but it draws attention to the fact that there must be an appropriate connection between the form of interim relief that is sought, the danger or damage that is sought to be averted by the interim relief, and the final relief which is claimed in the action. 25 The Court will also consider whether damages are an adequate remedy. This can be undertaken separately from an examination of the balance of convenience: see, for example, Castlemaine Tooheys Limited v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148. But it can also be undertaken as part of the assessment of the balance of convenience, and this is, perhaps, the more common approach. 26 One final and perhaps obvious point that bears repeating is that the Court does not embark on anything resembling a trial of the action when it deals with an application for interlocutory relief. Ordinarily, the Court will not attempt to reach any conclusion as to the facts or matters in dispute, beyond satisfying itself as to whether there is a serious question to be tried, or about other matters that may bear on the balance of convenience or discretionary considerations. SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE TRIED 27 On the material before me, I have concluded that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether the December 2005 email contained statements which were knowingly false or misleading, and which were made to staff members of UB with the intention of persuading them to make an AWA with UB. In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account the significant differences that exist between the EBA and the proposed AWAs, and evidence indicating that Mr Walker has a detailed knowledge of both instruments. 28 This conclusion, however, does not end the inquiry, as UB challenges the applicant's legal entitlement to relief on other grounds. Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant has not established that the interim relief he seeks is properly connected with any final relief to which the applicant has a legal or equitable right. In this context, Dr Jessup relies upon the width of the claims for interlocutory relief. Despite criticism of the terms of relief, the applicant did not seek to narrow the form of the interlocutory injunctions it seeks. As to the first order, Dr Jessup submitted that s 170WG(2) would not support an interim injunction restraining UB from taking any further step to enter into an AWA with a group member. This form of relief, he said, was not directed at restraining the making of, or containing or ameliorating the consequences of, allegedly misleading statements, and would go beyond the relief that could be granted at final trial. Dr Jessup criticised the second order on the grounds that it was expressed in broad and sweeping terms, and no Court would issue a restraining order in terms that UB must refrain from making false or misleading statements to group members. Such an order would do no more than replicate the general terms of s 170WG(2). Dr Jessup criticised the third injunctive order that was sought on the ground that a mandatory order requiring UB to correct the false or misleading statements in the December 2005 email would prejudge the outcome of the case. In my view, there is some force in these criticisms. 29 Next, Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant cannot seek an interim order preventing UB from making an AWA with him in circumstances where the applicant asserts that he has not been misled and will not in any event make an AWA. In Dr Jessup's submission, the applicant is not seeking an interlocutory remedy for himself, but is trying to do so for other members of the group. For those members of the group who have already made an AWA, and for those like the applicant who do not intend to make an AWA, it is difficult to say that the interlocutory relief that is being sought is in aid of final relief. The form of relief that is sought is arguably relevant only to those members of the group who have not yet made an AWA, but who may wish to do so. 30 An applicant in a representative proceeding must himself or herself have standing to sue a particular respondent: see Symington v Hoechst Schering Agrevo Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 164. There is no doubt that the question whether conduct challenged under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) was misleading or deceptive can warrant determination on a representative basis, notwithstanding the fact that inducement might be an element of each individuals cause of action: see King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [2000] FCA 1543 at [13] - [14] . The applicant submitted that a representative action can be brought seeking final declarations and final injunctions in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(2). 31 In Schanka v Employment National (Administration) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 202 ; (2000) 97 FCR 186, the Full Court (comprised of Ryan, Lee and Branson JJ) considered objections to standing in respect of a proceeding that alleged contravention of s 170WG(1) of the WR Act . The proceeding in question was a representative proceeding under Pt IVA of the FCA Act . The Full Court rejected an argument that a penalty could not be imposed under s 170VV in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(1) unless the conduct constituting the duress brought about the making of an AWA. The Full Court said that such a construction should be rejected because it would allow even the most reprehensible conduct engaged in by a party in relation to a proposed AWA to go unexamined by a Court if no concluded agreement were to come into existence. On its proper construction the WR Act supported a wider availability of the remedy afforded by s 170VV. In addressing this issue, the Full Court also considered whether the trial judge, Moore J, had erred in adding an individual, Mr James Burns, as an additional applicant. The alleged error was said to have arisen because Mr Burns had declined the offer of employment and so had never become a party to an AWA. The Full Court construed the reference in s 170VV(3) to 'a party to the AWA or ancillary document' so as to include a party to negotiations. 32 It follows therefore that an action for penalties and injunctive relied under ss 170VV and 170VZ can properly be constituted as a representative action: see Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1999] FCA 1250 ; (1999) 94 FCR 179. I also note that s 33C of the FCA Act provides that a representative proceeding may be commenced whether or not the relief sought is the same for each person represented. And I entirely accept the proposition that nothing in s 170VZ excludes this Court's powers under s 23 of the FCA Act to grant an interim or interlocutory injunction in an appropriate case: see Patrick Stevedores at 29 [27] per Brennan CJ; and Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1760 ; (2000) 104 FCR 80 at 103 [96] . Nonetheless, it may be a different question whether an applicant can bring an application for interlocutory relief in a representative proceeding, where the applicant has no individual entitlement to that relief, but the relief is sought on the basis that it may be relevant and necessary for other members of the group. 33 Dr Jessup's submissions may also raise issues about the identification of the group members. In this case, the application alleges that a common issue of law and fact arises, namely whether the December 2005 statements made on behalf of UB were knowingly false or misleading with the intention of persuading the academic and general staff to make the AWA, within the meaning of s 170WG(2) of the WR Act . In respect of these issues, the group may be composed of three different classes of members: first, those like the applicant, who have not signed the AWA and do not intend to do so; second, those who have not signed the AWA and who may wish to do so; and third those who have signed the AWA. The affected groups or sub-groups may need to be defined more precisely: ss 33Q and 33ZB of the FCA Act . 34 I have not had the benefit of full argument on any of the issues raised by these submissions. I do not propose to express from views about the submissions discussed in [28] to [29] above. In all the circumstances, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the applicant has demonstrated a serious question to be tried as to its entitlement to relief at trial. In view of the matters relied upon by Dr Jessup, however, I consider that the case that has been demonstrated by the applicant at this stage is towards the weaker end of the spectrum. As will appear it is unnecessary for me to be more definitive, as I have reached the conclusion that the application for interim relief should be refused on other grounds. BREACH OF AN IMPLIED TERM OF TRUST AND CONVENIENCE 35 The applicant's outline of written submissions contains an allegation that an implied term of trust and confidence should be implied into each group member's contract of employment with UB: see generally Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 144; Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 116 IR 186 ; and Heptonstall v Gaskin (No 2) (2005) 138 IR 103. The outline further alleges that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached this implied term by recklessly or knowingly making false or misleading statements to its staff members concerning the terms and conditions of employment which would apply to them if they entered into the proposed AWAs. 36 The application by which these proceedings was instituted does not contain any reference to these allegations. Nor is it mentioned in any of the affidavits that were filed by the applicant in support of its application for interlocutory relief. The first notice that UB had of these allegations came when the applicant's counsel handed up the outline of written submissions at the commencement of the interlocutory hearing. In these circumstances, Dr Jessup said that he did not intend to address any submissions to these allegations. 37 I am not satisfied at this stage that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached any such implied contractual term. The basic case that has been put is simply that Mr Walker made statements that were false and misleading in circumstances which gave rise to a contravention of s 170WG(2). 38 In view of the lack of notice of these allegations to the respondent, and the lack of evidence directed to the breach of the alleged implied term, I do not propose to discuss these allegations any further. I note as well that the applicant hardly addressed any submissions to the alleged breach of implied term. BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 39 The grant of an interlocutory injunction is discretionary. In exercising that discretion, the Court will closely examine the balance of convenience. This involves weighing up the extent of any impending prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant if injunctive relief is not granted pending trial, and weighing that against the extent of any hardship that the grant of the injunction may cause the respondent. It also needs to be borne in mind that the purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo, and that the interlocutory injunction is granted so as to preserve or protect the legal or equitable rights that are sought to be vindicated in the proceedings. One relevant inquiry for the Court will be whether irreparable injury which is not compensable in damages will result if relief is not granted. 40 The applicant submits that irreparable harm will occur if injunctive relief is not granted. He submits that the Court is not empowered to revoke an AWA even if it is made in reliance on false or misleading statements made in contravention of s 170WG(2). This is said to follow from the fact that an AWA, once filed, takes on a statutory character. Section 170VM sets out the circumstances when an AWA may be terminated, and the applicant points out that none of them apply to the present circumstances. Further, the applicant submits that the Court is not empowered to make an order for damages in respect of any loss suffered in consequence of a breach of s 170WG(2). UB also submitted that the Court is not empowered to set aside an AWA after it has been filed, and takes on a statutory character. 41 The applicant's case for interlocutory relief was based on the premise that the December 2005 statements were continuing to operate, and might mislead staff members into making an AWA between the time of the hearing and the determination of the proceeding. The interim relief is not relevant to those members of the group who have already made AWAs, or those members of the group who, like the applicant, possess full information and do not intend to make an AWA. 42 In my opinion, the legitimate purpose of an interlocutory injunction at this point, pending trial, is to eliminate or mitigate the risk that staff members of UB might be misled by the December 2005 statements into making an AWA if no relief is granted. 43 The starting point, therefore, is to consider what relief, if any, is just, convenient or necessary at this point to address the risk that the December 2005 statements are continuing to operate and may influence staff members to enter into an AWA with UB. 44 UB has submitted that the continuing influence of the December 2005 statements is likely to be minor, if they have any continuing effect at all. UB submits that the academic community at UB is generally well informed about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWAs. Moreover, UB submits that the December 2005 statements have been overtaken by a substantial amount of subsequent information. While there is some force in these submissions, there must remain a risk that the December 2005 statements may have some ongoing influence on some staff members. 45 UB has submitted that any case which might otherwise have existed for the grant of interim relief is met by UB's preparedness to offer an undertaking to the Court. A form of undertaking was provided to me during the course of the hearing. In essence, the undertaking is to the effect that UB will make a further extensive clarification statement to all staff members identifying the differences between the proposed AWA and the EBA. Further, UB said that it would undertake to refrain from entering into AWAs with its staff members until the expiry of a period of seven days after the publication of the new information to its staff members. By this means, UB submitted that any risk that staff members might enter into an AWA on the basis of misleading or false statements would be removed. 46 At the time of the hearing of the interlocutory application, the applicant and his counsel had not had a full opportunity of considering the terms of the proposed undertakings. I directed that the parties consult with each other about the terms of the proposed undertakings. I further directed that UB submit a final form of the proposed undertakings after a process of consultation had taken place. UB has now submitted a final form of the proposed undertakings. I have been informed that the parties have agreed upon the terms of the clarification statement, but no agreement was reached about other aspects of the proposed undertakings. I shall not set the proposed undertakings in these reasons, as they are recorded in the orders which I propose to make. 47 In my opinion, the undertakings proposed by UB are a complete answer to the application for interim relief. The proposed undertakings remove any real risk that staff members will be induced to enter into AWAs between the date of my order and the date of trial as a result of the allegedly misleading statements that were made in December 2005. 48 In the light of the undertakings proffered by UB, I consider that the hardship that would be occasioned by the grant of wide interlocutory injunctions of the kind sought by the applicant outweighs any prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant and other group members that would be occasioned by withholding relief. The undertakings afford the best means of preserving the status quo pending trial, and address the risk that the December 2005 statements may have a continuing influence on staff members. In short, the undertakings produce an outcome that is both just and convenient. 49 A number of other factors support the conclusion that it is neither just nor convenient to grant the interlocutory relief sought by the applicant. Some of them are discretionary factors. 50 First, the relief sought by the applicant is cast in extremely wide terms and arguably goes beyond relief that could be legitimately sought in this proceeding. 51 Secondly, the relief sought by the applicant would seriously impinge upon the rights of third parties. An injunction restraining UB from entering into an AWA with its staff members pending the trial of this action would seriously affect the rights of those staff members, including their entitlement to back-pay. The applicant submits that the risk that such employees would lose their entitlement to back-pay if AWAs cannot be concluded by 31 March 2006 is an arbitrary limitation that was imposed by UB, and it can be varied at UB's discretion. I will assume that this is so. Nonetheless, it is relevant to the exercise of my discretion that the form of relief that has been sought will significantly affect the rights of other staff members. Their rights will be affected if the injunction were to go, whether or not the employees have fully informed themselves about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWA. Employees may be so affected even if they opt out of the represented group. If there is another alternative that protects staff members from the risk that they will be misled by the December 2005 statements, such as that offered by the undertakings, it is a relevant consideration that the more drastic alternative proposed by the applicant will affect the rights of third parties. 52 The applicant submits that the position of third parties will be protected by its undertaking as to damages. The usual form of undertaking in this Court extends beyond the damages which may be suffered by the respondent consequent upon the interlocutory order, and includes damages that may be suffered by other persons. In this case, the applicant has proffered his own undertaking jointly with an undertaking by the NTEU. I accept that a joint undertaking as to damages by the applicant and the NTEU is one of substance. However, I do not consider that the availability of the undertaking can justify the making of an interim order that will seriously affect third party rights, in circumstances where there is another alternative that is both just and convenient and which will not adversely affect third party rights. 53 In this case, I would not discount the significance of the impact on third party rights in the way that Finkelstein J did in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2000) 106 IR 139 at [57]. CONCLUSION 54 For the foregoing reasons, I propose to dismiss the application for interlocutory relief. I do so upon the basis of the undertakings proffered to the Court by UB. I certify that the preceding fifty-four (54) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young. Associate: Dated: 24 February 2006 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr K. Farouque Solicitors for the Applicant: Maurice Blackburn Cashman Counsel for the Respondent: Dr C. Jessup QC and Mr C. O'Grady Solicitors for the Respondent: Phillips Fox Date of Hearing: 22 February 2006 Date of Judgment: 24 February 2006 CLARIFICATION STATEMENT - ACADEMIC STAFF Set out below is a statement by the University of Ballarat ( University ) to all staff."
Case12495,referred to,Bropho v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Anor (2004) 135 CLR 105,"The question as to the reasonableness or otherwise of conduct for the purposes of s 18D was explained by a Full Federal Court in Bropho v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Anor (2004) 135 CLR 105 comprising French, Lee and Carr JJ. My attention was drawn by counsel for the applicant to the following passages in the reasons for decision, being pars [80]-[82], [96] and [102] in the reasons for judgment of French J, [141] and [144] in the reasons of Lee J and [178] in the reasons of Carr J. I would draw attention in particular to the formulation of the reasonableness requirement addressed by French J in those passages in his reasons, and in particular the following in [80]-[81] concerning 'the public interest': '80. An Act will be done reasonably in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work if it is done for the purpose and in a manner calculated to advance the purpose of the artistic expression in question. An act is done reasonably in relation to statements, publications, discussions or debates for genuine academic, artistic or scientific purposes, if it bears a rational relationship to those purposes. The publication of a genuine scientific paper on the topic of genetic differences between particular human populations might, for one reason or another, be insulting or offensive to a group of people. Its discussion at a scientific conference would no doubt be reasonable. Its presentation to a meeting convened by a racist organisation and its use to support a view that a particular group of persons is morally or otherwise ""inferior"" to another by reason of their race or ethnicity, may not be a thing reasonably done in relation to para (b) of s 18D. 81. The same kind of criterion may be applied to acts done in reports or comments on events or matters of public interest. A presentation of a report or comment which highlights, in a way that is gratuitously insulting or offensive, a matter that is irrelevant to the purported question of public interest under discussion may not be done ""reasonably"". A feature article on criminal activity said to be associated with a particular ethnic group would in the ordinary course be expected to fall within the protection of para (c). If it were written in a way that offered gratuitous insults by, for example, referring to members of the group in derogatory racist slang terms, then it would be unlikely that the comment would be offered ""reasonably"".' The second respondent Mr Grigor-Scott made the following assertion in his submission document bearing date 25 September 2005 ( ante ): 'Everything that has been said or done by the respondents, or either of them, about which complaint has been made in this matter, has been said or done reasonably and in good faith for the purpose of making a fair and accurate report of events or [sic] matters of public interest or had been the expression of a genuine belief about such events or matters held by the person making the comment'. 49 As to the statutory notion of 'good faith', I would draw attention to what was said by French J at [96] and [102] on that subject in his majority judgment: '96. It follows from the preceding discussion that good faith may be tested both subjectively and objectively. Want of subjective good faith, ie, seeking consciously to further an ulterior purpose of racial vilification may be sufficient to forfeit the protection of s 18D. But good faith requires more than subjective honesty and legitimate purposes. It requires, under the aegis of fidelity or loyalty to the relevant principles in the Act, a conscientious approach to the task of honouring the values asserted by the Act. This may be assessed objectively. 102. A person acting in the exercise of a protected freedom of speech or expression under 18D will act in good faith if he or she is subjectively honest, and objectively viewed, has taken a conscientious approach to advancing the exercising of that freedom in a way that is designed to minimise the offence or insult, humiliation or intimidation suffered by people affected by it. That is one way, not necessarily the only way, of acting in good faith for the purpose of s 18D. On the other hand, a person who exercises the freedom carelessly disregarding or willfully blind to its effect upon people who will be hurt by it or in such a way as to enhance that hurt may be found not to have been acting in good faith.' 50 What was next submitted to the Court on the occasion of Mr Grigor-Scott's attempted re-opening of the evidence in the case was a large bundle of documents. That course of re-opening was opposed by counsel for the applicant upon the basis that Mr Grigor-Scott's affidavits of 7 September 2006 and 11 October 2006 were in any event of no relevance to the defence by the respondents of the proceedings, and otherwise to any issue in the proceedings relevantly to the statutory scheme. Moreover it was emphasised that the respondents had already passed up ample opportunity to present any such material to the extent that it was relevant, and in any event, no relevance to the issues properly arising had been demonstrated by Mr Grigor-Scott. 51 By way of rejoinder, Mr Grigor-Scott pointed broadly to what appeared on the BBC's website and 'to ... what I have got on the computer here', that being however a response of no utility, much less an explanation as to how any specific instance of his website documentation bore upon the issues arising, or for what reason. It is convenient at this point that my impression was that Mr Grigor-Scott's purported unspecific tender of vast numbers of unidentified documents might operate to draw out the current proceedings indefinitely. Moreover Mr Grigor-Scott continued to repeat in the course of his purported address to the Court vaguely or at best broadly expressed criticisms of the applicant's case of obviously no assistance, such as that '[t]here were a whole series of implausible submissions ...', that 'they have no case', that there was 'no evidence of breach of the statute', that 'the applicant is misusing the Act in order to promote the objectives of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith', that 'my church has done nothing wrong', and that the applicant's case was 'untruthful'. 61 I have recorded in some detail Mr Grigor-Scott's assertions and submissions, advanced as they were from the Bar Table and which were contained in written material which he sought to tender, inclusively of his short purported written submissions dated 25 September 2006. He maintained to the Court that all that he had done in the course of the proceedings the subject of complaint was undertaken ' .... to determine reasonableness and good faith', in line with the operation of s 18D of the RD Act upon which he repeatedly claimed reliance. I should further record additionally that on the concluding day's hearing, I rejected the admissibility of the remaining evidence of 7 September 2006 and 11 October 2006, which he sought to tender into evidence, as 'oppressive and irrelevant', though I nevertheless agreed to treat his relatively short two and a half page 'submission' of 25 September 2006 as having been placed before the Court for consideration. By that document, Mr Grigor-Scott asserted reliance upon what appeared in the judgments of the Full Federal Court in Bropho [2004] FCAFC 16 ; (2004) 135 FCR 105, and specifically at [79] and [101]-[102] in the case of French J and [178] in the case of Carr J, though I am unable to discern how those passages conceivably assisted his case. 62 As foreshadowed, counsel for the applicant placed reliance upon what appeared in the reasons for judgment in Bropho [2004] FCAFC 16 ; 135 FCR 105 of French J at [96] and [102], of Lee J (dissenting) at [141], and of Carr J at [178], and contrary to the submission of Mr Grigor-Scott, counsel for the applicant explained further by supplementary outline of written submissions the basis for his invocation of those principles enunciated in Bropho [2004] FCAFC 16 ; 135 FCR 105 which he thereupon cited. Those principles related to the statutory tests as to ' reasonableness', 'public interest' and 'good faith' , in relation to which tests it was submitted by counsel that Mr Grigor-Scott's case fell well short, being a submission which in my opinion, in the light of the matters I have recorded in these reason, was clearly correct. Mr Grigor-Scott's purported invocation of s 18D was made incidentally by way of a so-called written 'submission', and not by way of formal application for relief in the form prescribed by the Federal Court Rules . 63 I should record for completeness that Mr Grigor-Scott sought to contend in his belated 25 September 2006 document that '[t]he matters about which the complaints in this matter have been made do not relate to every ""Jew"", but are part of an academic or public interest discussion in relation to ""Zionist"" policies and practices'. I have not been able to identify, much less rationalise however, the existence of any such discussion in the context of the present proceedings and of the conduct complained of by the applicant which has led thereto. I agree with the response of counsel for the applicant that the submission is misconceived in its purported aspects. 64 I should acknowledge that by letter bearing date 1 August 2006 written very belatedly by Mr Grigor-Scott, there was sent, without prior approval of a direction or otherwise of the Court, a comprehensive five page closely typed letter. This document bore implicitly the fact of a likely receipt by him of legal assistance, by at least the latter stage of the proceedings. It included what may be described as an unfortunate hotchpot of repetition, abuse of the applicant's case, misstatements, and otherwise irrelevant material that constituted no sufficient basis for specific consideration in the course of these reasons."
Case8722,cited,Kumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No. 2) [2004] FCA 18,"I accept that such orders should be made only in the rarest of circumstances where serious lapses of proper conduct have occurred for such an order to be justified. Like Mansfield J in Kumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No. 2) [2004] FCA 18 , I am conscious of the fact (and think it is quite a significant matter) that the moment a personal costs order is made against a lawyer, a problem of conflict immediately arises between the lawyer and his client. Such conflicts do not assist the administration of justice. It therefore seems to me that it is not generally appropriate, except in a serious case and even then only when an application is made by a party, that consideration should be given to the imposing of a personal costs order. I am not, of course, saying that it is not open to the court to impose a personal costs order of its own motion. However, the Federal Magistrate did not proceed in this case to impose any personal costs order and so no consequence arises in that regard. It seems to me, having read carefully the material and having listened to the recording, that in the way in which the Federal Magistrate dealt with the matter, even if she might have desisted from raising the matter unless an application had been made, her conduct fell a very long way short of anything that could amount to actual or apprehended bias. 13 The appellant did raise some other matters specifically on the issue of bias. I have given consideration to all of those matters and again I think that they have no substance. One particular matter was the fact that, apparently, the Federal Magistrate had read the first of the decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal, rather than the second decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, prior to the hearing and understood that that first decision was the decision under review. I have read the parts of the transcript relating to that matter and it seems to me that, again, it does not give rise to any claim of bias."
Case14759,cited,Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476,"In the events which have happened there is no effective dispute between the parties that the requirement of s 19(1)(b) did not exist so much is decided by the relief granted by Rares J. Although there is strictly no estoppel, because the parties are different, counsel for the respondent concedes that I would follow Rares J and that the result would be that the existence of the two successive s 16 notices that were issued prior to the hearing before the magistrate is swept away ( Minister for Immigration v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597; Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ).

Case23765,related,SZGSR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 882,"is an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from a decision of Emmett FM, who had dismissed an application for relief in relation to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal affirming a decision not to grant a protection visa to the present applicant ( SZGSR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 882). The first matter to be dealt with is the explanation for delay in appealing. The explanation which is given is that the applicant had lost a key to a post box and thus did not receive the copy of the reasons for judgment, although he had been present when judgment was handed down. That is hardly a satisfactory explanation for delay. The second issue is whether or not there is, in any event, an arguable ground of appeal. The only ground in the draft notice of appeal is that the applicant claims he was deprived of receiving procedural fairness as the Tribunal was influenced by the contradictory information and that the 'Honourable trial judge erred in considering this issue'. That, of course, isolates no ground in any real sense. In what he has said to me today, the only matter of substance that he puts forward is that the learned federal magistrate did not accept the facts as he presented them in relation to his claims which were rejected by the Tribunal."

While counsel for the Commissioner accepts that a question whether a finding was based on no evidence would be a question of law, the present case has to be considered in light of the onus of proof imposed on the taxpayer by s 14ZZK(b)(i) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth). The appellant has to prove not only a case of error, but what the correct assessment was: Trautwein v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1936] HCA 77 ; (1936) 56 CLR 63 at 88, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco [1990] HCA 3 ; (1990) 168 CLR 614 at 623. Questions as to what were the true amount of the appellant's gross income and purchases in the 1997 year were questions of fact. For the reasons explained by the Tribunal, the appellant did not establish any different figures from those assessed by the Commissioner on the basis of the appellant's own financial records, such as they were."
Case1626,considered,NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10,It is apparent from the applicant's oral submissions that she seeks an impermissible merits review of the Tribunal decision: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Another v Peko-Wallsend Limited and Others [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40-42; Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 391-392; NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] .

She married her husband in 1988, and they had a child together in 1991, a daughter. Her husband wished to have a son, however, and she became pregnant again in 2002. Because a second birth was not permitted pursuant to the one-child policy, she had to hide in the homes of others to avoid officials. She said that she had been discovered in her seventh month of pregnancy by birth control officials and was detained and forced to have an abortion. Thereafter, she said that her house had been confiscated, that she had lost her employment, and, as a consequence of the forced abortion, her husband divorced her in 2003. She also claimed that the electricity and water supply were cut off to her home."

Case16812,cited,CFMEU v Queensland Coal and Oil Shale Mining Industry (Superannuation) Ltd [2003] FCA 1174,"In my view the following points are relevant in considering the issue of costs: &#8226; first, the policy of the Act with respect to costs as articulated in s 85A is that parties should bear their own costs unless there are such circumstances as specified in s 85A(2): De Rose [2005] FCAFC 137. Logically, it follows that this policy is equally applicable to non-parties - such as the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant - who incur costs in respect of litigation under the Act &#8226; second, the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant requested at the directions hearing of 9 March 2007 that it be served with such material as the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant should file and serve on the respondents to the Kabi Kabi #3 Application, and that it should be entitled to be heard at the hearing on 3 May 2007. In my view the position of the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant is analogous to that of an intervener in this case, and I note that as a general rule the Court tends not to apply conventional rules as to recovery of costs to interveners: Wilcox J in CFMEU v Queensland Coal and Oil Shale Mining Industry (Superannuation) Ltd [2003] FCA 1174 at [11] - [12] &#8226; third, as Mr Topp submitted, the directions made on 9 March 2007 did not require or otherwise oblige the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to file affidavits, outlines of argument or any other material, nor to do anything else at all. Indeed, the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant is not a party to the proceedings. While the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant has an interest in the proceedings for obvious reasons, I can identify no requirement of reason or justice which entitles the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to recover its costs against the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant with respect to preparation of material for the hearing of the 29 June 2006 notice of motion &#8226; in these circumstances, and taking into account the principle that an order for payment of costs in favour of a non-party will be exceptional and therefore must be treated with considerable caution, in my view it is not appropriate to order the costs sought by the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to be paid by the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant."

Case16177,cited,Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (No 1) [1988] FCA 40 ; (1988) 39 FCR 546,"Silence may be relied upon in order to show a breach of s 52 when the circumstances give rise to an obligation to disclose relevant facts ( Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (No 1) [1988] FCA 40 ; (1988) 39 FCR 546 at 557 and see the useful discussion in Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act (29th ed) 1.52.53). If the circumstances do give rise to such an obligation, the next question is whether the relevant silence constituted conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive ( Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 477 at 489, 504, 508). The duty to disclose is not confined to cases where there are particular relationships, such as trustee and beneficiary or solicitor and client ( Henjo Investments Pty Ltd [1988] FCA 40 ; 39 FCR 546 at 557). However the applicant bears the onus of establishing how or in what manner that which was left unsaid had the potential to mislead or deceive. To have that potential, omissions in communicating information must be relevant to the topic about which it is said a respondent's conduct is likely to mislead or deceive and material in the circumstances ( Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd (1995) 55 FCR 452 at 467-468). 602 In any event, while Mr Perry SC in cross-examination of Mr Bailey made much of the fact that Mr Bailey's report replicated the historical production figures found in the 1 June 2004 Valuation Report, this replication was in no way directed by the respondents. The fact of duplication of the material was, if anything, an issue between Mr Tracy and Mr Bailey. Mr Tracy organised his own valuation report for his own purposes, by a valuer whose valuation of the relevant properties was, in the end result, very different from that of Mr Neubecker and indeed reflected the price which Mr Tracy had offered to pay. Notwithstanding the fact that the historical production data in the two reports was substantially identical, in my view this does not mean that, in the chain of causation, any original influence on the applicants exerted by the 1 June 2004 Valuation Report in relation to this data remained (contrast, for example, Henjo Investments Pty Ltd (No 1) [1988] FCA 40 ; 39 FCR 546). Indeed as the evidence also demonstrates, Mr Tracy clearly took into account Mr Bailey's report in his decision to purchase the relevant properties (Tracy statement sworn 17 November 2006 at [77], [78]). 603 In para 20B Further Amended Statement of Claim the applicants pleaded as follows: Each of the Second and Third Respondents is a person who: a) has aided, abetted, counselled or procured; or b) has been knowingly concerned and/or a party to the contravention by the First Respondent of section 51A and 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 as alleged in paragraph 20A. 604 There is no case against either Mr Strahley or Mr Breed in relation to s 53A."

Case23733,distinguished,Ismail v Richards Butler (a firm) [1996] QB 711,"Ismail v Richards Butler (a firm) [1996] QB 711 ("" Ismail ""), Moore-Bick J varied an order made by a master that there be production subject to the client paying &#163;150,000 to the solicitors and &#163;310,000 into Court by requiring instead that the client provide security for &#163;450,000. The case for an exception to the general rule was not as strong as the case of A v B because there was not on the material before the Court sufficient to enable the judge to decide whether at the conclusion the solicitor would be held entitled to recover the full amount of his claim, or indeed any particular amount. Nevertheless, security was appropriate and Moore-Bick J said (at 731): ""However, when I consider the other aspects of this case I do think that some departure from the normal practice is called for in the interests of justice. I can see no basis for criticising Richards Butler's conduct in this matter, and such indications as there are suggest that in some respects the plaintiffs' attitude may owe more to negotiating tactics than to a real sense of grievance. I accept that the plaintiffs require the immediate delivery of the papers in the three matters mentioned in their summons which remain fully live, but if Richards Butler are required to hand over the papers on the usual terms their lien is likely to prove of little value when the papers are returned to them. It has not been suggested, on the other hand, that the plaintiffs are likely to suffer any real hardship if they are required to provide security of another kind other than the general effect on their cashflow of having to fund a payment into court. That is a difficulty which can probably be largely overcome by providing security in some other recognised form. Taking all these matters into account I am satisfied that the interests of justice in this case require that the plaintiffs provide some security for Richards Butler's claim."" It seems to me that the effect of the authorities is that the general rule is that, where the solicitor terminates the retainer, an order for production will be made. There may be exceptional circumstances which lead to a modification of the general rule. The modification of the general rule will, generally speaking, involve the imposition of terms, such as part payment or payment into court or the provision of security. In an extreme case like A v B , where the factors identified in [44] are present, that may lead to a refusal of an order for production. However, generally speaking, the presence of exceptional circumstances will lead to the imposition of terms. That to my mind is the effect of the decision in Gamlen and, I think the decision of Moore-Bick J in Ismail is consistent with that conclusion. In Ismail , Moore-Bick J said (at 731) that he could see no basis for criticising the conduct of the solicitors and that there was evidence to suggest that the client's attitude owed more to negotiating tactics than a real sense of grievance. It seems to me that this case is clearly distinguishable from the case before Leggatt J in A v B . It is also distinguishable from Ismail because I cannot say that the cross-claimants do not have a real sense of grievance or indeed a substantial cause of action against the cross-respondent. It seems to me that this case is analogous to the decision in Gamlen . It presents the same problem identified by Goff LJ (see [41] above) in that there may prove to be nothing in the cross-claimants' allegations against the cross-respondent, but it is simply not possible to say that at this stage. They are substantial, they arise directly out of the applicants' claim and they are the subject of a cross-claim."
Case24896,considered,SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 390,"In some circumstances a departure by a reconstituted Tribunal from the findings and conclusions of an earlier Tribunal may constitute a denial of procedural fairness and a denial of the opportunity "" to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review "", as required by s 425(1): eg SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 390. But such is not the present case. The Tribunal's reasons thus contain the following passage: The Tribunal again told the applicant that it had listened to the tapes of his two previous hearings with the first and second Tribunal and that this Tribunal may take into account what he had told previous Tribunals. The Tribunal asked the applicant if he wanted to change or add to anything he had previously said. The applicant stated that he did not. The Tribunal put to the applicant that it was still concerned about why Shouters would ask the applicant, who is not a member of the Shouters, to burn CDs when this task could have been done on a personal computer, in secret. The applicant stated that all he knows is that none of the Shouters do this kind of thing and that perhaps they came to him because he was a good friend of Mr [X] and because he had no religious beliefs and so would not attract the PSB. These were the factual issues later resolved against the now Appellant by the Tribunal. No breach of s 425 can be discerned. The now Appellant was given every opportunity "" to persuade "" the Tribunal on each of the issues resolved against him. 22 The final Ground seeks to contend that the Federal Magistrates Court failed to consider the application "" properly and fairly "". That Ground is without substance. 23 The appeal must be dismissed with costs."
Case13134,cited,Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Proprietary Limited [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589,"rule as to res judicata comes into operation whenever a party attempts in a second proceeding to litigate a cause of action which has merged into judgment in a prior proceeding (per Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aickin JJ in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Proprietary Limited [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 ('Anshun') at 597). In Anshun Brennan J, as his Honour then was, said at 610-612: 'Imprecision in the meaning of cause of action tends to uncertainty in defining the ambit of the rule that a judgment bars subsequent proceedings between the same parties on the same cause of action. The foundation of the rule, whether it be termed res judicata, or cause of action estoppel or judgment recovered, is the merging of the cause of action in the judgment. In reference to res judicata, Dixon J said in Blair v Curran : ""the very right or cause of action claimed or put in suit has ... passed into judgment, so that it is merged and has no longer an independent existence ..."" If cause of action is taken to mean a right, the rule is stated in terms of the passing of the right into judgment, and the rule precludes a party bound by the judgment from maintaining against another party bound by it any subsequent proceeding to recover a judgment giving a remedy to enforce or to compensate for an infringement of that right. The rule does not preclude litigation seeking a remedy to which a party is entitled in virtue of a different right from that which was first put in suit provided that the facts which support the right sued upon in the second action are not the same facts as those supporting the right which passed into the first judgment ... If cause of action is taken to mean the facts which support a right to judgment, the rule of res judicata bars an action for relief founded upon the same facts as those upon which an earlier judgment was recovered, though the right sued upon in the second action is different from the right which passed into or was negated by the earlier judgment. .... When the same facts support rights to different remedies against the same defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover a judgment giving a remedy in respect of more than one right ... He may pursue his remedies concurrently in the same action, but he is put to his election before judgment as to which remedy he shall have. And when judgment is entered, all of the rights which he might have claimed in that litigation are merged in the judgment. ... The party entitled to relief cannot improve his position by bringing separate actions. Though he may elect between inconsistent remedies pursued in the one action, or between the actions to be pursued in order to recover a judgment giving the remedy he chooses, the merger in the judgment first recovered of a right to another remedy takes effect by operation of law. When those rights (or causes of action) are extinguished, no further litigation may be pursued to recover a second judgment upon them.' (footnotes omitted)"

Each of the limitations upon the power conferred by these provisions only assumes additional importance when it is recalled that a search warrant may be issued and executed in respect to premises occupied by persons other than those involved or suspected of being involved in criminal activity. Where the terms of s 3E are satisfied, a warrant may thus be issued in respect to premises occupied by persons unconnected with any crime. The fundamental interference with privacy which is authorised by a search warrant must be constantly borne in mind. Search warrants are "" ... intrusions into the sanctity of a person's domain and concomitantly an interference with his privacy ...

[I]t is worth collecting the reasons which obliged his Honour to provide more than the findings offered in this case. They included: (1) The fact that the High Court had returned the cause to the Compensation Court specifically to permit the ordinary procedures of the law to be followed. These include proper fact finding at first instance. Only if this course is followed will appellate courts be saved the time otherwise taken in determining the facts, isolating the issues, removing issues not seriously in contention and addressing those which are; (2) The judicial reasons at first instance are of benefit not only to the parties and their advisers, but also to the appellate court. The analysis of issues by one legally trained mind will often help others to cut through the issues on appeal to those which are most important. This is especially true in a case where multiple issues are raised, as in this case; (3) It may be possible to conceive an instance where the incorporation of submissions by one party in reasons for judgment would be an adequate compliance with the judicial duty to provide reasons. That was certainly not the case here. ...

It would cease to be defeasible only when the half interest ceased to be part of Helen's Fund and subject to the Trustees' power of sale. 66 Helen was not entitled to the half interest once it was subjected to the Trust. Her only entitlement was to require the Trustees to pay her money once the conditions of her entitlement were satisfied. 67 Clause 5.4 of the Deed provided relevantly, as follows: Fund Subject to Relevant Requirements This Deed shall be read and construed on the basis that the provisions of the Relevant Requirements are incorporated in the Deed to the extent that they impose covenants or obligations on the Trustee in order for the Fund to qualify for concessional Taxation treatment and this Deed shall be further read and construed on the basis that where there is any inconsistency between a provision in this Deed and a provision under the Relevant Requirements the latter shall prevail...

Case13941,considered,SZEOP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 807,"After the foregoing reasons had been prepared counsel for the appellant sought and obtained leave to file further written submissions because of the publication of reasons in two other cases.

Written submissions in reply were also filed by counsel for the Minister pursuant to leave. 27 In SZEOP the central issue was whether the Tribunal had satisfied its obligations under s 424A(1) of the Act . The Tribunal had determined that the appellant's delay in making a claim for a protection visa once he had arrived in Australia was a reason for concluding that he had fabricated a claim to being homosexual. The Tribunal had sent a letter to the appellant under s 424A(1) in which it invited comment on the proposition that: ""Your delay in applying for Australia's protection is relevant because it casts doubt on the genuineness, or at least the depth, for your claimed fear of being persecuted if you return to Bangladesh."" Rares J held that this invitation was insufficiently precise: it ""did not include any suggestion that the appellant's claim to be a homosexual would be positively disbelieved as a fabrication because he had delayed in making his protection visa application"": at [35]. There is nothing in his Honour's reasons which causes me to depart from my conclusion that the Tribunal, in the present case, failed to meet its obligations to the appellant under s 424A(1). Indeed, his Honour's reemphasis of the need for sufficient specificity in s 424A letters in entirely consistent with the views which I have expressed."

It is fair to say that that approach has not been generally supported in the authorities. Rather than commence the assessment by determining an overall penalty and then distributing the amount of that penalty amongst the various contraventions either arithmetically or by reference to a weighted distribution, the better approach to the application of the totality principle involves an assessment of a penalty appropriate to each contravention and then a final overall assessment of the sum of the penalties to consider whether the aggregate is ""just and appropriate"". This approach is consistent with Mill v The Queen (supra) and has been applied by Goldberg J in ACCC v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd ; Jessup J in Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions; Jessup J in Williams v CFMEU (No. 2) [2009] FCA 548 and Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick (supra).

For present purposes, however, it may be accepted that the elements of the modern law of passing off were summarised in Erven Warnink BV v J Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd [1979] AC 731 at 742 by Diplock LJ as follows: My Lords, A. G. Spalding &amp; Bros. v. A. W. Gamage Ltd., 84 L.J.Ch. 449 and the later cases make it possible to identify five characteristics which must be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing off: (1) a misrepresentation (2) made by a trader in the course of trade, (3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence) and (5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will probably do so. His Lordship continued: In seeking to formulate general propositions of English law, however, one must be particularly careful to beware of the logical fallacy of the undistributed middle. It does not follow that because all passing off actions can be shown to present these characteristics, all factual situations which present these characteristics give rise to a cause of action for passing off. True it is that their presence indicates what a moral code would censure as dishonest trading, based as it is upon deception of customers and consumers of a trader's wares but in an economic system which has relied on competition to keep down prices and to improve products there may be practical reasons why it should have been the policy of the common law not to run the risk of hampering competition by providing civil remedies to every one competing in the market who has suffered damage to his business or goodwill in consequence of inaccurate statements of whatever kind that may be made by rival traders about their own wares. The market in which the action for passing off originated was no place for the mealy mouthed; advertisements are not on affidavit; exaggerated claims by a trader about the quality of his wares, assertions that they are better than those of his rivals even though he knows this to be untrue, have been permitted by the common law as venial ""puffing"" which gives no cause of action to a competitor even though he can show that he has suffered actual damage in his business as a result. Lord Fraser of Tullybelton expressed perhaps a narrower statement of the cause of action: [1979] AC at 755 to 756. Lord Diplock's statement as to the five "" characteristics "" of the cause of action for passing off has been adopted in Australia: Moorgate Tobacco (1984) 156 CLR at 443 to 444 per Deane J; ConAgra (1972) 33 FCR at 308 to 309 per Lockhart J; Osgaig [2004] FCA 1394 at [83] to [85], 213 ALR at 167 to 168 per Weinberg J; Ward Group Pty Ltd v Brodie &amp; Stone plc [2005] FCA 471 at [29] to [30] [2005] FCA 471 ; , 143 FCR 479 at 487 per Merkel J.

The Minister submitted that the sole basis on which the applicants say the Tribunal was required to consider this possibility was that the first applicant had told the Tribunal he did not want to return to Fiji because his 'wife and daughters might be the victims of violence' (at 5 of the Tribunal's reasons). The Minister contended that the context in which this statement appears does not support the applicant's claims that they advanced the argument to the Tribunal that 'Indo-Fijian (young) females' comprised a particular social group in Fiji. In Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 , Gleeson CJ stated at [1]: ' ... this Court has insisted that, on judicial review, a decision of the Tribunal must be considered in the light of the basis upon which the application was made, not upon an entirely different basis which may occur to an applicant, or an applicant's lawyers, at some later stage in the process.' 24 In these circumstances, this ground cannot be sustained. 25 The second ground of appeal asserts that the Tribunal erred in failing to consider an integer of the claims, namely, whether the applicants had a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of the first applicant's support for the Fiji Labour Party at the time of the general election. The first applicant argued in his submissions that the Tribunal addressed the wrong issue in stating that 'I am satisfied from the independent evidence that the party is unlikely to achieve power again in the reasonably foreseeable future' at 17. However, the Tribunal went on to find in the same paragraph that: ' ... there is also no evidence in the U.S. State Department report for 2003 (2004) or any of the other sources cited above that people supported it in the past, or who support it now, are being subjected to any serious discrimination or harm, either at a societal level or by agents of the state.'"

Case22070,applied,Fogarty v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 136 ; (2003) 37 AAR 363,"On 11 December 2007, for reasons that it then published, the Tribunal, constituted by Mr Kenny, Member, affirmed the decision under review. 4 Section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) enables an appeal to be brought to this Court from a decision of the Tribunal on a question of law. The questions of law identified in the notice of appeal which has been filed in the court are as follows: (1) whether the Tribunal erred in law by failing to: (a) consider the written statement of the Applicant in evidence before it (exhibit 2); or (b) evaluate the sworn evidence given by the Applicant in his statement (exhibit 2) against that given viva voce when determining whether the applicant experienced ""intense fear, helplessness or horror"" for the purposes of the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. (2) whether the Tribunal erred in law by failing to refer in its reasons for decision that the Tribunal had regard to the sworn statement of the Applicant contained in exhibit 2. (3) whether the Tribunal erred in law, and failed to comply with its obligations under section 43 (2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 , by failing to explain how it treated the Applicant's viva voce evidence of his reaction to the alleged stressor as against the description of said reactions given by the Applicant in his sworn statement (exhibit 2). 5 Section 13 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act renders the Commonwealth liable to pay a pension to a veteran where the veteran has become incapacitated from a war-caused injury or disease. The circumstances in which a disease or injury is taken to be war-caused are set out in s 9 , subs (1), of the Veterans' Entitlements Act . 6 The standard of proof to be applied by the Commission and on review by the Veterans' Review Board or the Tribunal to the question of whether a disease is a war-caused disease is provided for in s 120 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act . Section 120 of that Act provides materially: (1) Where a claim under Part II for a pension in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a veteran, or of the death of a veteran, relates to the operational service rendered by the veteran, the Commission shall determine that the injury was a war-caused injury, that the disease was a war-caused disease or that the death of the veteran was war-caused, as the case may be, unless it is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination. (2) Where a claim under Part IV: (a) in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a member of a Peacekeeping Force or of the death of such a member relates to the peacekeeping service rendered by the member; or (b) in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a member of the Forces, or of the death of such a member, relates to the hazardous service rendered by the member; the Commission shall determine that the injury was a defence-caused injury, that the disease was a defence-caused disease or that the death of the member was defence-caused, as the case may be, unless it is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination. (3) In applying subsection (1) or (2) in respect of the incapacity of a person from injury or disease, or in respect of the death of a person, related to service rendered by the person, the Commission shall be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for determining: (a) that the injury was a war-caused injury or a defence-caused injury; (b) that the disease was a war-caused disease or a defence-caused disease; or (c) that the death was war-caused or defence-caused; as the case may be, if the Commission, after consideration of the whole of the material before it, is of the opinion that the material before it does not raise a reasonable hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person. (4) Except in making a determination to which subsection (1) or (2) applies, the Commission shall, in making any determination or decision in respect of a matter arising under this Act or the regulations, including the assessment or re-assessment of the rate of a pension granted under Part II or Part IV , decide the matter to its reasonable satisfaction. 7 In Fogarty v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 136 ; (2003) 37 AAR 363 at 373, paragraphs 34 and 35, Kenny J, with the agreement of Spender and Tamberlin JJ, observed the following in relation to s 120 and its impact on the standard of proof to be applied by administrators in respect of the determination of claims or their external review: The authorities establish that, where there is an issue as to whether or not a veteran is suffering from a claimed injury or disease, then the commission (and, on review, the board or the AAT) must decide the issue to its reasonable satisfaction, as required by section 120(4) of the Act: see Benjamin v Repatriation Commission [2001] FCA 1879 ; (2001) 34 AAR 270 at 282 per Moore, Emmett and Allsop JJ, Repatriation Commission v Cooke (1998) 90 FCR 307 at 301-311; 28 AAR 400 at 403-404 per French, Drummond and Carr JJ, Repatriation Commission v Budworth [2001] FCA 1421 ; (2001) 116 FCR 200 at 204-205; [2001] FCA 1421 ; 33 AAR 476 at 480 per Ryan, Marshall and Conti JJ, Repatriation Commission v Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 ; (2002) 69 ALD 581 at 598-599 per Black CJ, Drummond and Kenny JJ, and Repatriation Commission v Gosewanckel [1999] FCA 1273 ; (1999) 59 ALD 690 at 700-702 per Weinberg J. As the Full Court said in Benjamin (at 634; 282): "" Section 120(1) of the Act assumes the existence of a relevant injury or disease and provides a standard of proof for the determination of whether that injury or disease was war-caused. When the commission, or the tribunal on review, is required to determine whether a veteran is suffering from a particular injury or disease, that issue must be decided to the reasonable satisfaction of the decision maker, in accordance with section 120(4) of the Act: see Repatriation Commission v Budworth [2001] FCA 1421 ; (2001) 116 FCR 200 at 204 [15] ; [2001] FCA 1421 ; 33 AAR 476 at 480 [15] ,"" Although the AAT is not bound by the rules of evidence the Full Court held in Repatriation Commission v Smith (1987) 15 FCR 327 at 335; 7 AAR 17 at 26, that the requirement in section 120(4) that the AAT must be ""reasonably satisfied"" imports the civil standard of proof. 8 This is a case where there was at issue in the proceeding the threshold question as to whether or not the Applicant was suffering from an injury or disease. In particular, that threshold question came to be whether or not he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Accordingly, the question of whether he was suffering from that condition fell for determination as required by s 120(4) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act according to the reasonable satisfaction of the Tribunal in the way explained in the passage which I have quoted from Fogarty . 19 In the submissions on behalf of the Applicant, much was made of the following passage in Fogarty at para 41: I accept that the AAT was bound to take the report into account in the sense explained by Mason J in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39 in deciding whether or not the veteran suffered from a generalised anxiety disorder. Providing it did so, it was for the AAT to determine what weight should attach to the report. There is, however, no mention of the report in the AATs reasons. On account of this, and on account of the AATs failure at the outset to address the diagnosis issue by reference to the evidence, and on account of the ""methodological confusion"" (as the respondent termed it) in the AATs reasons generally, I will infer that the AAT indeed failed to have regard to the report. In the circumstances of the case this failure constitutes a material error of law. 20 The report in that case was a medical report, but the submission made on behalf of the Applicant was that there was no relevant distinction to be drawn in terms of principle as between the medical report in that case and the written statement to the accuracy of which Mr Drew swore in his oral evidence before the Tribunal. It is true that there is no explicit reference to that statement in the Tribunal's reasons. I was though very helpfully provided, on behalf of the Respondent, with what one might term a ""matrix"" in which analysis is made of the Tribunal's reasons and corresponding references in the written statement which became part of the evidence before the Tribunal. It is quite plain from that that the Tribunal has had regard to the written statement and, indeed, adopted particular passages from it in its reasons. 21 Assuming, therefore, that the written statement might, in terms of the Peko-Wallsend case, be classified as a relevant consideration, I am quite satisfied that the Tribunal did have regard to it in reaching its decision. 23 His Honour observed: As it is now well understood, any court reviewing a decision of the tribunal cannot turn ""a review of the reasons of the decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration for merits of the decision"": Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272. Those quite ""proper principles"" do not allow a doubtful fact finding to be characterised as an error of law. As Kenny J commented in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingim [1999] FCA 794 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 at 257, ""a tribunal does not commit an error of law merely because it finds facts wrongly or upon a doubtful basis or because it adopts unsound or questionable reasoning."" Likewise those ""proper principles"" do not require that it be shown that all matters raised in the proceeding before the tribunal are dealt with in the reasons. For the purposes of section 43(2B) of the AAT Act, the tribunal is not obliged to give a ""line by line refutation"" of an applicant's evidence either generally or in those respects where there is evidence contrary to find things that material fact made by the tribunal: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex Parte Durairajasingham (2000) 58 ALD 609 ; 168 ALR 407: see generally, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 62 ALD 225 ; 180 ALR 1. 24 Though I have, in the manner indicated earlier, some difficulty with the reference by the Tribunal in para 22 of its reasons to the statement of principles, it is tolerably clear from that paragraph that the Tribunal has, against the background of the written statement before it, gained particular assistance from the oral evidence which Mr Drew came to give in addition to that written statement. As it happened, that oral evidence put the Tribunal in the position of not being reasonably satisfied that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. The Tribunal's chain of reasoning on matters of fact appears to have been this. There was a consensus of medical opinion that a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder ought to be made, having regard to criteria in DSM-IV. Those criteria concern matters of primary fact. In particular, one of those primary facts was that described in paragraph (a)(ii) of the DSM-IV publication, and as it happened, the Tribunal, in taking account of all of the evidence before it, and particularly the oral evidence, was not satisfied as a matter of fact that the experience in response of the veteran met the description in (a)(ii). It followed from this that having regard to the medical opinion as to the utility of DSM-IV, no factual foundation for a finding of post-traumatic stress disorder was present. 25 That process of reasoning seems to me to have been both logical and reasonably open on the evidence before the tribunal."
Case7838,cited,Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 ,"The respondents accepted that the making of an order under O 62 r 3 is exceptional. There must be a reason consistent with the dictates of justice to depart from the usual rule: Thunderdome Racetiming and Scoring Pty Ltd v Dorian Industries Pty Ltd (1992) 36 FCR 297. In determining whether it would be in the interests of justice to make such an order, regard must be had to at least the following matters. First, whether there has been any fault on the party seeking an order under O 62 r 3. Secondly, whether it would be fair, in all the circumstances, to require a party in whose favour an order for costs has been made in relation to an interlocutory application to await the hearing of the principal proceeding. Thirdly, the conduct of the party against whom the order for costs has been made and, in particular, whether that party has been guilty of delay such as to cause a significant postponement of the final determination of the proceeding. Fourthly, where the costs relate to amendments to pleadings, whether the party against whom the order is sought has also been unable to articulate its claim or its defence in accordance with its obligations under the pleading rules, which has put the opposing party to significant costs.

Case14789,cited,SVTB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 104,"The first respondent submitted that the RRT was not required to consider subjective factors once it had found that the appellant did not have an objective basis to fear persecution. In the respondent's submission, von Doussa J rejected an argument similar to that of the appellant in SCAM . The respondent maintained that the view of Gaudron J in Chan , and therefore the appellant's argument, was further disapproved by a Full Court of this Court in WAHK . The first respondent submitted that an argument such as that now being put by the appellant had been rejected by the Full Court in SVTB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 104 ("" SVTB "") at [16]-[21]. The first respondent maintained that there was no basis for formulating a different standard where it was found that the visa applicant had left his or her country of origin with a well-founded fear of persecution at that time. 14 The RRT was not in error when if failed expressly to consider the appellant's subjective state. It is true that, if the applicant were to succeed, then the Tribunal had to be satisfied that he subjectively held a fear of persecution if returned to Kenya and that his fear was well-founded. As the Federal Magistrate found, the Full Court decision in WAHK is contrary to the appellant's claim that the RRT was required to consider subjective factors. In WAHK , Lee and Tamberlin JJ said (at [12]-[14]) as follows (emphasis mine): "" Where the RRT has accepted that an applicant had a well-founded risk of persecution at the time of their departure, a question arises concerning the approach that the RRT should take, in view of that finding, at the time it makes its decision concerning whether that applicant would have a well-founded risk of persecution, if they were returned. In [Chan] , Gaudron J, (at 415), accepted that the correct approach to a submission as to changed circumstances is as follows: "" If an applicant relied on his past experiences it is, in my view, incumbent on a decision-maker to evaluate whether those experiences produced a well-founded fear of being persecuted. If they did, then a continuing fear ought to be accepted as well-founded unless it is at least possible to say that the fear of a reasonable person in the position of the claimant would be allayed by knowledge of the subsequent changes in the country of nationality. "" The above view was not shared by Gummow J, who, in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 659, said that the view of Gaudron J in Chan (quoted above) did not represent the view of the Court in Chan . Gaudron J accepted that this observation was correct in the case of Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 at [69] . Her Honour considered that her approach was, nevertheless, correct. The relevant question is whether, as at 29 May 2002, the objective facts establish that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution. This is to be assessed on an objective basis , and not on the basis that the fear of a reasonable person in the position of the claimant would not be allayed by knowledge of subsequent changes in the country of nationality. The reference to a ""well-founded fear"" is a reference to the objective factual position at that time. "" The majority's approach is directly contrary to the position of the appellant in this case. Consistently with WAHK , if the RRT is not satisfied, objectively speaking, that there was a real chance of persecution then it does not have to further consider an applicant's subjective fear. This is because, without a sufficient objective chance of persecution, the applicant cannot have a well-founded fear of persecution: see also WAKZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1065 at [46] - [49] and SVTB at [21]."

But we would add that, even if there had been, the procedure of ordering production of documents for inspection by the legal representatives of one of the parties, even upon a restricted basis, before the claim for immunity had been decided by the court, was open to serious question. Whatever the safeguards, it represents an encroachment upon the confidentiality claimed for the documents. And in this case, public interest in their immunity from disclosure was of the highest order. If inspection of documents is necessary to determine the question of immunity (and in this case it was not) then it ought to be carried out by the court before ordering production for inspection by a party. No doubt this may in some cases cast a heavy burden on the court, but it is unavoidable if confidentiality is to be maintained until a claim for immunity is determined.

In The Queen v Bebic (unreported, 27 May 1982) the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales dealt specifically with the disclosure of the contents of an affidavit tendered in support of a public interest immunity claim. There Samuels JA, Nagle CJ at CL and Cantor J said at 4: Mr Mason tendered an affidavit in support of his claim for privilege. He submitted, however, that the affidavit should not be placed on the file, that is to say that it should be read only by the Court and not disclosed to the party calling, on the footing that the contents of the affidavit would or might themselves compromise the claims for privilege. We had and still have some doubts about the propriety of restricting the affidavit in the way proposed. However, it may well be that that course is, in certain cases, of which this is one, no more than a logical extension of the established practice of the Courts inspecting the allegedly privileged documents itself. Later at 5, after saying that the Court had read both documents in question and the affidavit in support of the claim for privilege, their Honours said: It seems to us that granted that it is now commonplace for judges to make a private inspection of documents in order to resolve a claim for privilege ..., it follows that in a proper case the judge may similarly keep to himself the affidavit by which the claim is supported. The Court then ordered that the affidavit remain sealed up with the papers on the ground that to disclose its contents might prejudice the claim for privilege. In seeking to establish an exceptional case the applicants' point out that they may be unable to make out their cases if the claim to immunity is upheld. The authorities establish that this consequence of the outcome of the process of balancing public interest immunity against the public interest, upon which the applicants rely, of having conventional access to evidentiary material, is not exceptional. Thus in the Scientology case at 76-77 Brennan J referred to the obstacles in a plaintiff's path in judicial review proceedings against the Director-General arising out of the restrictions imposed upon discovery in aid of proving what is and is not relevant to security. In the same case at 61 Mason J noted that a successful claim for privilege may exclude from consideration the very material on which a plaintiff hopes to base his argument. These observations of Mason J were quoted with approval by Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Keifel JJ in Gypsy Jokers Inc 234 CLR at [24]. In that case at [5] Gleeson CJ said that the consequence of success of a claim for public interest immunity against disclosure of information is that the information is not available as evidence to be taken into account in deciding the outcome of judicial review proceedings. The Court would not be able to have regard to some, or perhaps any, of the information on which a public official's belief was based."
Case12615,referred to,Computer Interchange Pty Ltd and Another v Microsoft Corp and Another [1999] FCA 198 ; (1999) 88 FCR 438,"Although there has been no direct judicial consideration of the term ""publication"" in relation to s 50 applications, there appears to be a consensus emerging in the cases on s 50 that this section ""deals expressly with the prevention of information given in open court from entering the wider public arena""; see Computer Interchange Pty Ltd and Another v Microsoft Corp and Another [1999] FCA 198 ; (1999) 88 FCR 438 per Madgwick J at [15]. The word ""domain"" has also been used interchangeably with ""arena""; see generally Johnston v Cameron [2002] FCA 948 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v X [2005] FCAFC 217 ; (2005) 147 FCR 243. In each of these cases, the entering of particular evidence or the name of a party into ""the wider public arena"" or ""domain"" contemplates an act of publication and audience much broader than the limited inspection (and not copying) of documents at the Court Registry by Ms Gee, Mr Agnew and Ms Meredith. 17. The underlying assumption of s 50 is the principle of open justice. The fact that the order must be necessary to prevent prejudice suggests that the party seeking to invoke a power of suppression carries a very heavy onus; see Madgwick J in Computer Interchange at [16] and Weinberg J in Johnston v Cameron at [89]. As such, the Court must consider the alleged prejudice that would be suffered by the respondent should the s 50 order not be granted. The Court must also determine whether the order is necessary to prevent this prejudice and whether this warrants a departure from the ordinary rule that open justice occur."
Case19595,considered,Re Fernandes (1861) 6 H &amp; N 717; 158 ER 296 at 300-301,"Quite apart from its statutory origins, the Federal Magistrates Court has power to punish for contempt (see s 17 of the FMA). It was recognised in the United Kingdom that a court of assize or of nisi prius which had certain powers, including powers to punish for contempt, were regarded as superior courts although not principal superior courts: see Re Fernandes [1861] EngR 489 ; (1861) 6 H &amp; N 717; 158 ER 296 at 300-301. However, for the above reasons such historical indicia of a court have no application to the Federal Magistrates Court. 24 For the above reasons, the submissions of the applicant that the Registrars of the Federal Magistrates Court cannot exercise administrative functions are rejected. 25 The applicant submits that the text of the Oath of Office administered to a Registrar differs from that taken by a Federal Magistrate, and that such difference demonstrates a limitation on the Registrar's powers to issue orders in the name of the Federal Magistrates Court."

Case7874,applied,Heslehurst v Government of New Zealand [2000] FCA 937,"I observed in the case of Heslehurst v Government of New Zealand [2000] FCA 937 at [16] , in the context of an application for bail under s 35(6)(g)(iv) of the Extradition Act : 'The Court does not treat lightly the deprivation of liberty of any person before it, particularly where that person is unwell. However, the Court is obliged to apply the direction of the legislature which places a significant onus in a case such as this on an applicant for bail. It is to be remembered that Australia has continuing obligations to New Zealand which are reflected in the terms of s 35(6) of the Act.' The onus to which I referred in Heslehurst is applicable in this case in a practical, if not a strictly legal, sense (see [4] above). The present application is not brought under s 35(6) of the Extradition Act but Australia's obligations to New Zealand are the same as the obligations to New Zealand to which I referred in Heslehurst . Having given anxious consideration to the material upon which the respondents rely in support of their stay application, I am not satisfied that the material demonstrates the exceptional circumstances necessary to warrant the grant of the stay which they seek. It is open to them to follow the course envisaged by the Extradition Act (ie to make an application to the High Court for bail) with little delay. If such an application is made and it succeeds, the time that they will spend in custody because of the failure of this application for a stay of the Full Court's orders will be brief. The application to stay the orders of the Full Court pronounced this morning is dismissed.

Case21955,cited,SZJXW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 143,"other cases an order has been made appointing one or other of the parents of an infant as a next friend and further orders made dispensing with compliance with the "" formal steps "" otherwise prescribed by O 43: e.g. SZJXW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 143. Notwithstanding the position the Respondent Minister ultimately adopted, namely that no order was sought, his concern as initially expressed should prevail. There should be no uncertainty that the resolution of the present Appeal binds the Appellants. Although an order should not necessarily be made simply "" to avoid doubt "", there should be no uncertainty as to the conclusiveness of a decision of this Court. An order should thus be made appointing the father as the Appellants' tutor. Compliance with the procedural requirements imposed by O 43 before such an order may be made is dispensed with pursuant to O 1 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules . Insistence upon compliance with those "" formal steps "" in circumstances where there is no reason to question the competence of the father to protect the interests of his two sons and where the father is unrepresented would place an unnecessary obstacle in the path of the father advancing the case on behalf of his family. His participation in the Appeal has been taken as implicit consent to his appointment as the tutor for his sons. The first Ground of Appeal asserts a denial of "" Procedural Fairness "" initially by reference to a failure on the part of the Tribunal to carry out its functions in an "" Inquisitorial Manner "". This failure is said to emerge from the statement of the Tribunal that it had "" ' ... considered all of the evidence before it' whereas it made a contrary finding ""."

Case18762,cited,Applicant A165 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 877,"far as actual bias is concerned, I do not think that such a charge has been made out in this case. In order for such a conclusion to be reached by this Court, there would have to be much more by way of evidence than is presently before me. The reasons of the Tribunal, taken on their own, do not betray actual bias on the part of the Tribunal. As the Federal Magistrate said at [16] of his reasons: The applicant has done no more than make the allegation. She has provided no indication of how these difficult hurdles to establishing that allegation may be overcome. The ""difficult hurdles"" referred to by the Magistrate were those cited by him from the judgment of Lander J in Applicant A165 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 877. For the above reasons, there is no error apparent in the decision of the Tribunal or in the approach taken by the Federal Magistrate in reviewing that decision. For these reasons, I propose to dismiss the appeal with costs. The first respondent has sought a fixed sum costs order. The amount which is claimed ($3,470.00) is reasonable. The appellants made no submissions against the making of such an order. Accordingly, I order that the costs of the first respondent be fixed in the amount of $3,470.00.

In my opinion, an argumentative submission that is responsive to an integer of the applicant's case and defensive of the respondent's position would not normally give rise to the type of inconsistency referred to by the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 and applied on the facts of Rio Tinto [2006] FCAFC 86 ; 151 FCR 341 (cf Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101).

Case5952,referred to,AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 ,"the nomenclature in case law often refers to documents it is to be remembered that 'privilege protects confidential communications, and not documents as such.

Justice Young went on to observe at [103]: The decision in Propend turned fundamentally on the proposition that legal professional privilege protects communications rather than documents. This explains why, as the High Court held in Propend , legal professional privilege can attach to copies of non-privileged documents; the purpose of bringing the copy into existence may be different from the purpose of bringing the original into existence, and may attract legal professional privilege: see Brennan CJ at 507, Gaudron J at 544, McHugh J at 553-554, Gummow J at 571 and Kirby J at 587.

A reasonable hypothesis within s 120(3) of the VE Act is a hypothesis that is pointed to by the material before the decision-maker, and not merely left open (or not excluded) by that material. A hypothesis that is not pointed to, but is a matter of assertion or is merely left open by the material, is not a reasonable hypothesis: see East v Repatriation Commission (1987) 16 FCR 517 at 532-533.

Case8057,referred to,Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298,"Further, I reject Mr Spalla's suggestion that I should draw inferences (under the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298) against Mr Rambaldi because Mr Rambaldi failed to call those with whom he negotiated the terms of Deed. Mr Spalla claimed that there was no explanation for the failure to call these witnesses and that they could have provided evidence as to whether the parties understood the Deed to operate as an offer of settlement. While the surrounding circumstances may be relevant to construction, the terms of the condition precedent are clear. No reasonable observer could have interpreted the Deed as anything other than an offer. The language of the document admits of only one meaning: compare Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australian Performing Right Association Ltd [1973] HCA 36 ; (1973) 129 CLR 99 ("" ABC v APRA "") at 105-107 per Barwick CJ and 114-115 per Stephen J.

Her submissions at hearing and her correspondence with the Court continually reiterated that she 'does the work' and that she 'does the travel' . However, the existence of these two facts in isolation does not satisfy the travel test in s 1035(2). The determinative issue before the Tribunal was whether she was required to travel in order to perform the work. The Tribunal found against Ms Budd on such issue and this Court cannot interfere with that finding. 32 It follows from the above that it is not 'in the interest of justice' to grant leave to Ms Budd to file and serve a notice of appeal out of time pursuant to s 44(2A)(a) of the AAT Act.

Case11486,followed,Nile v Wood [1988] HCA 30 ; (1987-1988) 167 CLR 133,"As noted above, s 358(1) of the Act provides that, subject to subs (2), no proceedings shall be had on the petition unless the requirements of, relevantly, s 355, are complied with. The 40 day requirement of s 355(e) is one which must be complied with if proceedings are to be had on the petition within the meaning of s 358(1). In Nile v Wood [1988] HCA 30 ; (1987-1988) 167 CLR 133 the petition failed to include a prayer for relief as required by s 355(b). Justices Brennan, Deane and Toohey stated at 137 that if there are defects in the petition in a failure to comply with s 355, those defects are not capable, by reason of s 358, of being cured by amendment after the period of 40 days fixed by paragraph (e) for the filing of a petition. Accordingly the petition was held to be incurably defective and no proceedings could be had on it (at 140). 19 Accordingly, as the 40 day period has now expired, any amendment to the petition is not available as the petition does not comply with s 355(a) of the Act. 20 The Act does provide one exception to the requirements of s 355. Section 358(2) provides that the Court may, at any time after filing the petition and on such terms (if any) as it thinks fit, relieve the petitioner wholly or in part from compliance with s 355(aa)."
Case14581,cited,"Houssein v Under Secretary, Department of Industrial Relations and Technology (NSW) [1982] HCA 2 ; (1982) 148 CLR 88","Claim 5 of the 981 Patent uses the (+/-) sign so as clearly to indicate that claim 5 was confined to racemic mixtures. That descriptor is not applied to claim 1 or other claims. Arguably, this provides a slight indication that claim 1 was not intended to be limited to racemic mixtures. It also shows that the patentee was aware of particular means by which claims could be limited to a claim to a racemic mixture. This factor is not irrelevant because it is consistent with other indicators that the patent does not exclude the individual enantiomers. However, I am not disposed to attach significant weight to it: see Ranbaxy (UK) Ltd v Warner-Lambert Company [2006] EWCA 876 ( 'Ranbaxy UK' ) at [30] per Jacob LJ; see also the warnings given about the incautious use of the expressio unius maxim of construction in Houssein v Under Secretary, Department of Industrial Relations and Technology (NSW) [1982] HCA 2 ; (1982) 148 CLR 88 at 94 and Wentworth v NSW Bar Association [1992] HCA 24 ; (1992) 176 CLR 239 at 250."
Case17634,followed,Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666,"seminal authority in relation to the meaning of ""insolvency"" is Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 in which the High Court considered the meaning of insolvency under s 95 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan and Windeyer JJ agreed) said at 670-671: ""... Insolvency is expressed in s. 95 as an inability to pay debts as they fall due out of the debtor's own money. But the debtor's own moneys are not limited to his cash resources immediately available. They extend to moneys which he can procure by realization by sale or by mortgage or pledge of his assets within a relatively short time relative to the nature and amount of the debts and to the circumstances, including the nature of the business, of the debtor. The conclusion of insolvency ought to be clear from a consideration of the debtor's financial position in its entirety and generally speaking ought not to be drawn simply from evidence of a temporary lack of liquidity. It is the debtor's inability, utilizing such cash resources as he has or can command through the use of his assets, to meet his debts as they fall due which indicates insolvency. Whether that state of his affairs has arrived is a question for the Court and not one as to which expert evidence may be given in terms though no doubt experts may speak as to the likelihood of any of the debtor's assets or capacities yielding ready cash in sufficient time to meet the debts as they fall due."" What is made clear in Sandell v Porter and restated in subsequent cases is that a temporary lack of liquidity does not mean that there is insolvency. As Mandie J pointed out in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (supra) at 209, s 95A of the Act provides a ""cashflow test"" of insolvency which Mandie J described as follows: ""The cashflow test provides that a company is insolvent when it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. It is of no consequence, under this test, that assets exceed liability. The important point is: can the company pay its way in carrying on its business? The court, in examining whether a company is suffering cashflow insolvency, will consider whether the Company is actually paying its debtors"". The authorities in relation to determining whether a person or a company is insolvent were exhaustively analysed by Mandie J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (supra) particularly at pars [370]-[380]. I do not propose to rehearse those authorities but would adopt, with respect, the analysis by Austin J in Re United Medical Protection Ltd (prov liq appt) [2003] NSWSC 1031 ; (2003) 47 ACSR 705 at 718 where his Honour said the following points emerge from Mandie J's review of the authorities: ""whether or not a company is insolvent ... is a question of fact to be ascertained from a consideration of the company's financial position taken as a whole"", and is a question to which '[c]ommercial realities will be relevant"": Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd (in liq) v DCT [2001] NSWSC 621 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 213 at 224; [2001] NSWSC 621 ; 188 ALR 114 at 124-5; [2001] NSWSC 621 ; 39 ACSR 305 at 316-17 per Palmer J; ""it is useless to say that if its assets are realised there will be ample to pay 20 shillings in the pound: this is not the test. A company may be at the same time insolvent and wealthy"": Re Tweed Garages Ltd [1962] Ch 406 at 410 per Plowman J; ""it is thus of no consequence, of itself, that assets exceed liabilities, the important point being whether the company can pay its way in carrying on its business"": see A R Keay, ""The insolvency factor in the avoidance of antecedent transactions in corporate liquidations"" (1995) 21 Monash Univ LR 305 at 307); ""the question is not whether the debtor would be able, if time were given to him, to pay his debts out of his assets, but whether he is presently able to do so with moneys actually available"": Bank of Australasia v Hall [1907] HCA 78 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1514 at 1528 per Griffith CJ; ""It is the debtor's inability, utilising such cash resources as he has or can command through the use of his assets, to meet his debts as they fall due which indicates insolvency"": Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 670 per Barwick CJ; ""If, as a matter of substance, the company is not able to pay its debts as they become due, the circumstance that the relevant creditors may give the company some time before they actually seek to enforce their remedies, and the company may well be able to pay them out given that time, will not negative the application of the section"": Standard Chartered Bank of Australia Ltd v Antico (Nos 1 &amp; 2) [1995] NSWSC 31 ; (1995) 38 NSWLR 290 at 331 per Hodgson J; ""for the purpose of assessing insolvency, a contractual debt is taken to be payable at the time stipulated for payment in the contract, unless there is evidence of an express or implied agreement between the company and creditor for extension of time, or a course of conduct sufficient to give rise to an estoppel against the creditor, or an established practice in the industry or between the company and its creditors whereby debts are taken to be payable at some other time than provided for in the contract: Southern Cross Interiors at NSWLR 225; ALR 125 ; ACSR 317."""
Case12501,cited,Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia v Linter Textiles Australia Limited [2005] HCA 20 ; (2005) 220 CLR 592,"It should be recalled that context is not merely the Act as a whole, including its text and structure, but context ""in its widest sense"": CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408. The relevant words are considered by reference to the language of the statute as a whole in their legal and historical context having regard to the evident aim and purpose of the legislation and provision in question, to any canons of legal construction and to any inconvenience or improbability of result of any given construction. Fundamental to the task is the giving of close attention to the text and structure of the relevant provisions as to the words used by Parliament: Braverus Maritime Inc v Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd [2005] FCAFC 256 ; (2005) 148 FCR 68 at [36] and the cases there cited, and Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia v Linter Textiles Australia Limited [2005] HCA 20 ; (2005) 220 CLR 592 at [50] ."
Case5212,referred to,Godfrey Constructions Pty Ltd v Kanangra Park Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 36 ; (1972) 128 CLR 529 ,"In Australia, part of the impetus for the recognition of a implied duty to act in good faith has been the desirability and practice of courts in controlling reliance on general rescission clauses so as to prevent their use "" for improper and extraneous purposes "": see Godfrey Constructions Pty Ltd v Kanangra Park Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 36 ; (1972) 128 CLR 529 at 548; Pierce Bell Sales Pty Ltd v Frazer [1973] HCA 13 ; (1973) 130 CLR 575 at 587 (per Barwick CJ); and Burger King at [151]. In light of these matters and of the foregoing analysis, the issue is whether the conduct of BreakFree, in the course of negotiations and ultimately relying on its power to terminate the HofA under cl 2.2.2, judged objectively, demonstrated a lack of good faith."
Case12535,cited,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559,"The Minister submitted that on a fair reading of the Tribunal's decision in its entirety, the Tribunal based its decision on the appellant's past activities in Burma and also his activities in Australia. According to counsel for the Minister, the activities in which the appellant engaged in Australia were such that the appellant would not have a high profile he was merely a 'noisy face in a crowd'. The Minister submitted that the Tribunal had not erred in the way in which it looked at the appellant's past behaviour and transposed it into the future, citing Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559. The Minister also submitted that it can be inferred that as the appellant had the unrestricted right to engage in political activity in Australia, but did not join a political party for two years, he would not engage in activities on return to Burma that would bring him to the adverse attention of the authorities. 27 The Minister contended that the Tribunal's consideration of the behaviour modification claim does not reveal any error, let alone jurisdictional error. In the Minister's submission, it is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons that it looked at the claims presented by the appellant and determined that it was not satisfied that he has a well-founded fear of persecution. In doing so, the Tribunal did not fail to ask the correct question. 28 As Phipps FM identified, the Tribunal did not consider the behaviour modification claim. Accordingly the issues to be determined in this appeal are whether that claim arose from the evidence before the Tribunal and, if so, whether the Tribunal's failure to consider it amounts to jurisdictional error."
Case15692,cited,Mark Foys Pty Ltd v TVSN (Pacific) [2000] FCA 1626 ; (2000) 104 FCR 61,"In order for the applicant to substantiate its case under s 53 , the applicant needs to establish that, by the use of the confusingly or deceptively similar name and mark (""bing""), the first respondent has represented that it has the necessary connection with the applicant such that a substantial number of members of the public will believe that the first respondent or its services has the sponsorship or approval of the applicant ( 10th Cantanae Pty Ltd v Shosana Pty Ltd (1987) 79 ALR 299 at 301-302; Mark Foys Pty Ltd v TVSN (Pacific) [2000] FCA 1626 ; (2000) 104 FCR 61 at 77-78). 83 This finding is further supported by the absence of evidence before me that either the applicant or its products have a reputation from which the first respondent would be able to benefit (cf Australian Home Loans Ltd t/as Aussie Home Loans v Phillips [1998] FCA 181 ; (1998) 40 IPR 392 ; Mark Foys Pty Ltd v TVSN (Pacific) Ltd [2000] FCA 1626). Other than evidence of a small number of inquiries temporarily confusing the applicant with the first respondent, there is no evidence that the applicant or its products and service are sufficiently well-known that a substantial number of members of the public, or even a substantial number of members of those sections of the public which are likely to engage either with the applicant or respondent, would be misled in terms of ss 53(c) or 53 (d) TPA."
Case22692,referred to,Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 ; (2007) 228 CLR 651,"Court has an unfettered discretion in determining whether and on what basis to award costs: see Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 ; Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 ; (2007) 228 CLR 651. It is common for costs to be awarded in favour of a successful Applicant in contempt proceedings: see BHP Steel at 351; Rip Curl International Pty Ltd v Phone Lab Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 496. Courts, however, have awarded costs on a party and party basis (see: for example, Jones v Toben (No 2 ) [2009] FCA 477) and on an indemnity basis (see: for example, BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2002] FCA 702). The reason that indemnity costs are frequently awarded where an applicant has successfully prosecuted charges of contempt is that the applicant has not been seeking any remedy on its own behalf but rather has been upholding the various public interests which are served by prosecutions for contempt of Court."
Case14412,discussed,SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 ; (2007) 159 FCR 291,"on this issue, I refer to the decision of the Full Court in SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 ; (2007) 159 FCR 291. I have given anxious thought to whether that decision, which is of course binding on me, dictates a different conclusion to the one I have reached. Where the Tribunal has been differently reconstituted following the quashing of its initial decision, that case decided that s 424A did not require the Tribunal as newly constituted to re-give particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review. I do not think that decision dictates an opposite conclusion. Clearly, in the case of a Tribunal reconstituted under ss 422 or 422A, where the Tribunal's task is to ""finish the review"", that decision is apt. It may also be apt where the Tribunal has been reconstituted under s 421, where at least in one sense the process of review by its consideration of a member of the Tribunal recommences. In the latter circumstance, the activating fact to enliven s 424A must be the assessment of the information by the Tribunal as constituted. If, however, as appears to have been the case in that decision, the Tribunal as reconstituted formed the same view about certain information as the Tribunal as previously constituted, because (as the Full Court pointed out at [42]) the giving of the required notice may be given administratively, the notice given earlier would satisfy s 424A. The second ground of review, so the applicant argues, is that the Tribunal wrongly asked whether the applicant is a conscientious objector rather than whether he would refuse to undergo further military service if he were to return to Israel. For that reason, I have put the words ""conscientious objector"" in quotation marks in the heading to this part of my reasons. The critical part of its reasons are set out at [15] above."

Case21068,referred to,"Re Summers and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2005] AATA 125","The written submissions include reference to the Legal Services Directions 2005 , Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and to the 'Model Litigant' responsibility referred to in Re Summers and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2005] AATA 125. Mr Croker submits that the standard of fair dealing which was referred to in such authorities applies to the Commonwealth as a model litigant. 47 The facts giving rise to Mr Croker's claim and the relief claimed in the current proceedings are, subject to the increase in damages claimed from $100,000 to $200,000, the same as those referred to in NSD 2478 of 2006 which were transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court and became proceedings SYG 548 of 2007. Those proceedings were dismissed because Mr Croker did not comply with the order made by Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones on 31 October 2007. 48 The statements of claim in both proceedings NSD 2478 of 2006 and in the current proceedings include claims under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), breach of warranty and a claim for 'wrongfully defending a claim' . The last mentioned claim is predicated upon the basis that the Commonwealth is required to observe a policy of fair dealing pursuant to the direction of the Attorney-General under s 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)."
Case16817,considered,O'Keefe v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1559,"The order sought by the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant in this case may be distinguished however from such cases as Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; 174 CLR 178 and Gore [2002] FCA 354 ; 119 FCR 429 in that, in this case, costs are sought by a non-party against a party to the litigation. While claims by non-parties seeking costs in their favour against parties to litigation are rare, they are not unknown: for example Re Pan Pharmaceuticals; Selim v McGrath [2004] NSWSC 129 and O'Keefe v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1559. In O'Keefe [2005] FCA 1559 Nicholson J said in the context of such claims in the Federal Court: ""17 The jurisdiction of the Court to award costs is found in s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia 1976 (Cth) ('the Act '). It follows from the terms of that section that the jurisdiction is conditioned by there being 'costs' and those costs being in 'proceedings before the Court'. Section 4 of the Act defines 'proceeding' to mean 'a proceeding in a court, whether between parties or not, and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of, or in connexion with, a proceeding...'. In Knight v FP Special Assets Limited [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 it was held by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, McHugh J dissenting, that the discretion to award costs under O 91 r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland was not confined to the parties in the proceedings. That rule provided for the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in the court to be in the discretion of the court or judge. Gaudron J at 205 stated that it was contrary to long-established principle and wholly inappropriate that a grant of power to a court should be construed as subject to a limitation not appearing in the words of the grant; that is, the words used should be given their full meaning unless there is something to indicate to the contrary. Therefore, her Honour stated the necessity for the power to be exercised judicially tends in favour of the most liberal construction. 18 In O'Keeffe Nominees Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd (1995) 55 FCR 591 at 597 Spender J stated that, in the absence of any express restriction on the orders for costs that may be made concerning intervention or associated with it, the unfettered discretion conferred on the Federal Court by s 43 of the Act applied in the context of awarding costs in favour of a non-party intervener. 19 In King v GIO Australia Holdings Limited [2001] FCA 1773 ; (2001) 116 FCR 509 at 515, after referring to what was stated by Spender J in O'Keeffe , Moore J said he was prepared to assume that s 43 of the Act is cast in sufficiently wide terms as to enable the Court to make an order for costs in the proceeding for the benefit of a non-party. 20 This line of authority, although not greatly developed, would support a conclusion that there is power in the Court pursuant to s 43 to make an order for costs in favour of a non-party."" 42 Ultimately in O'Keefe [2005] FCA 1559 his Honour did not need to decide the issue. In Pan Pharmaceuticals [2004] NSWSC 129 Barrett J took the view that ""some very special factor outside the ordinary and expected course of events and engendering a justifiable expectation of compensation in the mind of the non-party would have to be found before any relevant aspect of the comprehensive jurisdiction with respect to costs might be regarded as properly and regularly invoked in favour of a non-party as against a party. In other words, such an award, if ever appropriate, will be extraordinary and exceptional"" (at [20]). His Honour in that case declined to make an order in favour of the non-parties seeking costs.

Case10537,followed,Connop v Varena Pty Ltd (1984) 1 NSWLR 71,"One such factor is the ability to register a judgment for costs in the overseas jurisdiction. In resisting the Motion for security, the Applicants contend that the ability to register a judgment overseas has the consequence that such a judgment "" will be as effective ... as it would be in the case of a plaintiff who did not ordinarily reside "" overseas: Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs [1984] FCA 89 ; (1984) 2 FCR 463. That was also an application for security and the case was said to raise "" an important question as to the ambit of the discretion of the court to make an order for security for the payment of costs in a case where the applicant is ordinarily resident outside Australia "". Morling J reviewed the authorities, including the decision of Rath J in Connop v Varena Pty Ltd [1984] 1 NSWLR 71 and concluded at 469 70: In Connop v Varena Pty Ltd ... Rath J dealt with a somewhat similar case. In that case the plaintiff was ordinarily resident in New Zealand. There is legislation in force in New Zealand which makes it possible to enforce (by registration in that country) a judgment of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. His Honour said that an order for costs against the plaintiffs in that case could be register without difficulty in New Zealand, although there might be some delay inconvenience and expense arising from registration of the judgment. Having referred to those matters he said: ""But apart from this I see no difference in regard to the costs of the first and second defendants between the circumstances of this case and those of a similar case where a plaintiff is not ordinarily resident outside this State. With only minor reservations, a judgment for costs will be as effective against the plaintiffs here as it would be in the case of a plaintiff who did not ordinarily reside outside this State: see Re Percy and Kelly (etc) Co (1876) 2 Ch D 531 , per Jessel MR, at 531."" His Honour made an order for security for costs, fixing the amount of security at $750. This sum was apparently an estimate of the cost of registration and execution in New Zealand of a judgment for costs in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in favour of the defendants in the action before him. Particular reliance is placed by the Applicants upon the approach pursued by Rath J."
Case13192,cited,Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v G E Capital Finance Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352,"a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading: see Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v G E Capital Finance Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [45] . The underlying principle is that the need for a summary judgment must be clear before the court will intervene to prevent a plaintiff submitting a case for determination in the usual way. Once it appears that there is a real issue to be determined, whether it be of fact or law, and that the rights of the parties depend on it, the court should not terminate the action by way of summary judgment. As Barwick CJ said in General Steel at 129-130, great care must be exercised to be sure that under the guise of achieving expeditious finality a plaintiff is not improperly deprived of the opportunity to have his or her case tried by the appointed tribunal. The general principle that a person should not lightly be shut out from a hearing is cogent the onus on the party applying for summary judgment is heavy."
Case15534,referred to,The Queen v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Limited [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100,"Inadequacy of the material relied on by the administrative decision-maker, while not itself being a ground for prohibition is a circumstance which may support, in a case like the present, the inference that the Commission was applying the wrong test or was not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters: The Queen v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Limited [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100 at 120. There, Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ referred to the important distinction between a mere insufficiency of evidence or other materials to support a conclusion of fact when the function of finding the fact has been committed to a person or body by the Parliament and, on the other hand, the absence of any foundation in fact for the fulfilment of the conditions upon which, in point of law, the existence of the power depends. They said that it was not enough if the repository of the power, properly interpreting the section of the Act under which it was conferred and applying the correct test: ""... nevertheless satisfies itself or himself on inadequate material that facts exist which in truth would fulfil the conditions which one or other or both of those paragraphs prescribe. The inadequacy of the material is not in itself a ground for prohibition. But it is a circumstance which may support the inference that the tribunal is applying the wrong test or is not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters. If there are other indications that this is so or that the purpose of the function committed to the tribunal is misconceived it is but a short step to the conclusion that in truth the power has not arisen because the conditions for its exercise do not exist in law and in fact."" 183 As McHugh and Gummow JJ identified in S20/2002 198 ALR at 76 [73] the principle in Melbourne Stevedoring 88 CLR at 120 does not depend upon unreasonableness but upon the absence of a factual basis in which the power could be exercised. For the reasons that I have given above, in reality, the Commission was not satisfied of the requisite matters upon which its power to make the final determination depended, namely, it acted on the misconception that the presence of a soft dial tone demonstrated the existence of an unconditioned communications wire or ULLS. This was because of its misunderstandings of the subject matter with which it purported to deal, that I have described. The Commission's determination was therefore unreasonable and an improper exercise of power."
Case975,cited,Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1,"material before this Court includes the respondent's statement of facts and contentions before the Tribunal. This document at [27] advanced the contention that 'Great Bamboo Pty Ltd was not an eligible business because it was not a business in the necessary sense' . In support of this contention it made reference to Mason J's consideration in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 of the meaning of 'business' in a phrase such as 'carrying on a business' . There his Honour stated that in the context of the rating provisions of the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW) the phrase 'carrying on a business' denoted activities 'engaged in for the purpose of profit on a continuous and repetitive basis' (at 8-9). The respondent's statement of facts and contentions before the Tribunal argued that Mr Koosasi's business did not appear 'to have been carried out on an ongoing or repetitive basis' . At [28] the same document advanced the alternative contention that Great Bamboo was not an eligible business because it did not meet any of the requirements listed in the definition of 'eligible business' in s 134(10). In support of this contention the document made reference to the absence of evidence that Mr Koosasi had developed business links with the international market. It also noted that Great Bamboo had not created and was unlikely to create employment, that it had not introduced new or improved technology into Australia nor had it increased commercial activity or competitiveness in the Australian economy. At [39] of its written reasons for decision the Tribunal conflated the two submissions of the respondent identified above, noting: 'The respondent also submits that the business is not an ""eligible"" business as it has only completed four export transactions since its registration in January 2003 and such limited number could not be considered continuing or repetitive ... there is no evidence the company has developed links with international markets; and the company has not created employment; exports of wheat, flour and juice has not introduced any new or improved technology to Australia.'

Case22186,cited,Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146,"Perusal of the original Defence supported the respondents' claim that they conceded liability inadvertently: compare Defence, par 8. Bearing in mind the accepted principles, the respondents should have leave to file an Amended Defence, as counsel for the applicants properly conceded at the hearing: see Cropper v Smith (1884) 26 Ch D 700 at 710 per Bowen LJ; Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 at 152 153 per Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; and Johnston v Vintage Developments Pty Limited [2006] FCAFC 171 at [23] per Tamberlin, Jacobson and Rares JJ. If the respondents were granted the leave they sought, no injustice would be done the applicants that could not be remedied by an award of costs in their favour."
Case22236,considered,"Chairman, National Crime Authority v Flack (1998) 156 ALR 501","By his written submissions in reply, the applicant contends that: ""[The applicant] was required to produce a thing which was not in his 'custody, possession and/or control' in the requisite sense . In circumstances where: (a) the notice ... required the production of the ... DVDs 'forthwith'; (b) [the applicant] was afforded no opportunity to verify the contents of the DVDs; and (c) [the applicant] was handed the ... DVDs at a time when his presence at the [Commission's] offices was involuntary possession of the 'thing' did not pass to [the applicant]."" (The emphases are in the original.) The applicant also cites Chairman, National Crime Authority v Flack (1998) 156 ALR 501 as discussing the relevant authorities. (The Commission does not dispute the facts set out in sub-paras (a) to (c) of the passage quoted above.) 48 The applicant's contentions in the passage quoted at [47] are fundamentally unsound. The qualification of ""custody, possession and/or control"" by ""the requisite sense"" begs the question of what that sense is. The terms of the notice are clear. There is no reason to read them down. In the events that occurred, possession however fleeting of the DVDs passed to the applicant when they were handed to him. It is beside the point that they were created by the Commission and handed to him in the knowledge or with the intention that he would immediately thereafter be compelled by way of the notice to hand them back. Until he was so compelled he was in possession of them. It is also beside the point that he was not in possession of them when the notice was issued as opposed to when the notice was served on him. As far as he was concerned, the notice was a dead letter unless and until it was served on him. 52 The authorities discussed in Flack avail the applicant nothing. They include the 'finding' cases of Bridges v Hawkesworth (1851) 21 LJQB 75, South Staffordshire Water Company v Sharman [1896] 2 QB 44 and Parker v British Airways Board [1982] 1 QB 1004. This is not a 'finding' case. The DVDs were handed to the applicant at the Commission's offices. The question whether the Commission intended to exercise control over its offices to the extent that it owns things found therein by strangers simply does not arise for determination."
Case25126,discussed,Le v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 427,"First, according to the learned Federal Magistrate, the Tribunal failed to discharge its obligations under s 360 of Act by failing to ensure Ms Le and her children were given an adequate opportunity to present their case and by proceeding in the absence of an interpreter. His Honour held that ""where a hearing has not concluded in the sense that witnesses available have not given evidence ... there is a continuing obligation on the part of the Tribunal to ensure that the invitation to the hearing remains genuine and is not simply a hollow or empty gesture"": see Le v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 427 (' Le v Minister' ) at [62]. His Honour added at [64]: ""If an opportunity has been given during the hearing for a further hearing to occur then that opportunity should be conveyed through and [sic] interpreter to the Applicant. Failure to do so in my view renders the process which occurred after the interpreter left the hearing room as meaningless. There is no evidence that the Tribunal arranged for its transcript to be made available to the Applicant or that it sought any assurance that what had been said at the Tribunal hearing would be interpreted. Instead the Tribunal relies on knowledge that the agent apparently had 'Vietnamese' staff and that the agent could 'arrange to explain what we have discussed with your client when you've got use of some staff to help explain to her'."" 26 The Federal Magistrate also had regarded to what he called the agent's ""significant concessions"", made in the absence of an interpreter and without knowledge of the content of the s 359A letter: see Le v Minister at [65]-[66]. His Honour noted that the agent was unwilling to accept responsibility for determining whether there should be a further hearing and purported to leave this matter to the Tribunal. His Honour considered the agent's failure to press for a further hearing involved an ""extraordinary concession"" in the circumstances of the case: see Le v Minister at [66]. His Honour described the agent's approach to the Tribunal as ""obsequious"". The agent was, so his Honour thought, more concerned with his personal preference than with the interests of his clients. His Honour regarded the agent as negligent in failing to press for a further hearing in order that the other witnesses could give their evidence. His Honour remarked, at [67], that: ""There is simply no evidence to suggest that the clear invitation properly referred to by the Tribunal was ever passed on in detail to the Applicant. It would be wrong for the Court to assume that it occurred ... The exchange between the agent and the Tribunal was critical. Without the offer being accurately and contemporaneously interpreted the conclusion I reach is that offer of a further hearing upon receipt of the s 359A letter could not properly by interpreted as a genuine offer and the ongoing obligation of the Tribunal to ensure that its original hearing is valid."" 27 Further, his Honour noted the ""clear evidence of circumstances which at the very least would bring into question the voluntariness of the withdrawal of the sponsorship document"", as well as the fact that the purported withdrawal had not been properly translated. He observed, at [72]-[73], that: ""At the very least the other evidence of the witnesses available to the [sic] called but not called due to the absence of the interpreter may have provided the Tribunal with other evidence in the absence of the departmental officers which would have made it less likely for the Tribunal to rely upon the written document obtained on the Applicant's allegations after a five hour interview without a break and without refreshment. The obligations imposed upon a Tribunal under s.360 should not be narrowly confined to an invitation to appear but also to 'give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review'. It is the invitation to give evidence and present arguments that is crucial. The giving of evidence is not confined simply to the Applicant but extends to those witnesses whom the Applicant has evinced an intention to call. It is not appropriate for the Tribunal to simply seek to transfer the obligation it has under s.360 to the Applicant's agent. In the present case it is particularly inappropriate to extend the further invitation in the absence of an interpreter when the Tribunal cannot be satisfied that the extension of that invitation has been accurately interpreted and communicated to an Applicant."" 28 For these reasons, his Honour found that there had been a breach of s 360 of the Act. 29 Secondly, the Federal Magistrate found: (1) the Tribunal ought to have made additional enquiries pursuant to ss 359 and 363 of the Act to obtain evidence from or about the Minister's officers and their conduct; and (2) the Tribunal made an assessment of the facts that was not reasonably open to it. Accepting that there was no general duty on the Tribunal to make enquiries, his Honour said, at [89]-[90]: ""However, in this instance the Tribunal was able to easily request the attendance of the relevant Departmental officer or officers who conducted the interview which resulted in the withdrawal of sponsorship. It was after all the interview process which was subject to significant challenge and the voluntariness of the withdrawal statement questioned. Whilst the Tribunal was able to assess the subsequent explanation from the nominator as to why the withdrawal document had been signed it should in my view following my reasoning in relation to the previous ground have permitted the Applicant to adduce further evidence in support of the application which may have given greater corroboration to the likelihood or otherwise of the withdrawal having been made voluntarily. It could then assess evidence from relevant Departmental officers. Although the decision of Wilcox J in Prasad appears to be obiter, it is obiter which I am prepared to follow to the extent that in this instance for the Tribunal to proceed to a decision without making any attempt to obtain evidence from the Departmental officers that it conducted itself in a manner which could properly be described as exercising a decision-making power in a manner so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have so exercised it. By making a finding that it did not accept the Department's officers 'would have fabricated his admissions or pressured him into formally withdrawing his sponsorship' the Tribunal was not making an assessment of the facts reasonably open to it. Accordingly this ground succeeds."" 30 His Honour found that the other grounds for judicial review were not made out. The Minister challenges his Honour's judgment."

Consideration of the exercise of the discretion In determining whether to grant the extension of time requested by the appellants it is necessary to take into account a number of factors, in addition to the futility factor. First, the appellants' failure to lodge their notice for taxation within the required time period does not appear to be due to deliberate delay on their part. The appellants were dissatisfied with the claim for remuneration by the trustee and gave early notice to him that they would seek a taxation of the claim. The appellants attempted to lodge a notice within the requisite time and appear to have made a genuine mistake about whom the notice should have been sent. They did not realise that they needed to apply to ITSA. The fact the appellants have provided a reasonable explanation as to why they failed to comply with the requirements of reg 8.09(1) is a matter which weighs in favour of granting an extension of time."

Without limiting the other powers conferred on the receiver by these orders, the receiver have the power to: (a) determine the position that the third respondent should take in these proceedings; (b) have the conduct of these proceedings on behalf of the third respondent; (c) instruct solicitors to appear and to file and serve any documents in the proceedings; and (d) subject to the approval of the Court, enter into and give effect to any agreement for the resolution of all or part of these proceedings so far as they affect the third respondent. 4. For the purposes of orders 2 and 3 of these orders the receiver have all of the rights and powers: (a) of a member of the third respondent; (b) of the third respondent as a shareholder in the second respondent; (c) of the board of management of the third respondent including, without limitation, the power to manage any and all of the assets and undertakings of the third respondent in such manner as he considers appropriate, consistent with the objectives of the third respondent, and for the purposes of the conduct or resolution of these proceedings; (d) as may be reasonably incidental to the pursuit of any of those purposes or the exercise of any of the powers conferred by these orders. 5. In order to enable him properly to discharge his functions and exercise his powers under these orders, the receiver may obtain independent commercial and legal advice as he deems appropriate, including without limitation the advice of senior counsel. 6.

See: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 8) (2006] FCA 1825 7 Subsequently the University and CRI by its receivers, entered into a further settlement agreement on 22 February 2007 (the Terms of Settlement). It provided for the creation of a new charitable trust in essentially the same terms as had been contemplated by the agreement made on 31 July 2006. It also provided: 3. CRI and UWA instruct Mrs Elizabeth Heenan to prepare the documents required to constitute the Trust in accordance with the following principles: (a) the Trust be a charitable trust; (b) the primary objects of the Trust are to be: (i) to support and promote cancer research and education, including without limitation funding cancer research and education at a state, national and international level; and (ii) to establish, maintain and administer a public fund or funds for any charitable purposes it may decide in relation to cancer research and education. (c) the Trust be managed by a Board of Management initially comprising: (i) a chairman appointed by UWA, CRI and the WA Institute for Medical Research (""WAIMR"") jointly; (ii) two nominees proposed by WAIMR; (iii) one nominee appointed by CRI; (iv) one nominee appointed UWA, with the intention that all persons to be appointed to the Board of Management be acceptable to each of UWA, CRI and WAIMR. The University and WAIMR acknowledge that CRI may propose as its nominee a representative of the Walter &amp; Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (""WEHI"") and the University and WAIMR agree that they will have no objection to a representative of WEHI being appointed to the Board provided the nominee is otherwise appropriately qualified; (d) an external national/international scientific committee (""the scientific committee"") be appointed by the Board of Management to advise and assist the Board of Management and to oversee and facilitate the peer review process; (e) the Trust deed will include provisions the purpose of which is to ensure that the Board of Management/the scientific committee observe proper corporate governance principles including those that relate to conflicts of interest in assessing and determining the best method of achieving the Trust's objects and it is specifically agreed that the Trust deed will incorporate: (a) provisions for the utilisation of an international peer review process for the assessment and allocation of grants from the Trust; and b) all research conducted pursuant to grants from the Trust shall be conducted in accordance with the Joint NHMRC/AVCC Statement and Guidelines on Research Practice (1997) or such other guidelines as may replace those guidelines; (f) WAIMR provide administrative support (to be audited annually) to the trust; (g) The Trust deed will include provisions for the establishment of a nominations committee to call for and examine suitable appointees to the Board of Management to replace retiring Board members from time to time; (h) Any disputes between the parties as to the terms of the Trust deed will be resolved by Mrs Heenan having regard to the objects of the Trust, the terms of this document and considerations of fairness and equity. Mrs Heenan must give the parties the opportunity to make representations to her in such manner as she may in her absolute discretion think fit.

Upon the constitution of the Trust and the appointment of its inaugural Board of Management, CRI shall transfer to the Trust all of its assets. ... 6. The Trust will pay any taxation liabilities including stamp duty that may arise in consequence of the transfer of assets referred to in paragraph 4 above, out of those assets. 7.

Case15782,cited,Kovalev v Minister for Immigration [1999] FCA 557 ; (2000) 100 FCR 323,"The principles which apply in this situation are not in doubt. In Kovalev v Minister for Immigration [1999] FCA 557 ; (2000) 100 FCR 323 ("" Kovalev "") at 326-328, French J explained the relevant principles: ""In making a consent order the Court exercises judicial power. This is a power conferred upon it by the Parliament under Ch III of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Its exercise is a public function and operates to bind the parties. Its public character applies to agreed orders disposing of private litigation between citizens or corporations and proceedings brought by or against governments and their agencies or public authorities. An order disposing of proceedings by consent must be self-explanatory as must any order. It is not appropriate to make an order of uncertain content or the content of which is to be derived from materials which are not on the public record. There is a fundamental difficulty where a court makes an order remitting a matter to a decision-maker or tribunal to be decided 'according to law' and the court itself is not informed of the nature of the error conceded. The court is then making an order without being apprised of its basis and proposed operation. To do so in my opinion is a purported, but not an actual exercise of judicial power. Moreover, in a practical sense the decision-maker or tribunal lacks the benefit of any binding direction from the court as to precisely what it is that the decision-maker or tribunal is required to do. In the present case the precise concession which led to the proposed consent order had not been communicated by the respondent to the applicant. The possibility arose that the matter could have been remitted to the Tribunal with the parties themselves not being ad idem as to the error of law which had led to the decision being set aside and which the Tribunal was required to rectify. And even if there had been such an agreement the terms of the order proposed would not have disclosed to the public what the parties had agreed should be its content. In the particular case where a tribunal decision is set aside, the Tribunal itself is not usually a party and has played no role in the negotiation of the agreement that it erred in law. A fortiori in that case the order must be clear and complete and the Court must be satisfied that it is appropriate. ... ... It is well-established that in making a consent order or indeed in accepting undertakings the Court must have regard to the limits of its power. The parties cannot, by consent, confer power on the Court to make orders which the Court lacks power to make Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission ( 1981 ) [1981] HCA 48 ; 148 CLR 150 at 163. The question whether a consent order is to be made, is not concluded by a finding that it is formally within the power of the Court. In the exercise of its power the Court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute (WA) Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 at 86 and the authorities referred to there. It is important therefore that the Court itself addresses and is satisfied of the basis upon which its order is to be made and in particular where the order sets aside the decision of an official decision-maker or a tribunal. ... ... In the case of error of law attributed to a decision-maker or tribunal there is a particular public interest which requires the Court's specification of the error and its satisfaction that error occurred. It is also a substantial discourtesy for a court to overturn the decision of an official decision-maker and a fortiori that of a statutory tribunal without consideration of the error that leads to the decision being overturned or communication of the terms of that error to the decision-maker or tribunal. If such a determination is to be set aside on the basis that it has failed to apply or has misapplied the law whether substantive or procedural, there may potentially be some precedential impact in other like cases. To permit the principle underlying the order to be formulated only by the parties in their submissions to the decision-maker or the Tribunal leaves the content of that principle in the hands of the parties."" As French J noted, Sackville J had adopted a similar approach in Sanchez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 265. Subsequently, Stone J in Yulianti v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 142 agreed with the views expressed by French J and Sackville J. Her Honour observed in addition that the grounds for the making of the order can appear in the Court's reasons for judgment, rather than in the order itself. Similar views were expressed by RD Nicholson J in Xiao v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 459 ; (2001) 109 FCR 129. The principles explained by French J in Kovalev have been approved numerous times: see Re Allan and Repatriation Commission (2003) 77 ALD 140 at 144-145 [12]-[14]; Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 132 FCR 93 at 110 [55] - [56] ; and WAKM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 730 at [5] ."

Case21686,cited,Tableland Peanuts Pty Ltd v The Peanut Marketing Board (1984) 58 ALJR 283,"This is an application for interlocutory injunctive relief pending the trial of proceedings which were instituted on 15 February 2006. THE NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS 2 The applicant is an academic at the University of Ballarat (""UB""). He is presently employed as a senior lecturer and course co-ordinator of the Bachelor of Arts (Humanities and Social Sciences) course at the Mt Helen campus of UB. He is a member of the National Tertiary Education Industry Union (""NTEU"") and holds two official positions with it, namely a member of its national council since 1998 and branch president of its UB branch since 2000. 3 The proceedings are brought by the applicant as a representative party pursuant to Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (""the FCA Act ""). According to the application, the group members whom the applicant represents are 'all academic staff and general staff (other than casual academic staff, casual general staff and TAFE general staff)' employed by UB as at 14 February 2006. 4 The proceedings arise out of allegedly misleading statements that were made by UB to its staff members on 14 December 2005 (""the December 2005 statements""). The applicant alleges that the December 2005 statements contravened s 170WG(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (""the WR Act ""), which provides: ""(2) A person must not knowingly make a false or misleading statement to another person with the intention of persuading the other person to make, or not to make, an AWA or ancillary document."" The December 2005 statements were made in the context of UB offering Australian Workplace Agreements (""AWAs"") to its staff. 5 The final relief sought in the proceeding comprises: (a) the imposition of penalties on UB under s 170VV of the WR Act; (b) a declaration that UB contravened s 170WG(2) of the WR Act; (c) injunctions requiring UB to refrain from knowingly making a false or misleading statement to the group members with the intention of persuading them to make an AWA, and to publish a correcting statement; and (d) damages and interest. 6 The applicant seeks the following interlocutory relief pending the hearing and determination of the application or further order: (a) UB refrain from offering, entering into or taking any step to make, formalise, register or have approved an AWA with a group member; (b) UB refrain from knowingly making a false or misleading statement to the group members and/or each of them with the intention of persuading group members and/or each of them to make an AWA; and (c) UB cease contravening s 170WG(2) by publishing to each group member a statement correcting the false and/or misleading statements referred to in the affidavit of the applicant sworn 14 February 2006. BACKGROUND 7 In recent years, the terms and conditions of employment of staff at UB have been governed by an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement known as the University of Ballarat Enterprise Agreement for Academic and General Staff, 2000-2003 (""the EBA""). The EBA was made pursuant to s 170LJ of the WR Act . Although its nominal expiry date was 30 June 2003, the effect of s 170LX is that it continues to govern the terms and conditions of the employment of relevant employees of UB, other than those employees who have subsequently entered into an operative AWA with UB. 8 Between June 2003 and late 2005, various efforts were made by the NTEU and/or UB to introduce a new agreement that would govern the terms and conditions of employment at UB. Initially, the NTEU unsuccessfully sought to negotiate an agreement pursuant to s 170LJ. Subsequently, UB made two unsuccessful attempts to make an agreement directly with its academic and general employees pursuant to s 170LK. The first of these proposed s 170LK agreements went to a ballot of staff members between 17 and 21 October 2005. The ballot rejected the proposed agreement, with 451 staff members voting against the agreement and 335 for it. The second proposed agreement went to a ballot of staff members between 22 and 23 November 2005. Again, the ballot resulted in a rejection of the agreement, with 401 staff members voting against it and 323 voting in favour of it. In connection with these two ballots, the NTEU and UB distributed a considerable amount of information and other material to affected staff members. This material drew attention to differences that existed between the proposed s 170LK agreements and the provisions of the EBA. 9 After the failure of the second ballot, UB commenced offering AWAs to its staff members. The AWAs were, broadly speaking, modelled on the agreements which had been rejected by the ballots. THE ALLEGEDLY MISLEADING STATEMENTS 10 UB commenced offering AWAs to staff members by way of an email sent by the Vice Chancellor of UB to all staff members on 14 December 2005. The email attached a link by means of which a copy of the proposed general staff AWA could be viewed by staff members. 11 On 14 December 2005, shortly after the dispatch of the Vice Chancellor's email, Mr Wesley Walker on behalf of UB sent an email to all staff concerning the AWAs (""the December 2005 email""). Mr Walker was a consultant to UB in relation to workplace relations. He was heavily engaged in the unsuccessful efforts to introduce a new agreement governing staff terms and conditions in the period between 2003 and late 2005. The December 2005 email was headed 'AWA Questions', and provided as follows: ""The University has commenced offering AWAs to staff, as notified in an email earlier today. The NTEU has also started its campaign against AWAs by placing posters around the campus that ask you to consider four questions. Well, I'm happy to answer those questions. Q1. Will you be giving away key employment conditions? A. No you won't. All the important employment conditions including hours of work, span of hours, overtime, shift penalties, HDAs, superannuation, incremental progression, meal breaks, and all leave entitlements remain unchanged in the AWA. Q2. Will an AWA now guarantee you future pay increases? A. Yes it will. Three pay increases are guaranteed. An increase of 4.5%, back-paid to July 2004 is guaranteed for those employees signing AWAs prior to 31 March 2006. An increase of 4.5% in January 2006 is guaranteed. An increase of 4.5% in January 2007 is guaranteed. A fourth increase of 4.5% in January 2008 is contingent as before, but is very likely to be paid in full. Q3. Will you be diminishing your job security? A. No you won't. The AWA has nothing to do with your job security. The AWA is concerned with your terms and conditions of employment, just like the proposed collective enterprise agreement. There is no connection between the AWA and your contract of employment. If you have a continuing appointment now, you will still have your continuing appointment after you sign the AWA. Q4. Will you have the right to return to the collective agreement when the AWA expires? A. Yes you will. After the AWA reaches its expiry date it can be replaced by another AWA with further benefits, or it can roll on in its present form, or you can terminate it and return to the collective agreement that is in place at the time. In addition the question and response below should be of special interest to staff. Q5. What happens if a new enterprise agreement (LK to LJ) is settled next year and has conditions better than those contained in the AWA? The University Council at its meeting on 13 December 2005 passed the following resolution 'That any new HEWRR * Compliant EB Agreement (LK to LJ) be settled with conditions of employment and salary levels that are overall not greater than those specified in the collective AWAs available to general staff and academic staff.' Agreements settled after 31 March 2006 will have the requirement that any payment of back-pay, at the very best, be limited to 1 January 2006. Also an AWA may be varied during its operation if the employee and University agree. I'll be happy to answer any other questions you may have about AWAs, but please be a little patient because of the workload this activity has now generated."" The applicant founds his case of misleading statements on this email. 12 The applicant alleges that the statements which appear under Question 1 and Question 3 are false and misleading, and contravene s 170WG(2). The essence of the complaint is that, in respect of important employment issues, namely redundancy, probationary employment, termination and discipline and dispute settling procedures, there are significant differences between the terms and conditions in the proposed AWA when compared with the prevailing terms and conditions in the EBA. I shall not attempt to detail the material differences between the two sets of terms and conditions. They are helpfully summarised in the applicant's outline of written submissions. It is unnecessary to set out the detailed differences because UB concedes that there are differences and that the differences are not insignificant. 13 The applicant contends that the statement which appears in the December 2005 email under Question 1 is false and misleading because the significant differences that do exist make it clear that staff members will in fact lose 'key employment conditions' under the AWA which they would otherwise be entitled to under the EBA. Further, he contends that the significant differences that exist between the two sets of conditions also make it clear that 'important employment conditions' in the EBA have been changed by the proposed AWA. UB acknowledges that changes have been made, but disputes the proposition that the changes involve the loss of key employment conditions or a change in important employment conditions. 14 In relation to what appears under Question 3, the applicant submits that the December 2005 email conveys to academic and general staff that the terms of the AWAs being offered by UB have no impact or bearing on the security of employment of staff members who sign the AWA. The applicant submits that this representation is false and misleading, as the proposed AWAs will substantially diminish a number of EBA protections for employees in respect of how termination of employment or discipline may be affected. In short, the allegation is that the AWAs will make it easier for UB to terminate or discipline academic and general staff, thereby adversely affecting their security of employment. It is put that provisions in an industrial instrument which go to the method of termination of employment directly concern security of employment: see Re Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia; Ex parte Wooldumpers (Victoria) Limited [1989] HCA 10 ; (1989) 166 CLR 311 at 336 per Gaudron J. 15 Section 170WG(2) is concerned with 'knowingly' false or misleading statements. The applicant submits that this element of the alleged contraventions will be made out because Mr Walker was directly responsible for the negotiation of the EBA, and also had the conduct of the later unsuccessful attempts to introduce a replacement agreement on behalf of UB. As a result, Mr Walker had very detailed knowledge of the terms of the EBA, and the respects in which they differed from the proposed AWAs. In these circumstances, the applicant submits that there is a serious question to be tried that Mr Walker knew all of the essential matters which would go to make up the alleged contravention of s 170WG(2), whether or not Mr Walker perceived that the statements in the December 2005 email were false or misleading: see Yorke v Lucas (1985) 159 CLR 661 at 669 per Gibbs CJ; and King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd (2001) 184 ALR 98 at 104-106. 16 The applicant contends that the December 2005 statements amounted to continuing representations, which may influence staff members who are contemplating the making of an AWA with UB. Without conceding that there was anything false, misleading or inaccurate about the December 2005 statements, UB disputed the ongoing influence of those statements. UB relies upon an affidavit sworn by Mr Walker on 22 February 2006 which points out that a significant amount of additional information has been provided to staff members since 14 December 2005. 17 On 27 January 2006, UB modified the information on its web page concerning the AWAs. In particular, the section headed 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' was amended to include, inter alia , the following statements: ""5. Does the AWA change my employment status? The AWA is concerned with your terms and conditions of employment (just like a collective agreement). Your contract of employment determines whether you are employed on a full-time, part-time, continuing or fixed-term basis. Entering into an AWA does not affect this. So, for example, if your current employment status is as a continuing employee, that status will not change. 6. Will I be giving away key employment conditions if I sign an AWA? Important employment conditions in the current enterprise agreement remain in the general staff AWA. These include hours of work, span of hours, overtime, shift penalties, HDAs, superannuation, incremental progression, meal breaks, all leave entitlements, flexible work arrangements, 48/52 employment, public holidays, annual closedown, broadbanding, make-up pay, and salary packaging. Some of these conditions, for example, overtime, shift penalties and HDAs do not apply for academic staff and have not been included in the academic staff AWA. The current enterprise agreement was drafted 6 years ago and, obviously, provisions in that agreement and the AWAs are not identical. For example: &#8226; the dispute resolution procedure in the AWA is the model procedure prescribed by the Employment Advocate; &#8226; the AWA does not include appeals or review committees that review decisions made in cases of redundancy, unsatisfactory performance, misconduct and academic probation. The AWA does include a process for appeals in the case of termination of employment. If you have a concern about a particular entitlement that is important to you, you should raise that concern with Human Resources, who will explain any difference between the AWA and the enterprise agreement. ... 8. Will I have the right to return to the collective agreement when the AWA expires? After the AWA reaches its nominal expiry date it can be replaced by another AWA, or it can roll on in its present form until it is replaced, or it can be terminated according to the provisions in the AWA and/or the legislation. If you and the University agree, your AWA can be terminated at any time. What happens after an AWA is terminated depends on whether it is a pre-reform AWA , or an AWA made after the amendments to the Workplace Relations Act come into force (expected to be in March 2006). A pre-reform AWA is one that is made before the amended legislation comes into force. If you have a pre-reform AWA and it is terminated at any time, you will revert to the collective agreement that is in place at that time. An AWA that is made after the amended legislation comes into force (ie a post-reform AWA) can be terminated on 90 days notice by you, your bargaining agent (which might be the union), or the University after the AWA reaches its nominal expiry date. Until the terminated AWA is replaced by another AWA or a collective agreement made after the date of termination you will revert to the Fair Pay and Conditions Standards set by the Australian Fair Pay Commission, and to protected award conditions. In addition, the University may give an undertaking as to the terms and conditions of employment that will cover you if the University terminates the AWA after it expires."" 18 The applicant submitted that this information did not correct all of the misstatements in the December 2005 email, and it was simply posted on UB's web page. In contrast, the December 2005 statements were sent by email to all staff members. 19 Mr Walker deposes that information sessions concerning the proposed AWAs were held with academic and general staff in late December 2005 and in January and February 2006. At these sessions, Mr Walker says that he explained the workplace disputes clause and the differences between the procedure put in place by the AWA when compared with the EBA. In addition, Mr Walker deposes that if any staff member was misled by the December 2005 email, then the information sessions conducted by UB and the changes to the 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' web page would have made clear to them that a number of conditions of employment, including those relating to managing under-performance, discipline for misconduct and serious misconduct, redundancy and the resolution of workplace disputes would be altered by the AWA. 20 UB also relied upon an affidavit by Ms Penelope Faith Irish, a manager employed by UB in the area of accommodation services. She deposes that she signed an AWA after attending an information session with Mr Walker. She refers to differences between the EBA and the AWA in the area of redundancy entitlements, redundancy review processes, dispute resolution processes and the process to manage unsatisfactory performance and allegations of misconduct, but considered those issues to be peripheral and not important to her personally compared with other matters covered by the AWA. 21 UB also relies upon the fact that since 14 December 2005, the NTEU has provided extensive information to staff members drawing their attention to differences between the proposed AWAs and the EBA. In his submissions, Dr Jessup QC, senior counsel for UB, recognised that information published by the NTEU may not have the same authority or significance as correcting information that is published by UB. GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTIONS 22 The general principles governing the grant of interlocutory injunctions are well settled. The Court must be satisfied that there is both a serious question to be tried in the principal proceeding, and that the balance of convenience favours of the grant of an injunction: see Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Limited [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618; American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396; Australian Coarse Grain Pool Pty Ltd v Barley Marketing Board of Queensland (1983) 57 ALJR 425; Tableland Peanuts Pty Ltd v The Peanut Marketing Board (1984) 58 ALJR 283; Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1984) 3 FCR 55; and Patrick Stevedores Operations (No 2) Proprietary Limited v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 ("" Patrick Stevedores ""). These two questions are not considered in isolation from each other; the strength or weakness of the claim will have a bearing on what is required by way of balance of convenience: see Bullock v The Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia (No 1) (1985) 5 FCR 464 at 472. 23 The High Court has recently stressed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 ("" ABC "") that an interlocutory injunction is granted in aid of some legal or equitable right to final relief: see Gleeson CJ at 217 [11]-[12] and 218 [16]; Gaudron J at 232 [60]; and Gummow and Hayne JJ at 240-241 [88]-[91] and 248 [105]. Gummow and Hayne JJ said that the basic proposition where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought is that it is necessary to identify the legal (which may be statutory) or equitable rights which are to be determined at trial and in respect of which there is sought final relief which may or may not be injunctive in nature (at 241 [91]). I leave aside for the moment, as the High Court did, cases where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought in some special statutory jurisdiction, and cases where the integrity of the judicial process is protected by forms of relief such as the Mareva order or anti-suit injunctions. 24 The purpose ordinarily served by an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo. The way in which Gleeson CJ put it in ABC was that the justice and convenience of imposing an interim restraint, pending the hearing of the final action, if it exists, lies in the need to prevent the practical destruction of the right that is sought to be vindicated by the proceedings before there has been an opportunity to have its existence finally established (at 217 [12]). This formulation may not be apt in every case, but it draws attention to the fact that there must be an appropriate connection between the form of interim relief that is sought, the danger or damage that is sought to be averted by the interim relief, and the final relief which is claimed in the action. 25 The Court will also consider whether damages are an adequate remedy. This can be undertaken separately from an examination of the balance of convenience: see, for example, Castlemaine Tooheys Limited v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148. But it can also be undertaken as part of the assessment of the balance of convenience, and this is, perhaps, the more common approach. 26 One final and perhaps obvious point that bears repeating is that the Court does not embark on anything resembling a trial of the action when it deals with an application for interlocutory relief. Ordinarily, the Court will not attempt to reach any conclusion as to the facts or matters in dispute, beyond satisfying itself as to whether there is a serious question to be tried, or about other matters that may bear on the balance of convenience or discretionary considerations. SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE TRIED 27 On the material before me, I have concluded that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether the December 2005 email contained statements which were knowingly false or misleading, and which were made to staff members of UB with the intention of persuading them to make an AWA with UB. In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account the significant differences that exist between the EBA and the proposed AWAs, and evidence indicating that Mr Walker has a detailed knowledge of both instruments. 28 This conclusion, however, does not end the inquiry, as UB challenges the applicant's legal entitlement to relief on other grounds. Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant has not established that the interim relief he seeks is properly connected with any final relief to which the applicant has a legal or equitable right. In this context, Dr Jessup relies upon the width of the claims for interlocutory relief. Despite criticism of the terms of relief, the applicant did not seek to narrow the form of the interlocutory injunctions it seeks. As to the first order, Dr Jessup submitted that s 170WG(2) would not support an interim injunction restraining UB from taking any further step to enter into an AWA with a group member. This form of relief, he said, was not directed at restraining the making of, or containing or ameliorating the consequences of, allegedly misleading statements, and would go beyond the relief that could be granted at final trial. Dr Jessup criticised the second order on the grounds that it was expressed in broad and sweeping terms, and no Court would issue a restraining order in terms that UB must refrain from making false or misleading statements to group members. Such an order would do no more than replicate the general terms of s 170WG(2). Dr Jessup criticised the third injunctive order that was sought on the ground that a mandatory order requiring UB to correct the false or misleading statements in the December 2005 email would prejudge the outcome of the case. In my view, there is some force in these criticisms. 29 Next, Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant cannot seek an interim order preventing UB from making an AWA with him in circumstances where the applicant asserts that he has not been misled and will not in any event make an AWA. In Dr Jessup's submission, the applicant is not seeking an interlocutory remedy for himself, but is trying to do so for other members of the group. For those members of the group who have already made an AWA, and for those like the applicant who do not intend to make an AWA, it is difficult to say that the interlocutory relief that is being sought is in aid of final relief. The form of relief that is sought is arguably relevant only to those members of the group who have not yet made an AWA, but who may wish to do so. 30 An applicant in a representative proceeding must himself or herself have standing to sue a particular respondent: see Symington v Hoechst Schering Agrevo Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 164. There is no doubt that the question whether conduct challenged under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) was misleading or deceptive can warrant determination on a representative basis, notwithstanding the fact that inducement might be an element of each individuals cause of action: see King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [2000] FCA 1543 at [13] - [14] . The applicant submitted that a representative action can be brought seeking final declarations and final injunctions in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(2). 31 In Schanka v Employment National (Administration) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 202 ; (2000) 97 FCR 186, the Full Court (comprised of Ryan, Lee and Branson JJ) considered objections to standing in respect of a proceeding that alleged contravention of s 170WG(1) of the WR Act . The proceeding in question was a representative proceeding under Pt IVA of the FCA Act . The Full Court rejected an argument that a penalty could not be imposed under s 170VV in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(1) unless the conduct constituting the duress brought about the making of an AWA. The Full Court said that such a construction should be rejected because it would allow even the most reprehensible conduct engaged in by a party in relation to a proposed AWA to go unexamined by a Court if no concluded agreement were to come into existence. On its proper construction the WR Act supported a wider availability of the remedy afforded by s 170VV. In addressing this issue, the Full Court also considered whether the trial judge, Moore J, had erred in adding an individual, Mr James Burns, as an additional applicant. The alleged error was said to have arisen because Mr Burns had declined the offer of employment and so had never become a party to an AWA. The Full Court construed the reference in s 170VV(3) to 'a party to the AWA or ancillary document' so as to include a party to negotiations. 32 It follows therefore that an action for penalties and injunctive relied under ss 170VV and 170VZ can properly be constituted as a representative action: see Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1999] FCA 1250 ; (1999) 94 FCR 179. I also note that s 33C of the FCA Act provides that a representative proceeding may be commenced whether or not the relief sought is the same for each person represented. And I entirely accept the proposition that nothing in s 170VZ excludes this Court's powers under s 23 of the FCA Act to grant an interim or interlocutory injunction in an appropriate case: see Patrick Stevedores at 29 [27] per Brennan CJ; and Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1760 ; (2000) 104 FCR 80 at 103 [96] . Nonetheless, it may be a different question whether an applicant can bring an application for interlocutory relief in a representative proceeding, where the applicant has no individual entitlement to that relief, but the relief is sought on the basis that it may be relevant and necessary for other members of the group. 33 Dr Jessup's submissions may also raise issues about the identification of the group members. In this case, the application alleges that a common issue of law and fact arises, namely whether the December 2005 statements made on behalf of UB were knowingly false or misleading with the intention of persuading the academic and general staff to make the AWA, within the meaning of s 170WG(2) of the WR Act . In respect of these issues, the group may be composed of three different classes of members: first, those like the applicant, who have not signed the AWA and do not intend to do so; second, those who have not signed the AWA and who may wish to do so; and third those who have signed the AWA. The affected groups or sub-groups may need to be defined more precisely: ss 33Q and 33ZB of the FCA Act . 34 I have not had the benefit of full argument on any of the issues raised by these submissions. I do not propose to express from views about the submissions discussed in [28] to [29] above. In all the circumstances, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the applicant has demonstrated a serious question to be tried as to its entitlement to relief at trial. In view of the matters relied upon by Dr Jessup, however, I consider that the case that has been demonstrated by the applicant at this stage is towards the weaker end of the spectrum. As will appear it is unnecessary for me to be more definitive, as I have reached the conclusion that the application for interim relief should be refused on other grounds. BREACH OF AN IMPLIED TERM OF TRUST AND CONVENIENCE 35 The applicant's outline of written submissions contains an allegation that an implied term of trust and confidence should be implied into each group member's contract of employment with UB: see generally Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 144; Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 116 IR 186 ; and Heptonstall v Gaskin (No 2) (2005) 138 IR 103. The outline further alleges that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached this implied term by recklessly or knowingly making false or misleading statements to its staff members concerning the terms and conditions of employment which would apply to them if they entered into the proposed AWAs. 36 The application by which these proceedings was instituted does not contain any reference to these allegations. Nor is it mentioned in any of the affidavits that were filed by the applicant in support of its application for interlocutory relief. The first notice that UB had of these allegations came when the applicant's counsel handed up the outline of written submissions at the commencement of the interlocutory hearing. In these circumstances, Dr Jessup said that he did not intend to address any submissions to these allegations. 37 I am not satisfied at this stage that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached any such implied contractual term. The basic case that has been put is simply that Mr Walker made statements that were false and misleading in circumstances which gave rise to a contravention of s 170WG(2). 38 In view of the lack of notice of these allegations to the respondent, and the lack of evidence directed to the breach of the alleged implied term, I do not propose to discuss these allegations any further. I note as well that the applicant hardly addressed any submissions to the alleged breach of implied term. BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 39 The grant of an interlocutory injunction is discretionary. In exercising that discretion, the Court will closely examine the balance of convenience. This involves weighing up the extent of any impending prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant if injunctive relief is not granted pending trial, and weighing that against the extent of any hardship that the grant of the injunction may cause the respondent. It also needs to be borne in mind that the purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo, and that the interlocutory injunction is granted so as to preserve or protect the legal or equitable rights that are sought to be vindicated in the proceedings. One relevant inquiry for the Court will be whether irreparable injury which is not compensable in damages will result if relief is not granted. 40 The applicant submits that irreparable harm will occur if injunctive relief is not granted. He submits that the Court is not empowered to revoke an AWA even if it is made in reliance on false or misleading statements made in contravention of s 170WG(2). This is said to follow from the fact that an AWA, once filed, takes on a statutory character. Section 170VM sets out the circumstances when an AWA may be terminated, and the applicant points out that none of them apply to the present circumstances. Further, the applicant submits that the Court is not empowered to make an order for damages in respect of any loss suffered in consequence of a breach of s 170WG(2). UB also submitted that the Court is not empowered to set aside an AWA after it has been filed, and takes on a statutory character. 41 The applicant's case for interlocutory relief was based on the premise that the December 2005 statements were continuing to operate, and might mislead staff members into making an AWA between the time of the hearing and the determination of the proceeding. The interim relief is not relevant to those members of the group who have already made AWAs, or those members of the group who, like the applicant, possess full information and do not intend to make an AWA. 42 In my opinion, the legitimate purpose of an interlocutory injunction at this point, pending trial, is to eliminate or mitigate the risk that staff members of UB might be misled by the December 2005 statements into making an AWA if no relief is granted. 43 The starting point, therefore, is to consider what relief, if any, is just, convenient or necessary at this point to address the risk that the December 2005 statements are continuing to operate and may influence staff members to enter into an AWA with UB. 44 UB has submitted that the continuing influence of the December 2005 statements is likely to be minor, if they have any continuing effect at all. UB submits that the academic community at UB is generally well informed about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWAs. Moreover, UB submits that the December 2005 statements have been overtaken by a substantial amount of subsequent information. While there is some force in these submissions, there must remain a risk that the December 2005 statements may have some ongoing influence on some staff members. 45 UB has submitted that any case which might otherwise have existed for the grant of interim relief is met by UB's preparedness to offer an undertaking to the Court. A form of undertaking was provided to me during the course of the hearing. In essence, the undertaking is to the effect that UB will make a further extensive clarification statement to all staff members identifying the differences between the proposed AWA and the EBA. Further, UB said that it would undertake to refrain from entering into AWAs with its staff members until the expiry of a period of seven days after the publication of the new information to its staff members. By this means, UB submitted that any risk that staff members might enter into an AWA on the basis of misleading or false statements would be removed. 46 At the time of the hearing of the interlocutory application, the applicant and his counsel had not had a full opportunity of considering the terms of the proposed undertakings. I directed that the parties consult with each other about the terms of the proposed undertakings. I further directed that UB submit a final form of the proposed undertakings after a process of consultation had taken place. UB has now submitted a final form of the proposed undertakings. I have been informed that the parties have agreed upon the terms of the clarification statement, but no agreement was reached about other aspects of the proposed undertakings. I shall not set the proposed undertakings in these reasons, as they are recorded in the orders which I propose to make. 47 In my opinion, the undertakings proposed by UB are a complete answer to the application for interim relief. The proposed undertakings remove any real risk that staff members will be induced to enter into AWAs between the date of my order and the date of trial as a result of the allegedly misleading statements that were made in December 2005. 48 In the light of the undertakings proffered by UB, I consider that the hardship that would be occasioned by the grant of wide interlocutory injunctions of the kind sought by the applicant outweighs any prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant and other group members that would be occasioned by withholding relief. The undertakings afford the best means of preserving the status quo pending trial, and address the risk that the December 2005 statements may have a continuing influence on staff members. In short, the undertakings produce an outcome that is both just and convenient. 49 A number of other factors support the conclusion that it is neither just nor convenient to grant the interlocutory relief sought by the applicant. Some of them are discretionary factors. 50 First, the relief sought by the applicant is cast in extremely wide terms and arguably goes beyond relief that could be legitimately sought in this proceeding. 51 Secondly, the relief sought by the applicant would seriously impinge upon the rights of third parties. An injunction restraining UB from entering into an AWA with its staff members pending the trial of this action would seriously affect the rights of those staff members, including their entitlement to back-pay. The applicant submits that the risk that such employees would lose their entitlement to back-pay if AWAs cannot be concluded by 31 March 2006 is an arbitrary limitation that was imposed by UB, and it can be varied at UB's discretion. I will assume that this is so. Nonetheless, it is relevant to the exercise of my discretion that the form of relief that has been sought will significantly affect the rights of other staff members. Their rights will be affected if the injunction were to go, whether or not the employees have fully informed themselves about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWA. Employees may be so affected even if they opt out of the represented group. If there is another alternative that protects staff members from the risk that they will be misled by the December 2005 statements, such as that offered by the undertakings, it is a relevant consideration that the more drastic alternative proposed by the applicant will affect the rights of third parties. 52 The applicant submits that the position of third parties will be protected by its undertaking as to damages. The usual form of undertaking in this Court extends beyond the damages which may be suffered by the respondent consequent upon the interlocutory order, and includes damages that may be suffered by other persons. In this case, the applicant has proffered his own undertaking jointly with an undertaking by the NTEU. I accept that a joint undertaking as to damages by the applicant and the NTEU is one of substance. However, I do not consider that the availability of the undertaking can justify the making of an interim order that will seriously affect third party rights, in circumstances where there is another alternative that is both just and convenient and which will not adversely affect third party rights. 53 In this case, I would not discount the significance of the impact on third party rights in the way that Finkelstein J did in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2000) 106 IR 139 at [57]. CONCLUSION 54 For the foregoing reasons, I propose to dismiss the application for interlocutory relief. I do so upon the basis of the undertakings proffered to the Court by UB. I certify that the preceding fifty-four (54) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.

Case24341,applied,Council of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2006] FCAFC 199 ; (2006) 156 FCR 275,"The principles relevant to the application of this section were summarised by the Full Court in Council of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2006] FCAFC 199 ; (2006) 156 FCR 275 at [60] in the following terms: ""The question therefore arises whether, as contended by counsel for Ms Hart, the plaintiff instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause. A party does not institute proceedings without reasonable cause merely because that party fails in the argument put to the Court: R v Moore; Ex parte Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia [1978] HCA 51 ; (1978) 140 CLR 470 per Gibbs J at 473. The section reflects a policy of protecting a party instituting proceedings from liability for costs, but that protection may be lost. Although costs will rarely be awarded under the section and exceptional circumstances are required to justify the making of such an order (see Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd (1976) 26 FLR 257; 13 ALR 365 per Northrop J), a proceeding will be instituted without reasonable cause if it has no real prospects of success, or was doomed to failure: see Kanan v Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union (1992) 43 IR 257 per Wilcox J; see also Bostik (Australia) Pty Ltd v Gorgevski (No 2) (1992) 36 FCR 439; and Nilsen v Loyal Orange Trust (1997) 76 IR 180."" 63 As the Full Court said in Kangan "" at [63] "" [i]t is a matter of judgment, sometimes of fine judgment, in all the circumstances of a particular case whether a proceeding is brought without reasonable cause . The phrase "" vexatiously or without reasonable cause "" was described by von Doussa J in Hatchett v Bowater Tutt Industries Pty Ltd (No.2) (1999) 28 FCR 324 at 327 as "" similar to the one applied by a court on an application for the exercise of summary power to stay or strike out proceedings ""."
Case19810,cited,Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1271,"In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327 , a Full Court of the Federal Court, while not determining whether the Court had power generally to order interrogatories to be answered in judicial review proceedings, said that it saw no reason ""why there should be a differentiation in Australia between the power to order discovery and the power to order that interrogatories be answered"". 46 To grant leave to interrogate in the circumstances presented here would be to encourage not merely ""fishing"" but full-scale ""trawling"". It is well-established in relation to discovery that a party who can demonstrate nothing to support an allegation will not be granted access to the documents of the opposing party in the hope of discovering some such support. See, for example, WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman. This principle applies with equal force to those seeking relief under the ADJR Act : Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Wong at [29]-[32]. It is not open to a party merely to allege that a decision was made without any proper basis and then seek to use the compulsory process of the Court to attempt to find out if that allegation has any foundation. Before discovery can be ordered, there must be some evidence that can support an arguable case for review, proof of which is likely to be aided by requiring production of relevant documents. 48 It should not be thought that I reject absolutely the use of additional evidence on judicial review. While generally the state of mind of the decision maker would be irrelevant in judicial review, there are cases which warrant the reception of such evidence: see, for example, Percerep v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1088 ; (1998) 86 FCR 483 and McCormack v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation Large Business &amp; International [2001] FCA 1700 at [38] . For example, allegations of actual bias may require evidence relating to extraneous matters going far beyond the material before the decision maker. Claims of improper purpose typically present evidentiary difficulties. The Court must determine, in cases of that type, whether a stated purpose was in fact the real purpose. Such claims often fail for lack of sufficient evidence. On occasion, however, documents obtained on discovery and answers to interrogatories can provide evidence of motive or purpose and, accordingly, may be of relevance. See, for example, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Wong at [26]."
Case8683,cited,Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225 ,"Although, because of the construction that I have adopted of s 853(2) of the WR Act, it is not necessary for me finally to determine whether the judgment of the District Court pronounced on 15 October 2007 is interlocutory, I strongly incline in favour of the view that it is interlocutory. In Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 at [4] - [5] McHugh ACJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ said: ...the usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order, as made, finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them. That question is answered by determining whether the legal effect of the judgment is final or not. If the legal effect of the judgment is final, it is a final order; otherwise, it is an interlocutory order. The order of Gleeson CJ refusing to grant leave to issue process was an interlocutory order. It did not finally determine Ms Luck's rights against the various defendants, if she has any such rights...(emphasis in original) 28 A similar view of the distinction between a final order and an interlocutory order had been taken by McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225. In that case their Honours characterised an order of a judge of the High Court dismissing an application for the removal of a cause pending in the Family Court into the High Court as an interlocutory order."

His Honour said: ""Deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: see Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginbeeri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 106-107 and 112-113. However, the disobedience will amount to a criminal contempt if it involves 'deliberate defiance or, as it is sometimes said, if it is contumacious': see Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 530 ... However, as all proceedings for contempt are now regarded as criminal in nature, all of the charges must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: see Witham at 534.""

Case3274,cited,Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1,"Whether a question of law is raised by an appeal from the Tribunal is itself a question of law. The leading authority is the judgment of Mason J, with whom Gibbs, Stephen and Aickin JJ agreed, in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7. His Honour there stated the rule in these terms: the question whether facts fully found fall within the provisions of a statutory enactment properly construed is a question of law. However, Mason J went on to qualify that statement by pointing out that when a statute uses words according to their ""common understanding"", and the question is whether the facts as found fall within such words, the question is one of fact. The example his Honour cited was the decision of the House of Lords in Brutus v Cozens [1972] UKHL 6 ; [1973] AC 854 where the question raised by the applicable statute was whether the appellant's behaviour was ""insulting"". As it was not unreasonable to hold that the behaviour was insulting the question was one of fact."
Case21359,discussed,"Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1","In relation to the issue of adequate State protection, Nicholls FM referred to the appellant's reliance on Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ("" Khawar"") . The Magistrate distinguished Khawar at [22], observing that:- ""In the 'Khawar' case, which was authority for the proposition that even though the applicant was persecuted by private individuals, and in that case it was domestic violence that she feared from her husband and members of her husband's family, if the authorities condone or tolerate such action then it could be said that women who are the objects of such a violence from private individuals in circumstances where this is tolerated or condoned by the authorities, then such women could constitute a particular social group. Mr. Archibald's comment that there is some resonance, in that the harm in that case and in the case before me came from private individuals and not from the government is correct in so far as it goes, but the case before me can be clearly distinguished on the basis that the facts pertaining to Mrs Khawar's case were clearly and plainly before the Tribunal and it was in that context that the High Court said that the Tribunal needed to consider it. Further, there was nothing before the Tribunal in the case before me on the issue of whether the authorities would tolerate or condone any such harm in the way as found to occur in the case of Mrs. Khawar."" 22 The Federal Magistrate concluded that none of the grounds pressed by the appellant were made out, and found no jurisdictional error by the Tribunal. 23 The notice of appeal, filed on 3 August 2005, contains three grounds of appeal. The appellant only seeks to rely on the first ground, which is that ""...in the circumstances of the [appellant's] case, these being that:- a. the harm which the appellant fears is from non-State agents. b. the evidence before the Tribunal was that the State was unwilling or unable to protect the applicant from harm for a Convention reason. c. the Convention reason relied on by the applicant was that the applicant is a member of a particular social group. d. the particular social group was 'victims of guerrilla groups'. [FM Nicholls erred in failing to find that]... the authority deriving from Applicant A ... is to be distinguished from that deriving from... Khawar... such that the harm which the applicant fears by reason of the failure of State protection is for a Convention reason."" 25 The appellant argues that even if the relevant particular social group is 'victims of guerrilla groups' (as found by the Tribunal and Magistrate), the lack of State protection of this group in the circumstances, and following Khawar , constitutes persecutory conduct for a Convention reason. 26 The appellant submits that the Tribunal misstated the persecution which was feared; that whilst the appellant feared harm from the guerrilla group, the persecutory conduct was the inability or unwillingness of the Columbian government to protect 'victims of guerrilla groups' as a group. The appellant observes that this was submitted by the appellant in his statement supporting his application to the Tribunal. 28 The appellant draws analogies with Khawar , arguing that the harm which was inflicted otherwise from non-State agents was tolerated or condoned by State authorities in a discriminatory manner, and that the persecutory conduct derives from a failure by the State to protect the group from harm. 29 The appellant submits both the Tribunal and the Magistrate erred in failing to consider this form of persecution, and incorrectly dealt with the application. The appellant submits that the Federal Magistrate erred in distinguishing Khawar in the way that he did, as the appellant's statement in support of his application to the Tribunal went directly to the State's unwillingness to intervene to protect victims of guerrilla groups. 31 In Khawar , the applicant feared domestic violence from her husband and his family, harm which, in itself, occurred for personal reasons and did not have a Convention nexus. The majority Justices accepted that, if the applicant could establish that the violence was tolerated and condoned by the authorities who selectively enforced the law so as not to provide protection to women, it would then become arguable that she faced persecution as a member of a ""particular social group"" (ie, women or perhaps married women being in a household which did not include a male blood relation to whom she could look for protection). 32 It follows from the reasons of the majority Justices in Khawar that where an applicant is at a real risk of harm at the hands of a non-State agent who is motivated by non-Convention reasons, but there is a failure of State protection motivated by a Convention reason, the necessary nexus between the persecution and the Convention is established. This is clearly expressed in the judgments of Gleeson CJ at [25] [26], McHugh and Gummow JJ at [84] [85] and [87] and Kirby J at [120] [121]. 35 Mr Archibald, for the appellant, seeks to add a further layer to the claim by expressing the group as victims of guerrillas whom the State could or would not protect. If the motivation of the State for its failure to provide protection is a Convention reason, the case would fall within the principle stated in Khawar."
Case9882,cited,Howard v Mechtler (1999) 30 ACSR 434,"first question is whether I am here concerned with a ""proceeding"" as defined in s 1322(1). Counsel for the BT defendants submit that the decision in Howard v Mechtler (1999) 30 ACSR 434 is authority for the proposition that a meeting or resolution passed at a meeting is such a proceeding. In that case Austin J certainly treated a meeting as being a proceeding for the purposes s 1322. However, I doubt whether, in declaring that the relevant resolution was ineffective by virtue of failure to comply with the equivalent of what is now s 201E , his Honour was acting pursuant to s 1322. Austin J raised that ground of invalidity after argument and received written submissions concerning it. His Honour's reasons suggest that he was declaring invalidity upon the basis of his construction of the relevant section rather than exercising a discretion to invalidate an otherwise valid resolution. The BT defendants also point out that in Cordiant Communications Australia Pty Ltd v The Communications Group Holdings Pty Ltd (2005) 55 ACSR 185 at [87], Palmer J observed: There is no doubt that the passing of a special resolution of a shareholders meeting is a ""proceeding"" under the Corporations Act for the purposes of s 1322. Apart from the plaintiffs' own assertions (which may be taken to be also on behalf of Contra Proferentum), there is no reason to believe that anybody would have voted differently had the two matters been voted upon separately. Nobody attending at the meeting, other than City Pacific and Contra Proferentum, opposed the proposal being considered and adopted in accordance with the notice of meeting. It is common ground that City Pacific and Contra Proferentum had insufficient votes to change the outcome. The plaintiffs bear the onus of establishing injustice for the purpose of s 1322(2). See Howard v Mechtler (1999) 30 ACSR 434 at 441. The plaintiffs have not satisfied that onus. Section 1322(4) Section 1322(4) will be engaged only if the purported resolution is invalid. The section authorizes the Court to make an order declaring that any act, matter or thing purporting to have been done, or any proceeding purporting to have been instituted or taken under the Act, or in relation to a corporation, is not invalid by reason of any contravention of a provision of the Act, or a provision of the constitution of a corporation. There is no reference to an act ""in relation to"" a scheme or a provision of the constitution of a scheme. However the purported resolution was clearly ""under"" the Act. It has not been suggested that any relief sought in connection with the purported resolution is beyond the power conferred by s 1322(4). In order that the Court may make an order pursuant to s 1322(4)(a) it must be satisfied as to one of the three following matters: In every case the Court must also be satisfied that no substantial injustice has been, or is likely to be, caused to any person. Presumably, the conferment of power to validate an act, matter, thing or proceeding which is ""essentially of a procedural nature"" supplements the power conferred by s 1322(2) to rectify a procedural irregularity, and therefore applies to a situation in which s 1322(2) would not operate. As I understand the BT defendants, they submit that it is just and equitable that an order be made validating any invalidity, and that no substantial injustice has been, or is likely to be, caused to any person."
Case3089,referred to,Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel [2000] FCA 62,"in mind matters of the kind referred to by Jacobs J in Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 15, courts ordinarily exercise some care before making an apportionment of costs of the kind the respondents seek. Thus, the Full Court in Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel [2000] FCA 62 at [4] declined to make such an order, upon the basis that: The appellant succeeded completely in terms of the final orders it secured. The issues it raised in argument on the appeal were not unreasonably raised. The somewhat complex factual background was a matter which had to be considered in relation to all issues. None of the issues raised can be characterised in terms of the time and work involved as distinct and severable from the other issues to the extent that an apportionment would be warranted. The applicant and the respondents all relied on this passage, pointing to different factors in their favour. In the present case, the key factor is that the applicant has not acted unreasonably in raising any issues in the context of the facts as they understood them."
Case2213,followed,Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Qld) (1987) 16 FCR 449,"As the Tribunal noted, a classifier of goods for the purpose of a customs tariff must look objectively at the goods in their condition as imported in order to identify objectively their classification for duty: Chinese Food and Wine Supplies v Collector of Customs (Vic) (1987) 72 ALR 591 at 599 per Lockhart J with whom Woodward and Ryan JJ agreed. The subjective intention of the manufacturer, exporter or importer is not relevant to this task. In Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Qld) (1987) 16 FCR 449 at 463, Morling and Wilcox JJ said that the classification of goods for tariff purposes was a practical, 'wharf-side' task. Morling and Wilcox JJ also said that the classifier had to consider the characteristics of the goods themselves as they would present to an informed observer. The heart of the exercise is to determine the essential character of the goods by reference to their state or condition at the time of importation ( Times Consultants 16 FCR at 462). Barton J said in Chandler &amp; Co v Collector of Customs [1907] HCA 81 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1719 at 1729: '... the dutiable classification of an imported article must be ascertained by an examination of the article itself, in the condition in which it is imported.' 38 As noted above, there were many references in the evidence about particular views of what an orthosis could be called. The Tribunal did not need to go through each of these explaining its conclusions about them. Its task, as the classifier, was to examine the goods in the condition in which they were imported and form its assessment of their essential character as an informed observer: Chandler 4 CLR at 1729 per Barton J; Times Consultants 16 FCR at 462 per Morling and Wilcox JJ."
Case1230,cited,Braganza v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 318 ; (2001) 109 FCR 364,"In relation to the second ground of appeal, which was added at the hearing, Mr Boccabella for the appellant submitted in summary as follows: &#8226; in Braganza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 318 ; (2001) 109 FCR 364, the Full Court held that, provided an application for waiver of a prescribed fee had been made within the prescribed period, the Tribunal could hear an application for review even if the waiver of the prescribed fee was refused &#8226; the decision not to waive the prescribed fee was actually made by a person called Mr Donohue rather than Mr Manal Hajaj (who was identified as the Authorised Officer on the letter from the Tribunal dated 28 January 2005) &#8226; no document signed by Mr Donohue and notifying the appellant of the decision not to waive the prescribed fee was actually sent by the Tribunal to the appellant &#8226; documents indicating that Mr Donohue was the actual decision maker were not disclosed to the appellant until the day of the hearing &#8226; the Tribunal was required to send out a letter under the authority of an authorised officer and the appellant then had 14 days to decide whether she could meet the fee waiver or not (TS p 11 ll 35-49 and p 12 ll 1-19) &#8226; it is not possible to tell from the document on which the actual decision-maker, Mr Donohue, indicated his decision, the reasons for that decision. First respondent's submissions 22 In summary the first respondent submitted the following: &#8226; it is yet to be established whether or not a decision which is unreasonable, in the sense explained in the Wednesbury case, is amenable to review for jurisdictional error in Australia. In any event, the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the conclusion reached by the Tribunal officer was a view which was reasonably open. This is correct and there is no prospect of Wednesbury unreasonableness, even assuming that Wednesbury unreasonableness does provide a separate ground of review &#8226; the primary submissions of the appellant as to the alleged failure of the Tribunal to take into account a relevant consideration, or taking into account an irrelevant consideration which it was bound not to take into account, is in reality an attack on the merits of the decision. There is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in making a wrong finding of fact. It is not the function of a court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion that the legislature has vested in the administrator: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 per Mason J at 39-40 &#8226; the evidence of the estranged partner's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context in which the decision-maker was making his decision. The appellant had applied for a Partner Visa based upon her de facto relationship with the estranged partner &#8226; it is permissible for the Tribunal to develop a form which sets out the matters it regards as relevant, provided the Court is satisfied that they are not clearly irrelevant &#8226; the task of the Tribunal's delegate on the application of the appellant was to achieve, on the evidence presented by the appellant, a state of satisfaction as to whether the payment of the fee required by the regulations had caused, or was likely to cause, severe financial hardship to the appellant. The findings made by the Tribunal's delegate were not only reasonably open on the evidence presented to him but were findings which he was required to make. The appellant's submission to the contrary is without foundation &#8226; whether the decision is a ""good"" decision or not is not the point - the question is whether it is officiated as a jurisdictional error &#8226; the facts of this case are not similar to those in WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 where the Full Court held that the Tribunal had disregarded documents that it was otherwise bound to consider if it surmised that it was possible that the documents could have been fabricated &#8226; the evidence of the estranged spouse's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context of an application for a Partner Visa based on a de-facto relationship with the estranged spouse &#8226; there is no statutory obligation to notify the appellant in any particular way, and no suggestion that the letter was not sent to the appellant's authorised recipient at the correct address. Although Mr Donohue may have been the ""authorised officer"" in relation to making the decision within the Regulations, Mr Hajaj was authorised to send the letter containing the decision. Nothing turns on the fact that the name ""Manal Hajaj"" appeared above ""authorised officer"" in letter to appellant &#8226; in relation to the form of notification of the Tribunal's decision to the appellant, Mr Bickford relied on the decision of Kiefel J in Sochorova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 817 where the applicant was before the Tribunal. In that case, although the applicant had previously been represented by solicitors, the hearing was conducted in the presence of the applicant, her brother and an interpreter. The Tribunal attempted to contact the applicant several days after the hearing to inform her of the decision, but was advised by the solicitors that they no longer acted for the applicant, and gave the Tribunal the last known telephone number and address of the applicant. It appears that the Tribunal contacted the applicant's brother by telephone and advised him orally of the decision on 21 August 2001. The applicant claimed that she was not notified of the decision until almost four months later. Kiefel J held that the applicant's brother was not her representative, and that advice to the applicant's brother was not notification to the applicant within the meaning of s 368D of the Migration Act . The applicant was first notified of the decision four months later, when she herself received a copy of the decision of the Tribunal, and that time began to run for an appeal from that point. However her Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, and held that the form of notification did not invalidate the actual decision of the Tribunal itself, because it did not follow either expressly or impliedly from construction of the Migration Act that such a consequence would follow (at [11]) &#8226; the significance of the decision of the Full Court in Braganza [2001] FCA 318 ; 109 FCR 364 is that in that case their Honours held that where an application for review of the Minister's decision and a request for fee waiver are made within the period prescribed by s 347(1) Migration Act , the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider the application for review provided that the application to set aside the Minister's decision is valid if made within the prescribed period and the fee is eventually paid or paid within a reasonable time after the waiver application is rejected (in particular at 375)."
Case3707,cited,Ayres v Evans (1981) 39 ALR 129; 56 FLR 235,"No forms of request are prescribed and there are no Regulations or Rules of Court setting out any procedural requirements. The general procedure has a long history (briefly reviewed by Fox J in Ayres v Evans (1981) 39 ALR 129; 56 FLR 235 at 239) but the details have varied over time. The complexities of modern cross-border insolvency make it likely that this beneficial provision will be exercised more in the future than it has been exercised in the past. Jersey is a prescribed country by reason of reg 3.01 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 . Therefore, the Court is obliged to act in aid of, and be auxiliary to, Jersey courts with jurisdiction in bankruptcy (s 29(2)(a) of the Act). A request pursuant to s 29(4) is not limited to the court of a prescribed country. Although there is no requirement to establish that it is likely that the foreign court will honour the request before the court should act under s 29(4) ( Clunies-Ross v Totterdell (1988) 20 FCR 358 at 361), the evidence establishes that the Royal Court of Jersey will so act."
Case24129,discussed,Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670,"A concern raised in previous scheme of arrangement applications in this Court is that shareholders may be left in a position, once a scheme has become effective, where their shares have been transferred but where there is a delay in the provision of the Scheme Consideration and where their only remedy is to sue on the deed poll (see Re KAZ Group Ltd [2004] FCA 738 at [4] - [5] ; Re Tempo Services Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 523 at [5]-[6]; Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 at [4] ; and Re Brambles Industries Ltd (2006) 59 ACSR 501 at [9]). Such ""performance risk"" has been addressed here by requiring that the Scheme Consideration be paid to APN before 8.00 am on the implementation date to be held by it in trust for the purpose of being paid, free of deductions, to the Scheme participants before they are divested of their shares in APN later on the implementation date. This is provided for in the Deed Poll. Disadvantages and Risks 43 Provisions for the payment of break fees are not uncommon in agreements for schemes of arrangements and in merger and takeover agreements, both in Australia and overseas. Such provisions have not been an obstacle to the making of orders under s 411(1) of the Act for the convening of meetings. In Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 at [6] - [7] , Gyles J said that he would be dissuaded from making an order by a break fee only if the amount was of such magnitude that it could influence voting or if there were some other unusual circumstances. 44 Break fees are justified by reference to: &#8226; the costs incurred by the offeror company; &#8226; the benefit that that company confers on the members of the target company by increasing its value; and &#8226; the desirability, from the viewpoint of those members, that takeover offers be made to them. 45 Clearly, a company making an approach to the board of a target company is entitled to stipulate as a term of its offer that the target company agree to a provision for a break fee. It is entitled to inform that board that if it does not agree to the break fee, the offer will not be made to the target company's shareholders, and it is entitled not to make the offer to the target's shareholders, if its board does not agree to the break fee. The question is what is the appropriate response of the target company's directors, and later of the Court."

Case5189,discussed,Hamilton v Piggott Wood &amp; Baker [2003] FCA 1055,"Hamilton v Piggott Wood &amp; Baker [2003] FCA 1055 , Heerey J made an order entitling a liquidator of an unregistered managed investment scheme to bring proceedings in his name as liquidator of the scheme. Heerey J was faced with the potential problem of two partners in a firm of solicitors who were administering the scheme being the plaintiffs as well as partners in the defendant firm. Heerey J observed at [8] that ""the provision for the winding up of an investment scheme cannot always be neatly fitted into the analogy of the winding up of a company"", an observation with which I agree. His Honour noted that the scheme itself was not a legal entity and could not be a plaintiff so he gave the liquidator leave to bring the proceeding in his name as liquidator of the scheme. His Honour did not consider the nature of the structure of the scheme. However, his Honour's conclusion is not inconsistent with the conclusion I have reached which is predicated on an understanding of the contractual foundation for the schemes. What is sought is an enabling order. In my view it is desirable that there be no doubt as to the ability of the liquidator to bring proceedings on behalf of the investors who constituted the syndicates which were the subject of the partnership agreement between Kastabon and Novena. All the proposed order will do procedurally is ensure that no challenge can be made to any proceeding brought by the liquidator on the ground that the entities which were the constituent and contracting entities which brought the schemes into existence are not properly parties to any such proceeding. I will therefore make an order in respect of each proceeding and each scheme in the following terms: Colin McIntosh Nicol is entitled to bring in the name 'Colin McIntosh Nicol as Liquidator of the Claremont Terrace Scheme' being the scheme defined in the schedule to the order made on 26 September 2005, any proceeding (as he may be advised) on behalf of the scheme and/or Kastabon Pty Ltd and/or Novena Holdings Pty Ltd (notwithstanding that it has been deregistered) against any person whether or not a party to this proceeding."

It is not the exercise of judicial power. It is part of an investigative procedure ... In my opinion it would not be appropriate for a Judge of the Federal Court to conduct examinations of an investigatory nature, and not truly judicial.' He transferred the matter, which was an application by a liquidator, to the Supreme Court of Victoria. The same characterisation of the examination process was made by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Friedrich v Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd [1990] VR 995 at 1003: '... essentially this procedure is administrative and does not result in judicial decisions as to any parties' rights, except decisions as to the manner in which the examination itself should be conducted.'"
Case7112,cited,St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147,"The main issue that was argued before me was whether, within the meaning of O 15A r 6, there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have the right to obtain relief from KPMG. On this question, some preliminary observations can be made: &#8226; It is necessary to examine the various elements of the potential cause of action that is sought to be relied upon to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that each of the necessary elements exist. That task requires the Court to conclude at least that there is a reasonable cause to believe that each of the elements of the relevant cause of action might be established. The test is an objective one, and it is not necessary to prove that each of the elements do in fact exist. The rule contemplates that there be reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have a right to obtain relief: see Austrac Operations Pty Ltd v New South Wales [2003] ATPR 41-960 at [11] and Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Page Kirkland Management Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 288 at [5] . &#8226; If the cause of action on which an application for preliminary discovery is based could not succeed, is bound to fail, is ill-founded or is doomed to fail, then discovery ought not be ordered: Bradley v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1989] 1 All ER 961 at 963 to 964; Harris v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Health Authority [1989] 2 All ER 273 at 277. If the potential cause of action would not survive an application for summary judgment pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ('Federal Court Act'), then discovery ought not to be ordered. &#8226; ""Belief"" under O 15A r 6 requires more than mere assertion, a ""hunch"", conjecture or suspicion. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition: see: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 at [13] to [14]; St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 154. &#8226; The availability of preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6 depends upon the evidence before the Court. . The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter of fact in question: see Austrac Operations [2003] ATPR at [37]; John Holland Services [2004] FCA at [13] to [14], [17] and [73] and St George v Rabo 211 ALR at 154. &#8226; The rule is one which should be construed beneficially. In Paxus Services Ltd v People Bank Pty Ltd (1990) 99 ALR 728 at 733 Burchett J said: It is no answer to the applicant's application under r 6 to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a fishing expedition: cf Meth v Norbert Steinhardt &amp; Son Ltd (1959) 33 ALJR 78 at 81. Rule 6 is designed to enable an applicant, in a situation where his proof can rise no higher than the level the rule describes, to ascertain whether he has a case against the prospective respondent -- that is, to ""fish"" in the old sense... It would be unfortunate if a rule designed to amplify the court's power to penetrate obscurities and uncertainties in the interests of justice were to be weakened by restrictive and unnecessary glosses. I think the rule is of a beneficial kind within the meaning of the well known principle of interpretation, and should be given the fullest scope its language will reasonably allow. The proper brake on any excesses in its use is the discretion of the court, which is required to be exercised in the particular circumstances of each case.

Case20384,applied,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar (2002) 210 CLR 1,"has been systematic, recent authoritative analysis of when conduct giving rise to a well founded fear of serious harm at the hands of a non-State actor may constitute persecution because of the unwillingness or inability of the State (or State agents) to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 222 CLR 1 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ; Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 ; see also SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448. I need only note the following for present purposes. It is drawn from the above authorities. (iv) If the State or its agents condone, approve, tolerate: Khawar , [31]; or are indifferent to: Respondents S152/2003 at [119]; the criminal conduct concerned, or are unwilling or unable to afford protection: Horvath at 510-511; Khawar , at [29] ... then the requirement that the persecution be by reason of one of the Convention grounds may be satisfied by the motivation of either the criminals or the state [or its agents]: Khawar, at [31]. (v) Proof merely of maladministration, incompetence or ineptitude of State agents would not convert personally motivated domestic violence into persecution on one of the grounds set out in Art 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention: Khawar at [26]. The issue in this appeal, as it was in Khawar and SZAIX , relates to proposition (iv) above. Having regard to what was said by members of the High Court in Khawar and in Respondents S152/2003 the Tribunal perceived its task to be that (Reasons [85]): I am required to consider whether the applicant has shown State Tolerance or condonation of domestic violence in Vanuatu. Further to that, or as part of that analysis, I am required to consider whether Vanuatu provides its citizens, or the members of the particular social group more specifically, with a reasonable level of protection from persecutory conduct. In assessing the level of protection offered, and assessing whether it is reasonable, I am required to assess that in accordance with international standards. I should at the outset deal with one factual circumstance in this matter which differs from the circumstances in Khawar (which also was a domestic violence case). In Khawar the abused woman went to the police on four occasions to report the violence and no action was taken by them. In the present matter the appellant, to quote the Tribunal, ""not once has ... sought the protection of the police to test [her] presumption"" (ie that the authorities would not provide her with a reasonable level of protection). Some significant, though unstated, importance appears to have been given to this failure: see Reasons [86]. If the Tribunal was suggesting that actually seeking the protection of the authorities was a prerequisite for a finding of absence of adequate State protection, then it clearly was in error. If cultural norms, practices or widely held assumptions in a particular society engender a reasonable apprehension that such an approach would only exaggerate a victim's predicament, I can see no conceivable reason why the law would require a victim to expose herself to likely future harm to substantiate that she was being persecuted for Convention purposes. This in turn leads to a larger issue which reveals what is a major silence in the Reasons. While the Tribunal was aware that Vanuatu was ""attempting to grapple with domestic violence"" and has pursued reforms in its laws and has instituted new mechanisms, the Reasons themselves engage in no explicit evaluation of the efficacy of those mechanisms or of the traditional cultural norms and practices which, both on the appellant's case and in light of the country information, might bear on the police's willingness or ability ""to take reasonable measures to protect the ... safety"" of victims of domestic violence. I would emphasise in this, for example, the evidence of the role of chiefs in settling family and domestic violence disputes and of the police's utilisation of the chiefs. The absence of evaluation I have noted seems the more surprising given the Tribunal's treatment of country information a treatment which simply diluted the potential significance of what the reports clearly were intending to convey. So the State Department report that ""courts occasionally prosecuted offenders using common-law assault"" is expressed as ""there are laws of general application against assault under which the perpetrators of domestic violence have been prosecuted"". Likewise the Tribunal's observation that the country information ""provides some support"" for the appellants information suggesting ""that the police are, in some circumstances, reluctant to intervene in domestic matters"", rather mutes, for example, the State Department's comment that ""police frequently were reluctant to intervene"" or Freedom House's comments to like effect."
Case12148,considered,Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41,"Mr Priestley submits that I should recuse myself from hearing this matter due to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Mr Priestley points to Deane J's statement in Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 74 where his Honour noted that one of the categories of disqualification by reason of appearance of bias was ' disqualification by interest... where some direct or indirect interest in the proceedings, whether pecuniary or otherwise, gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of prejudice '. Mr Priestley submits that I have an interest in the proceedings and that I am biased as a rule making judge of the Federal Court. 10 Further, it is Mr Priestley's submission that there is no judge presently sitting on the Federal Court who can sit on his case, either because that judge was also a rule making judge with respect to the impugned rule, or because the judge has applied s 31A of the Act. Although judges have been appointed to the bench since O 20 r 5 was passed, Mr Priestley submits that these judges are also biased as they have applied s 31A of the Act in their judgments. Mr Priestley says that would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of that judge because he or she has therefore been influenced by Parliament. 11 Mr Priestley proffers two alternatives to myself or any other judge of the Court hearing his matter. He submits that the matter could be referred to the High Court under s 40 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act ') and that he could apply for a writ of prohibition and ask the High Court to issue s 78B notices in order for the High Court to examine the constitutional validity of s 31A of the Act. The other alternative Mr Priestley proffers is that Parliament appoint a new judge to the Federal Court to sit on his case."
Case5576,considered,Law Society of New South Wales v Foreman (1994) 34 NSWLR 408,"ASIC's answer to this conundrum is to be found in eleven propositions to which I will refer later. At the heart of them is the proposition that where the inclusion of a particular term in a contract between a fiduciary and client would create an actual or potential conflict of interest between the fiduciary and the client, the fiduciary must obtain the client's informed consent to the inclusion of that provision. This approach to the question builds, in large measure, analogically upon principles applicable to solicitors: see in particular the observations of Mahoney JA in Law Society of New South Wales v Foreman (1994) 34 NSWLR 408 at 435-436. 20 The gravamen of ASIC's case is that for the exclusion of the fiduciary relationship in the mandate letter to be effective, it was incumbent upon Citigroup to draw Toll's attention expressly to the effect of the exclusion, that is, that it permitted Citigroup to trade in Patrick shares on its own account, in potential conflict with the interests of Toll. 298 A solicitor who wishes to enter into a time charging costs agreement with the client must make full disclosure to the client of all the implications of such an agreement: see Foreman at 435-437 per Mahoney JA; Re Morris Fletcher v Cross' Bill of Costs [1997] 2 Qd R 228 at 243 per Fryberg J; McNamara Business &amp; Property Law v Kasmeridis [2007] SASC 90 at [28] [31] per Doyle CJ. 300 In Foreman , Mahoney JA said at 435 that fiduciary obligations, including full disclosure, exist not only in the carrying out of an agreement already made between a solicitor and client ""but also in respect of the making of it."" 301 Mr Walker submitted that this observation by Mahoney JA indicates that the disclosure obligation applies to the making of a contract where a person who would otherwise be in a fiduciary relationship seeks to exclude fiduciary obligations in the terms of the contract. 302 However, I do not consider that this submission provides an answer to the conundrum presented by the apparent exclusion of the fiduciary relationship in the present case. There are two reasons for this. 304 Indeed, in Foreman at 435, Mahoney JA specifically pointed out that a solicitor is in a fiduciary position vis-&agrave;-vis the client and/or in a position of influence. Hence the need for the solicitor to give the client advice that would enable a proper understanding of the operation and effect of a time based costs agreement: see McNamara at [28] per Doyle CJ. 344 This submission is said to be based upon the principles stated in the authorities dealing with time charging by solicitors: see Foreman and the other authorities referred to at [298] [300] above. ASIC submitted that the principle is not limited to solicitors and applies generally to all fiduciaries. 345 However, for reasons given above at [303] [306], I do not consider that this principle applies in the present case. In particular, even if the principle stated by Mahoney JA in Foreman is of general application to fiduciaries, it cannot apply unless the fiduciary is within an established category or is subject to fiduciary obligations before entering into the contract. 346 To hold otherwise would be to say that a person who is not a fiduciary may nevertheless owe an obligation which flows from a fiduciary relationship. That could hardly be correct."
Case77,cited,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24,"It is well established that, in the absence of any express limitation in a statute, a consideration will be considered irrelevant only where there is ""in the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision-maker may legitimately have regard"": Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40 and the cases there cited. 34 I must focus upon the Act itself as a whole to determine whether there is some limitation on the power of the respondent. Whilst I am concerned with the interpretation of a Commonwealth Act, it must be recalled that I am concerned primarily with Pt IIA which deals with Victorian Aboriginal cultural heritage. The Act envisages that the Commonwealth Minister may delegate his powers to a state minister, which has occurred in this case. In my view, the Act envisages that a delegation could be made to the respondent in respect of the power to appoint inspectors in relation to Victorian Aboriginal cultural heritage, and envisages that the state minister be given the discretion to exercise the power in view of the specific needs in Victoria of Aboriginal cultural heritage. The question here is whether the Act imposes a limitation on the respondent so as to prevent him from adding the new criteria in considering the appointment suspension or removal of inspectors. If the new criteria are inconsistent with the scheme in respect of inspectors and s 21R, then putting aside any proposed legislation, taking into account the new criteria would necessarily be taking into account an irrelevant consideration. 35 The Act does not contain any express limitation on the exercise of the respondent's power to suspend and remove. As I have said, I accept that the Act gives prominence to the role of Aboriginal people in deciding what should occur in respect of areas and objects of importance to them. In appointing inspectors under s 21R, the respondent has an obligation to consult a local Aboriginal community, in an endeavour to appoint people with the appropriate expertise and knowledge, and to ascertain whether the person is able to perform the duties of an inspector. These criteria must be taken into account, but are not necessarily the only criteria to be applied. I do not regard these criteria as the exhaustive criteria to which the respondent may have regard. 36 Further, there is nothing which would defeat the purposes of the Act if no inspectors were appointed, or all inspectors were temporarily suspended, or even if they were all removed. Section 4 of the Act sets out its purposes, which purposes can obviously be fulfilled without the appointment of inspectors. The Act applies to areas and objects in Australia, not just to Victoria. Part IIA and the appointment of inspectors under the Act only applies to Victoria. Whilst the appointment of inspectors may further the purposes of the Act, they are not necessary for the implementation of such purposes generally. 37 The principal power given to an inspector is that conferred by s 21C; that is to make an emergency declaration. The Commonwealth Minister, the respondent, and any other delegates of the Commonwealth Minister or of the respondent may also exercise the power to make an emergency declaration, as may a magistrate (although only on application by a local Aboriginal community)."
Case3703,cited,Pongrass Group Operations Pty Ltd v Lowerpinems Pty Ltd (1994) 15 ACSR 341,"In support of its submissions on the question of whether there is a serious question to be tried in relation to the application for a stay, counsel for the applicant referred to the decision in Pongrass Group Operations Pty Ltd v Lowerpinems Pty Ltd (1994) 15 ACSR 341. In that case, Sackville J considered the principles applicable where it was proposed that a person who had a prior connection with the company be appointed as liquidator. At page 345, his Honour said: '...a proposal to appoint as a liquidator a person who has had a prior nexus with the relevant company should receive close scrutiny. It is also clear that due recognition should be given to the legitimate fears and perceptions of a substantial body of creditors. In this case, the wishes of Sensor Technologies Pty Ltd, as expressed by Mr Shearer ... should be taken into account. However, in my view, it is necessary to examine the evidence carefully and not to act on fears or suspicions that are not explained or justified by reference to underlying facts. Furthermore, it is relevant, although by no means decisive to take account of the advantages of continuity of administration if they apply in the circumstances of a particular case .'

Case1462,cited,SAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 65,"The third ground raised by the applicant was that the Tribunal did not adequately consider whether or not the State of Bangladesh had tolerated, condoned or was complicit in the criminal activities of Mohammed Ali and his associates. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal had therefore failed to deal with the integers of the applicant's claim, thereby constituting a jurisdictional error: Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244 at 259 [42]; W396/01 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 69 at [31]-[38]; SAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 65 at [40] . The applicant contended that the criminal activities directed at his family were instigated, and were successful, because the criminals knew that the State would fail to offer protection to the applicant and his family due to their Pakistani ethnicity. The applicant complained that there was evidence before the Tribunal of the State's tolerance and complicity in the criminal activity perpetrated against his family and himself because of their ethnicity."
Case21777,followed,Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076,"There was no dispute between the parties as to the principles which govern the imposition of a penalty under s 76(1). The relevant principles have been discussed at length in numerous cases: see Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 ( 'CSR' ) at 52,151 52,153 per French J; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 ( 'NW Frozen Foods' ) at 291-295 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ; Schneider Electric (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 2 ; (2003) 127 FCR 170 at 172 173 [2]-[6] per Sackville J and at 181 184 [47]-[60] per Merkel J; J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2000) 172 ALR 532 ( 'McPhee' ) at 577-579 [158]-[166]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 564 ( 'Visy Paper (No 2)' ) at 571-572 [28]-[32] per Sackville J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2 ) (2005) 215 ALR 281 at 283 285 [5]-[12] per Merkel J; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) (2005) 215 ALR 301 ( 'Leahy (No 3)' ) at 307-311 [31]-[43] per Goldberg J. 10 In CSR at 52,152 52,153, French J identified six additional factors: (i) the size of the contravening company; (ii) the degree of its power, evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; (iii) the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended; (iv) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level; (v) whether the company had a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the TPA, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and (vi) whether the company has shown a disposition to cooperate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the TPA in relation to the contravention. These factors were approved by Burchett and Kiefel JJ, with whom Carr J agreed, in NW Frozen Foods at 292. 13 Deterrence is the principal object of the penalties regime. In CSR at 52,152, French J said that the principal, and he thought probably the only, object of the penalties imposed by s 76 is to attempt to put a price on contravention that is sufficiently high to deter repetition by the contravener and by others who might be tempted to contravene the TPA. His Honour also observed that it is conducive to deterrence to adopt an approach under which the greater the scope and impact of the conduct, the heavier the penalty should be: at 52,153. 14 In NW Frozen Foods at 293 295, Burchett and Kiefel JJ said that the deterrent effect of a penalty, both specific and general, is an important factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate penalty in a particular case, although it must also be borne in mind that the penalty should not be so great as to be oppressive. 60 The ACCC said that the existence of a trade practices compliance program was 'possibly relevant' to the determination of penalty. I do not see any need for the qualification added by the ACCC. In my opinion, the introduction of a compliance program in 2004, and its continuing operation, is a relevant factor in determining penalty: see CSR per French J at 52,123; and NW Frozen Foods at 293-294 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ. In Rural Press at 43,291 [22], Mansfield J said: 'The fact that, following a contravention, a contravening entity has implemented at its own expense a trade practices compliance program to ensure its compliance and that of its employees and agents with the Act, will also be a consideration which will mitigate the level of a pecuniary penalty: NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner (1997) ATPR |P41-546; (1996) 141 ALR 640...; Prestige Motors . Such conduct gives some confidence that the particular contravener will not engage in similar conduct in the future, and it may also be assumed would come to the knowledge of the community through the reasons given when fixing penalty, so as also to serve the purpose of community deterrence.' I agree with these observations."

His Honour noted first, that s 85A(1) is intended to remove the expectation that costs will follow the event but that despite this, the Court retains its discretion as to costs unlimited by subrule (1); secondly the ""unreasonable conduct"" of the parties is not a jurisdictional fact which preconditions the exercise of the discretion and, conversely, s 85A(2) will not control or limit the discretion in subrule (1); thirdly, whilst the exercise of the discretion when making a costs order should be judicial, the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs."
Case10224,cited,Harris v Caladine [1991] HCA 9 ; (1991) 172 CLR 84,"Neither submission should be accepted. The power of the District Registrar to determine or review (or ""confirm, increase or reduce"") the Liquidator's remuneration and expenses comes from the Court's powers under s 473(3) and (5) of the Corporations Act . A power of the Court may be delegated to a Registrar by Rules of Court: Federal Court of Australia Act 1974 (Cth) s 35A(1)(h).

Case23156,considered,Kowadlo v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 786,"Counsel for the Commissioner helpfully referred me to a number of authorities where the Tribunal has reviewed the discretion of the Commissioner under s 298- 20 : &#8226; In Hobart Central Child Care Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 1027 ; 2005 ATC 2351 where the Commissioner took the view that tax shortfalls resulting from subsequently disallowed deductions were caused by the taxpayer's intentional disregard of the law, and a penalty was imposed, the Tribunal found that there were no grounds for remitting the penalties under s 298- 20 . The Tribunal said: ""Section 298- 20 of Schedule 1 to the TA Act provides that the Commissioner may remit all or part of a penalty. It does not set out any guidelines as governing the exercise of the discretion. Given the provisions relating to the imposition of penalties, there would clearly need to be circumstances that could be regarded as mitigating the taxpayer's behaviour in some way while bearing in mind the purpose for which the income tax is imposed and paid and the role of the ITA Act and TA Act in supporting that purpose. I am satisfied that there are no circumstances that mitigate those in which HCCC finds itself."" (at 2,385) &#8226; In Otway Pastoral Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 649 ; 2005 ATC 2219 the taxpayer had failed to lodge quarterly BASs on time for the periods ending 30 June 2001 through to 30 September 2003, and finally lodged them in early December 2003. The Tribunal stated that the remission power should only be granted where special circumstances exist (at 2221). It found that the failure to lodge the BASs by the due dates was due to factors outside the control of the taxpayer, namely the failure of the taxpayer's bookkeeper to discharge her duties and to disclose such failure, and the unavoidable absence (due to a stroke) of the manager employed by the taxpayer to supervise the bookkeeper's activities. The Tribunal was satisfied that the combination of factors was unusual and represented special circumstances. In relation to the claim of the taxpayer that the absence of a manager coupled with drought conditions, loss of stock and the cumulative cost of penalties would leave it in a very difficult financial position, the Tribunal noted that: ""While not necessarily a special circumstance, the general financial losses caused by the mishaps to the farm manager also have some relevance to this decision.""(at 2222) &#8226; In Kowadlo v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 786 the taxpayers' returns for the year ended 30 June 2002 were lodged late and a penalty was imposed. The Tribunal noted that returns for each of the three prior years were lodged late without penalty, but found: ""As stated on behalf of (the Commissioner), the penalty regime is to penalise non-compliance with the requirements of the legislation. Loss of revenue is not the issue. While particular and unexpected problems of a tax agent may be appropriate grounds for remission of all or part of a penalty, I am of the opinion here that the consistent late lodgement of returns by the applicants without prior penalties has allowed already any appropriate remission. If the late lodgement is entirely the fault of the tax agent, and I had no clear evidence that it was, this is a matter between the tax agent and his client. I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that there is justification for any remission of the penalty.""(at [10]) &#8226; In Re Taxpayer v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 696 ; (2005) 60 ATR 1129 the Commissioner took the view that the taxpayer was not entitled to claim GST input credits in the relevant circumstances, and because the case involved intentional disregard of a taxation law, imposed a penalty of 75% under Div 284. The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Commissioner not to remit the penalty or any part thereof in circumstances where the taxpayer had intentionally understated tax or knowingly over-claimed a credit. &#8226; In Re William Vazquez &amp; Associates v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 301 ; (2005) 58 ATR 1357 where a director of the taxpayer said that the taxpayer did not have the funds to make payment of outstanding amounts, and that he had been of the mistaken belief as to the time payments were due to be made, the Commissioner imposed a penalty for late lodgement. In allowing partial remission of the penalty on the basis that the penalty was excessive, it is useful to note the following comments of the Tribunal: ""[14] Although the penalty imposed is described as an 'administrative penalty' it is still a penalty and normal sentencing principles must be kept in mind when exercising the discretion as to whether to mitigate the penalty of not. In particular apart from circumstances peculiar to the individual offending taxpayer the threefold purposes of punishment must be kept in mind. Those purposes are retribution, deterrence and reformation. In particular, see the discussion of sentencing principles in R v Kane [1974] VR 759 at 764-765. ... [26] At para 98.5.3 of [the ATO receivables policy document] it is stated that in determining penalty the Commissioner will have regard to the lodgement history of the taxpayer and the effort taken by the Tax Office to obtain lodgement. ... [28] In seeking to apply those principles to the individual circumstances of this taxpayer, I do not regard them as either derogating from or adding to general principles regarding mitigation of penalty. [29] Notwithstanding the comments in Re Kowadlo and FCT [2004] AATA 786 , I do regard any loss or potential loss or revenue as being part of the matrix of factors affecting a decision whether to remit penalty or not. [30] I accept that the applicant, by its directors was under a mistaken belief that payment had to accompany lodgement. What detracts from any mitigating factor is that the applicant made no attempt to contact the ATO and explain its difficulties and seek some arrangement. Further, even when 2 reminder letters were sent the approach of the directors of the company seems to have been one of ignoring the problem in the hope that it would go away. [31] On the other hand, there has apparently been no prior or subsequent breach. The company is apparently viable but subject to fluctuations in its income... [32] Quite clearly, the applicant has learnt a salutary lesson that time constrains must be obeyed and that difficulties with returns should be negotiated with the respondent at the outset. This can be classed as reformation. [33] So far as retribution and general deterrence are concerned, no doubt the applicant and its accountants and directors are now aware of the late lodgement provisions and will make others aware."" &#8226; In Re Kizquart Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 582 ; (2005) 60 ATR 1112, the Tribunal followed Vazquez and found that in determining whether the discretion to mitigate should be exercised, normal sentencing principles should be taken into account (at 1116). In finding that the amount of the penalty was excessive, the Tribunal found it relevant that: o the taxpayer had reformed his practice and no longer lodged his statements late, and accordingly it was not necessary to punish him for his inadvertent failure in view of his difficulties during the period in question (at 1116) o there had not been any actual loss or realistically any potential loss of revenue which might affect a decision whether to remit penalty o the late lodgements were caused by a combination of the taxpayer's failure to understand the new system, pressure of work and personal difficulties, all factors amounting to a delay caused by circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer o the taxpayer had a good tax record and contacted the ATO once he recognised that he had not understood his obligations. 42 As the Commissioner noted in his submissions, Hobart Central Child Care [2005] AATA 1027 ; 2005 ATC 2351, Otway Pastoral Pty Ltd [2005] AATA 649 ; 2005 ATC 2219, Kowadlo [2004] AATA 786 and Taxpayer v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 696 ; 60 ATR 1129 are consistent with the Commissioner's submissions as to the factors to which a decision-maker may have regard in relation to the exercise of the remission discretion, whereas William Vazquez [2005] AATA 301 ; 58 ATR 1357 and Kizquart [2005] AATA 582 ; 60 ATR 1112 are not."
Case15781,considered,Morris v Hanley [2001] NSWCA 374,"In Morris v Hanley [2001] NSWCA 374 , Heydon JA (with whom Foster and Rolfe AJJA agreed) said, at par 22: '[22] The duty of judges is to give reasons for the directions and orders they make must be lower where interlocutory orders affecting matters of practice and procedure are involved than they are where orders are made after a trial. That must be so if for no other reason than that litigation would clog up to the point of stagnation if full reasons had to be given for the tens or hundreds of interlocutory orders which many primary judges make in a week in busy trial courts. However, though applications for security for costs are matters of practice and procedure, they can have a significant impact on the substantive rights of plaintiffs, because if the order is made, the plaintiff may not be able to provide security for costs where one of the grounds for the application is that plaintiff's lack of funds. If so, that will prevent the plaintiff being able to have a judicial examination of the complaints made on the merits. Accordingly it would not be right to hold that there is no duty, or only a very exiguous duty, on a primary judge to give reasons for making an order as to security for costs. [23] The primary judge in giving his reasons for the orders under appeal in many respects went well beyond what was called for by the duty to give reasons. The reasons for judgment he provided, particularly given that they were ex tempore, set out in considerable detail his approach. However, there is force in the argument of the plaintiff that insufficient reasons were given in relation to the question of the defendants' delay ... [24] ... Sometimes what might otherwise be said to be a deficiency in the reasons of a primary judge can be compensated for by a clear explanation in the course of argument by the primary judge for the outcome. However, that cure cannot be resorted to here. This Court does not have before it any transcript of the oral argument before the primary judge, and it has before it no affidavit indicating anything he may have said in the course of argument which would explain how he took the defendants' delay into account. [25] In those circumstances there is an error of principle in the primary judge's approach. 18 It seems to me that what was held to be, in that case, a failure to give adequate reasons must be the 'high water mark' of a judge's obligation to give reasons for interlocutory orders. I think there is room for the view that there was a desired result on the appeal searching for a reason to make it. 19 In my opinion, it is cases like Morris v Hanley [2001] NSWCA 374 that support the view of trial judges that appellate judges can be likened to those who come down out of the hills after the battle is over and shoot the wounded. 20 Nevertheless it is clear that, even on interlocutory orders, there is a duty to give adequate reasons, which do not display error. 21 It is sufficient in respect of other aspects of the application for leave to indicate that in my opinion it is arguable that the conclusion of the primary judge in dismissing the application for security was tainted by misapplication of principle, and an improper interpretation of s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In particular, it is arguable that principles dealing with the impecuniosity of a plaintiff who is a natural person, have no application in relation to corporations falling within s 1335."

The appellants relied on their evidence and that of Graham [their land agent who acted for them] in order to show that the assessments were excessive. Once that evidence was rejected, the appellants' case necessarily failed. The Act does not place any onus on the Commissioner to show that the assessments were correctly made. Nor is there any statutory requirement that the assessments should be sustained or supported by evidence. The implication of such a requirement would be inconsistent with s. 190(b) for it is a consequence of that provision that unless the appellant shows by evidence that the assessment is incorrect, it will prevail."" The view expressed by Mason J in this passage has been endorsed: see McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284, esp at 302-304 (Gibbs J), 306 (Stephen J), 323 (Murphy J); Macmine Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1979) 53 ALJR 362, esp at 371 (Stephen J), 381 (Murphy J); Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco [1990] HCA 3 ; (1990) 168 CLR 614 esp at 624-5 (Brennan J with whom Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh agreed, and Deane J generally agreed) ("" Dalco "").

Case20088,cited,SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034,"There is, moreover, a second reason for rejecting the appellant's arguments based on s 424A. In my opinion, if any material in the protection visa application was relied upon by the Tribunal as a basis for its findings concerning inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence and its adverse finding on his credibility, that material was republished by the letter accompanying the application to the Tribunal. I have already referred to the content of that letter. The appellant's letter incorporates, in my view, the substantive claims made in the appellant's statutory declaration which supported his application for a protection visa. It follows that the information in the protection visa application became information given by the appellant to the Tribunal within the meaning of subs (3)(b) of s 424A. This view is supported by the authorities: see M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 ; VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 ; and SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034."
Case1361,applied,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 22 However, the fact that in realising the asset the taxpayer has engaged in activities which were planned, organised and coherent, and which produced profits considerably more than could otherwise have been obtained, does not mean that an advantageous realisation converts into a profit-making scheme: Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188, Gibbs CJ in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 369. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in Williams 127 CLR per Barwick CJ at 240-241, Menzies J at 245, Gibbs J at 249-251, Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR 95 and Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997). Relevance of purpose 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 30 In identifying the purpose of a corporate taxpayer, it is important indeed decisive to consider the purpose of those who control the taxpayer: Ruhamah 41 CLR at 160, 162, 166; Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 370. So, for example, in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 where ownership and control of the taxpayer company changed from that of individuals whose purpose in forming the taxpayer was for the taxpayer to hold land for the domestic purposes of those shareholders, to that of three companies which acquired the taxpayer for the purpose of carrying out a business operation of land development, a key issue in the decision was the fact of that change of control and the intentions of the new shareholders of the taxpayer. 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient."
Case74,cited,Jarratt v Commissioner of Police (NSW) [2005] HCA 50 ; (2005) 224 CLR 44,"I am prepared to assume for the purposes of this case that natural justice or procedural fairness needed to be accorded to each applicant. The real question to determine is the practical content of natural justice or procedural fairness in this case: see, e.g. Jarratt v Commissioner of Police (NSW) [2005] HCA 50 ; (2005) 224 CLR 44 at 51 per Gleeson CJ."
Case13754,cited,Vaitaiki v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1998) 150 ALR 608,"In his Statement of Reasons, the Minister refers to the children cumulatively, singling out only one child (Darryl Holani). This in itself would not necessarily mean that the Minister has not taken into account the best interests of each of the applicant's children, in particular Larni and Joshua as submitted by the applicant, if the reasons of the Minister indicated that their interests had been taken into account: cf Mason CJ and Deane J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 292; Burchett J in Vaitaiki v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1998) 150 ALR 608 at 614, Lei Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 at [283] . Primary consideration 22 In his Statement of Reasons, the Minister states that he gave primary consideration to the best interests of the children and that he gave that consideration ""substantial weight"". The weight given by the Minister to a relevant factor can not be the subject of judicial review: Taylor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 208 at [19] . However the issue of whether the Minister actually undertook the task is a matter for this Court. As noted by Toohey J in Turner v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 35 ALR 388 at 392: ""In many cases it will be clear whether or not the decision maker has taken a relevant consideration into account. That is not to say that the mere assertion by the decision maker that he has done so will conclude the matter. It may be possible to demonstrate from a consideration of all the reasons leading to the decision, or indeed from the decision itself, that a consideration has not been taken into account in any real sense. Conversely the omission of an express reference to some consideration will not lead inevitably to a conclusion that it was not taken into account. An examination of the reasons for decision and of the decision itself may justify the inference that it was ."" (emphasis added) (cf Branson J in Vaitaiki 150 ALR at 631) 23 The key issue in this case is whether, in making findings concerning the best interests of Larni and Joshua, the Minister has in fact given the best interests of the children ""proper, genuine and realistic consideration"" (Branson J in Vaitaiki 150 ALR at 631; Branson, North and Stone JJ in Lei Wan [2001] FCA 568 at [34] ). Material before the Minister 30 In my view this not a case where the interests of Larni and Joshua are ""dismissed with...almost perfunctory curtness"" (cf Burchett J in Vaitaiki 150 ALR at 614). Further, this is not a case where the Minister has failed to identify anywhere in his Statement of Reasons what the best interests of the children indicated that he should decide with respect to the applicant's visa (cf Branson, North and Stone JJ in Lei Wan [2001] FCA 568 at [26] - [27] ): the Minister clearly stated that the best interests of the children required that the applicant's visa not be cancelled. The only real information of relevance before the Minister concerning Larni and Joshua other than their ages concerned their close relationship with their father and the support he provided them, and this issue was clearly taken into account."
Case18152,cited,Cummings v Lewis (1993) 41 FCR 599,"Ordinarily, if a successful party is denied an order for costs in whole or part, it is because of its conduct of the proceeding in some respect or respects. In Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) at 236, Black CJ and French J said: ""Within the general discretion to award costs, costs may be refused where, for example, the applicant has made an exaggerated claim which has occupied a significant proportion of the proceedings and has succeeded only on a minor aspect of its original claim. Costs may be apportioned according to success or failure on particular distinct or severable issues ... . And a trial judge may award only a proportion of the successful party's costs if the conduct of that party at trial was such as to unreasonably prolong the proceedings ...."" (Citations omitted) The ordinary costs order in favour of a successful party is not made where, by reason of the successful party's conduct, it would not be just and reasonable to do so: see, e.g., Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 544 per Mason CJ and Cummings v Lewis (1993) 41 FCR 599 at 603 per Cooper J (with whom Sheppard and Neaves JJ generally agreed)."

In National Union of Workers v Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; (2001) 108 FCR 90, Weinberg J at [50] observed: 'By virtue of the operation of s 298V, it is presumed in proceedings brought under s 298K, that the conduct was, or is being, carried out for a prohibited reason unless the respondent proves otherwise' . See also Wilcox J, Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal, Administrative and Clerical Services Union (supra) at [122] and Patrick Stevedores Operations No. 2 Proprietary Limited &amp; Ors v Maritime Union of Australia &amp; Ors (1998 1999) [1998] HCA 30 ; 195 CLR 1 per Gaudron J at [123]. Finally, in Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd (1976) 26 FLR 257 at 267, Northrop J considered the operation of s 5(4) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1975 (Cth) which provided that in any proceeding for an offence against the section, if all the facts and circumstances constituting the offence, other than the reason for the defendant's action, are proved, it shall lie upon the defendant to prove that he was not actuated by the reason alleged in the charge and observed: 'The circumstances by reason of which an employer may take action against an employee are, of necessity, peculiarly within the knowledge of the employer. It is for this reason that s 5(4) is of such importance it has the effect of shifting the onus of proof to the employer with the result that the employer is obliged to prove a negative if he is to avoid being found guilty of the offence charged if all the other facts and circumstances constituting the offence are proved. The onus so cast upon the employer is to prove a negative on a preponderance of probabilities'. 351 The respondents further rely upon Heidt v Chrysler Australia (supra) and National Union of Workers of Qenos Pty Ltd (supra) as authority for the proposition that there must be demonstrated ""differential treatment"" by an employer as against an individual employee or other person or an identified class of persons as against others. The decision in Heidt v Chrysler (supra) concerned a challenge to the dismissal of an employee on grounds that the dismissal was actuated by reason of the employee's membership of the Union, his entitlement to an award and his membership of a Union that was seeking better conditions about which he was dissatisfied. The respondents rely upon this passage from the judgment of Northrop J at page 270: 'Counsel for the informant did not argue that the defendant had failed to prove that, in dismissing the informant, it had not been actuated by reason of either of the circumstances that the informant was a member of an organisation or was entitled to the benefit of an award. To so argue would have been futile. It was a condition of his employment by the defendant that the informant become and remain a member of the organisation. The award was binding on the defendant with respect to all employees coming within the scope of the award, whether members of the organisation or not. I find that the defendant, in dismissing the informant, was not actuated by reason of the circumstance that the informant was a member of an organisation, nor by reason of the circumstance that the informant was entitled to the benefit of an ward.'"

The approach may be summarised in six points, as follows: (1) first, identify the relevant section or sections of the public by reference to which the issue is to be tested. The target section or sections of the public would, of course, vary according to the facts of each case: Parkdale at 209 per Mason J; Finucane v New South Wales Egg Corp (1988) 80 ALR 486 at 516. The relevant section or sections of the public may be confined by factors such as the time period over which the alleged representations were made and the geographical circulation of the advertisements containing the alleged representations. (For an example of geographical circulation defining the relevant test section, see Talmax Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [1997] 2 Qd R 444 at 446); (2) second, having identified the relevant section or sections of the public, consider who comes within that section or those sections. This may include the astute and the gullible, the intelligent and the not so intelligent, the well educated and the poorly educated: see also Parkdale at 199 per Gibbs CJ; (3) third, it is permissible, but not essential, to have regard to evidence that some person has in fact been misled, though this evidence will not be conclusive; (4) fourth, it is necessary to enquire whether any proven misconception has arisen because of the misleading or deceptive conduct; (5) fifth, where the persons alleged to have been misled are members of a class, it is necessary to isolate a representative member of the class and enquire whether that hypothetical person is likely to be deceived; (6) sixth, when considering the likely effect of the misrepresentation on this hypothetical person, he or she should be judged as an ""ordinary"" or ""reasonable"" member of the class, excluding reactions to the representation that are ""extreme"" or ""fanciful""."

At [41] to [46] of its reasons, the Tribunal gave careful consideration to the appellants' ability to relocate within India. In those paragraphs of its reasons, the Tribunal gave express consideration to the practicalities of the appellants relocating in light of the husband's personal situation and circumstances (including his previously demonstrated ability to relocate within India), as well as his financial resources, skills and knowledge. The Federal Magistrate noted that the findings and reasons of the Tribunal did not manifest a misunderstanding or a misapplication of the relevant principles. In my judgment, the Federal Magistrate was correct when she expressed this conclusion, and there was no error in the approach of the Tribunal in dealing with relocation. Ground 3 was also advanced before the Federal Magistrate. The Federal Magistrate noted that the Tribunal concluded that it could not be satisfied that there was a real chance of persecution of the husband in the foreseeable future by members of the BJP elsewhere in India. Her Honour said that it was open to the Tribunal to prefer the country information where the husband's evidence differed from it. At the beginning of its reasons for decision, the Tribunal set out the law relating to the real chance test which is related to the concept of a well-founded fear for a Convention reason. In my judgment, it correctly articulated the relevant principles. In substance, the complaint under Ground 3 is a complaint that the Tribunal came to the wrong view on the facts. In my judgment, there is no error disclosed in the Tribunal's decision and, in particular, no error which could be characterised as jurisdictional error. Accordingly, Ground 3 has not been made out. For these reasons, there has been no error on the part of the Federal Magistrate demonstrated by the appellants, nor have they been able to demonstrate jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.

Case9659,cited,Salim v Loh [2005] FCA 372,"The progress of this application, and other related applications, to trial has been chequered. That history is described by French J in a decision dated 6 April 2005 ( Salim v Loh [2005] FCA 372). On that occasion French J heard an application by the respondents for the relief which included, the striking out of the statement of claim as it then existed. In his reasons, French J referred to the fact that there had been several previous attempts made to plead a statement of claim and he said at [38]: 'I have a considerable degree of sympathy for the respondents in facing the task of pleading to the [substituted statement of claim] and its proposed successor, the amended [substituted statement of claim] . Some parts use language whose meaning and construction is at best illusive. I fear however, that taking a scalpel to particular paragraphs will simply inflate the expense and delay involved in a proceeding which should have been heard and determined some time ago. It is, in my opinion, necessary to find a way forward in the management of this case that does not involve further undue expense and delay. I propose therefore to allow the applicant's pleading to stand. The amended [substituted statement of claim] may be substituted for it. It will stand as a statement of the applicant's contentions of fact and law. However I will dispense with further pleadings. The respondents will not be required to plead to the amended, [substituted statement of claim] . That, I think, is too onerous a task, given its shortcomings. Rather I will require the respondents to file statements of the contentions of fact and law upon which they each rely in answer to the applicant's case. This will not require them to address the amended [substituted statement of claim] in the way that they would be required to if pleading a formal defence.' 3 French J went on to say at [39]: 'I propose thereafter, consistently with directions previously given in relation to the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court, that the trial of the action be on affidavit and/or by the tender of written statements sworn to or affirmed by witnesses called by the parties. Thus the applicant will be required to file all his affidavits and/or witness statements to be relied first and so to disclose the entirety of his case.' 4 French J's comments and directions referred to above, applied both to this application and to a related application, namely WAD 9 of 2004. In application WAD 9 of 2004, the son of the applicants in this application, Iwan Salim, also known as John Salim, seeks relief founded on claims that he was induced to invest monies in a project carried out by the fifth respondent, which I will call the 'ostrich scheme', by misleading and deceptive conduct engaged in by and on behalf of the fifth respondent. 5 In accordance with the directions of French J referred to above, the applicants in this case filed witness statements dated 5 December 2005. It was in response to the filing of those witness statements that this application for summary judgment was brought. 6 The applicants' claims against the third respondent in this application are based upon allegations of the accessorial liability of that respondent for the misleading and deceptive conduct of the fifth respondent. It is alleged that the third respondent was at all material times a director of the fifth respondent. The third respondent submits that as a consequence of the filing of the applicants' witness statements it is now clear that there is no reasonable cause of action disclosed in respect of the claims by the applicants based on misleading and deceptive conduct. 7 The third respondent submits that a perusal of the witness statements shows that there was no conveyance of any representation which was made by or on behalf of the fifth respondent to the applicants, who, as I have said, are the parents of the applicant in WAD 9 of 2004. Further, it is said that there was no evidence that the applicants relied on any representations allegedly made by or on behalf of the fifth respondent. It is also argued that the applicants are precluded from bringing a claim because they suffered no loss. In this regard, the third respondent submits that the applicants' witness statements disclose that the money which was provided for the investment in the ostrich scheme and which was paid to the fifth respondent for that purpose, was paid by the son and not the applicants."

Case15723,cited,Yorkshire Regional Health Authority v Fairclough Building Ltd [1996] 1 All ER 519,"In Yorkshire Regional Health Authority v Fairclough Building Ltd [1996] 1 All ER 519, the United Kingdom Court of Appeal considered the meaning of a ""new claim"" in s 35(2) of the Limitation Act 1980 (UK) and O 15 r 7 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (UK) as those provisions then provided. Order 15 r 7 relevantly provided: '(1) Where a party to an action dies or becomes bankrupt but the cause of action survives, the action shall not abate by reason of the death or bankruptcy. (2) Where at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter the interest or liability of any party is assigned or transmitted to or devolves upon some other person, the Court may, if it thinks it necessary in order to ensure that all matters in dispute in the cause or matter may be effectively and completely determined and adjudicated upon, order that other person to be made a party to the cause or matter and the proceedings to be carried on as if he had been substituted for the first mentioned party.' 47 The Court observed that the rule of court, which is cast in similar but not identical terms to O 6 r 10 of the Rules contains no reference to limitation and commented '[t] his is as it should be, since the circumstances in which the rule may be invoked do not give rise to any question of limitation ' (at 523). The Court recognised that the new party is substituted because he or she has succeeded to a claim or liability already represented in the action and sues or is sued in respect of the existing cause of action. It concluded that ' the expiry of the limitation period is completely irrelevant ' (at 523). While the English O 15 r 7 specifically provided for ' the proceedings to be carried on as if he had been substituted for the first mentioned party ' and those words are not present in O 6 r 10 of the Rules, the logic of the Court of Appeal is persuasive."
Case4656,cited,Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Miyamoto [2003] FCA 812,"It is not uncommon, particularly, but not only, in intellectual property cases, for the court to take as its starting point the evidence of the charges for professional costs incurred and disbursements made by the lawyers of the party awarded costs and this irrespective of whether the costs are to be estimated on an indemnity basis: cf Beach Petroleum NL at 120; or on a party and party basis: cf Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Miyamoto [2003] FCA 812 at [29] ff. That figure is then characteristically adjusted to take account of the acceptability of the charges made, the conduct of the proceeding, the measure of success on issues etc, to produce a sum which as a matter of judgment is neither overcompensatory nor prejudicial to the successful party. Consistent with the broad brush approach, that adjustment ordinarily is effected through the application of a discount to the figure accepted by the court on the available evidence as appropriately reflecting actual professional costs charged and disbursements made. The case law evidences wide variations in the percentages of discount sought and/or applied to reflect the exigencies of the matter in question: cf Sony Entertainment (Australia) , 60%; Beach Petroleum NL , 39%, Nine Films &amp; Television , 23%. What is clear is that a lump sum award may be in an amount that is greater or smaller than would have been the taxed costs payable: see Dal Pont at [15.20]."

Case9373,cited,(2005) 87 ALD 357,"The appellant submitted that this statement only applied to the statutory declaration and not to the contents of the protection visa application. He further submitted that it could not be taken to refer to the material which was provided during the course of the previous Tribunal matter, such as the document titled ""Background"".

Here, it was submitted, the only express written reference was to the statutory declaration attached to the protection visa application and perhaps, on a generous reading, the submissions in support of the visa application. The appellant submitted that the Federal Magistrate therefore erred by applying s 424A(3)(b) to material other than the statutory declaration. 24 The respondent submitted that there was no error in the Federal Magistrate's analysis of the treatment of the documents forwarded to the Tribunal by the appellant's lawyers (including the document titled ""Background"").

Case21867,followed,Dai v Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman [2000] FCA 717,"On 28 November 2005, the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal, a draft notice of appeal and supporting affidavit the application that is now before this Court (together the 'Application').' The Minister's objection to competency 8 Counsel for the Minister referred as a starting point to s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) ('the FC Act'), which provides that the Federal Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from judgments of the Federal Magistrates Court. Thereafter my attention was drawn to s 24(1A) of the FC Act, which provides that an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment referred to in subsection (1) that is an interlocutory judgment, unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal. Section 25(2)(a) of the FC Act thereafter provides that applications for leave to appeal to the Court may be heard and determined by a single judge or a Full Court. 9 The Minister next emphasised that the Federal Magistrate's decision was indeed interlocutory, referring thereby to the distinction between final and interlocutory orders, enunciated for instance in Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 440 by Taylor J as follows: 'So an order made in the course of an action or suit which does not conclude the rights of the parties inter se, although it may, of course, conclude the fate of the particular application in which it is made, is interlocutory only. On this basis an order staying proceedings against one of several defendants on the grounds that they are scandalous, vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court has been treated as interlocutory: Hind v Marquis of Hartington (1890) 6 TLR 267. The same view was taken of an order striking out a plaintiff's statement of claim on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action: Jones v Insole (1891) 64 LT 703 and of an order dismissing an action as frivolous and vexatious In re Page [1910] 1 Ch 489.' That dictum was more recently applied by a Full Federal Court in Dai v Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman [2000] FCA 717 at [7] (per Beaumont, Whitlam and Lehane JJ). 10 The applicant provided no basis or reason why the course sought to be adopted should be open to him, given the history of the proceedings which speaks for itself. Plainly the plethora of decisions already made unfavourably to the applicant demonstrates that no substantial injustice would be occasioned by any refusal of the current purported further application to the Court. No matter of substance has been raised for my consideration. Nothing more is raised other than bare assertions of error. However no error is apparent on the face of the material before the Court. 11 The application must be dismissed with costs.

Case11190,cited,Blaikie v SA Superannuation Board (1996) 65 SASR 85,"As to the applicable principles I will refer to only two cases. The first is Easling v Mahoney Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd (2001) 78 SASR 489 a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia. There Olsson J (who was in dissent on other grounds) said (at 514): ""First it is necessary to address the concept of constructive dismissal. This was explored by me in some detail in Blaikie v SA Superannuation Board (1996) 65 SASR 85. I adhere to what I there said at pages 102-105. Suffice to reiterate that the notion of constructive dismissal implies the existence of conduct on the part of an employer which is plainly inimical to a continuance of a contract of employment according to its express or implied terms. The authorities establish the concept that there is implied in a contract of employment a term that the employer will not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between employer and employee. An intention to repudiate need not be proved. Rather, it is a matter of objectively looking at the employer's conduct as a whole and determining whether its effect, judged reasonably and sensibly, is such that the employee cannot be expected to put up with it."""
Case15037,referred to,SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195,"The Notice of Appeal alleging a breach of the requirements of s 424A of the Act was dismissed by Barnes FM in her reasons for judgment. Her Honour said in par 11: '... when one considers the Tribunal's reasons for decision, it is apparent that the reason for the Tribunal's findings, including its ultimate finding of a lack of satisfaction that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution (and hence was a person to whom Australia had protection obligations) was based on the inadequacy of the claims and the material submitted by the applicant. The Tribunal referred to the scant details of the applicant's claims and gave examples of such inadequacy.' Her Honour continued at par 12: 'This is not a case in which the Tribunal purported to rely on any inconsistencies between what appeared in the protection visa application and in the applicant's claims as made to the Tribunal. Rather the decision turned on the inadequacy of the materials provided. In such circumstances, as in SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [ 2005 ] FCA 1195 ['SZEZI'] , it cannot be said that there is information which forms the reason or part of the reason for affirming a decision under review subject to the operation of the obligation in section 424A(1). ' 5 Her Honour referred to the decision of Allsop J in SZEZI and accepted the application of his Honour's comments to the case before her Honour, where Allsop J had said, at par 29: '... The Tribunal, having read all the material and having evaluated its content and weight, was unable to reach a specified mental state. It was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear because of subjectively perceived inadequacies in the information. The reason for the decision was simply (and no more than) the evaluative conclusion founded upon the perceived inadequacy of the information, in the sense of an absence of detail and intrinsic explanation which had been invited. It would be an inadequate and misleading statement to say that the information was the reason or part of the reason for the decision. It was the lack of the requested further assistance and explanation that was the reason.'"
Case2938,applied,Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77,Hillig made no submissions on Mr Dates' entitlement to amend the application to change the identity of the claim group as a matter of procedure.

The New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council must approve the proposed disposal (s 40D(1)(b)) and certain Ministers must be notified (s 40D(1)(d)).

Case2825,cited,Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Belandra Pty Ltd (2003) 126 IR 165,"The reasons pleaded by the Employment Advocate as the prohibited reasons for carrying out the dismissal conduct and the refusal to employ in respect of each individual are these: Mr Stephen Blackadder &#8226; On 27 September 1999, Mr Blackadder gave evidence in a proceeding commenced by Mr Swain under the Act in which Mr Swain sought a reinstatement order against the First Respondent, among other orders (s 298L(1)(k)). &#8226; On 18 and 19 January and 17 February 2000, Mr Blackadder prosecuted a proceeding under the Act against the Third Respondent seeking a reinstatement order, among other orders (s 298L(1)(j)). &#8226; On 29 March 2000, Mr Blackadder obtained the benefit of a reinstatement order of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ('AIRC') (s 298L(1)(h)). Colin James Hambly &#8226; On 21 July 1999, Mr Hambly commenced proceedings under the Act against the Third Respondent seeking, among other things, a reinstatement order. &#8226; On 30 January 2000, Mr Hambly prosecuted that proceeding (s 298L(1)(j)). &#8226; On 14 February 2000, Mr Hambly obtained an order of the AIRC for reinstatement (s 298L(1)(h)).

Alick James Delaforce &#8226; On 17 February 2000, Mr Delaforce gave evidence and participated in a proceeding commenced by Mr Blackadder under the Act by which Mr Blackadder sought a reinstatement order against the Third Respondent (s 298L(1)(j)). &#8226; Mr Delaforce was both a member of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union ('AMIEU') and a delegate of the Union at the workplace (s 298L(1)(a)). &#8226; Mr Delaforce was dissatisfied with his conditions and was seeking improved conditions of employment for himself and other employees at the abattoir (s 298L(1)(l)). Paul Francis McKenzie &#8226; On 23 June 1999, Mr McKenzie proposed to give evidence and participate in a proceeding under the Act commenced by Mr Jason Robertson against the First Respondent seeking, among other things, a reinstatement order (s 298L(1)(j) and (k)). &#8226; Mr McKenzie was a member of the AMIEU (s 298L(1)(a)); and &#8226; Mr McKenzie was dissatisfied with his conditions of employment (s 298L(1)(l)). Trevor Glen Moss &#8226; Mr Moss was both a member of the AMIEU and a delegate of the Union at the abattoir (s 298L(1)(a)); and &#8226; Mr Moss was dissatisfied with his conditions and was seeking improved conditions both for himself and other employees at the abattoir (s 298L(1)(l)). Terence Anthony Brooks, Rodger Charles Campbell, Gregory Simon Forrest, Michael Robert McKenzie, John Kevin Young and Susan Jane Young &#8226; In respect of all of these individuals, the prohibited reasons are said to be that each of them was a member of the AMIEU and each was dissatisfied with his or her working conditions and in particular, wage levels paid by the relevant abattoir employer (s 298L(1)(a) and (l)). In respect of each allegation concerning dissatisfaction with working conditions, the allegation is made against the background of the Union seeking improved conditions for its members. 10 The Employment Advocate contends that although the conduct of dismissal occurred in September 2002, it was carried out for a prohibited reason deriving from a series of events of engagement between Mr Stuart Ramsey as the guiding mind of the employer entities and, in particular, Mr Justin Davis on behalf of the AMIEU, Mr Moss and Mr Delaforce as workplace delegates of the AMIEU and employee members of consultative committees formed to negotiate aspects of working conditions with Mr Ramsey, which occurred over a lengthy period. 11 The applicant contends that Mr Ramsey acquired, reopened and commenced operating the abattoir in April 1998 expressly on the footing that particular workplace arrangements could be negotiated and approved by the AIRC and that Mr Ramsey's view as to the content and formulation of those conditions would, from time to time as he thought appropriate, endure so as to secure the profitable operation of the abattoir. 364 Apart from these authorities, the notion of a refusal to employ a person has been the subject of discussion in Maritime Union of Australia v Burnie Port Corp. Pty Ltd (2000) 101 IR 435, per Ryan J; Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Belandra Pty Ltd (2003) 126 IR 165 per North J and Employment Advocate v Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd (2005) 139 IR 19. Although the decision of his Honour in Maritime Union of Australia v Burnie Port Corp. Pty Ltd was the subject of an appeal to the Full Court ( Burnie Port Corp. Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [2000] FCA 1768 ; (2000) 104 FCR 440), the approach adopted by Ryan J was not attended by error in any respect, on the issue of 'refusal to employ'. Her Honour, Branson J, in Employment Advocate v Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd found the reasons of Ryan J in the Full Court persuasive and they were these. There is no relevant distinction between refusing to employ an individual and an election by an employer to appoint other individuals to the position. A decision to employ someone else is necessarily a decision not to employ another. That reasoning was adopted by Branson J in finding that a respondent had refused to engage an independent contractor by deciding to award the contract to another party. 366 The respondents criticise the decision in AMIEU and Belandra on the basis that the evidentiary problem discussed by his Honour does not arise in the context of a lack of a vacancy because the applicant can readily show, by evidence, if there is a vacancy. The evidence would demonstrate that someone else was employed or there was an advertisement placed in a newspaper or other forum for a vacancy. Mr Hatcher puts it this way: 'It's not as if one needs to get inside the mind of the person making the decision to know what personally moved him, as it is when one alleges a prescribed reason' . The contention is that the applicant must adduce evidence of an actual, not theoretical, vacancy and demonstrate a refusal to employ that individual for that vacancy. Once that level of precision is made out, s 298V operates. In the absence of that evidence, s 298V has no role to play."
Case2442,cited,Pancontinental Mining Pty Ltd v Posgold Investments Pty Ltd (1994) 121 ALR 405,"The Commission accepts that parts of the pleading state conclusions and are of a general nature. It submits that such pleading may still define the issues and inform the respondents of the case they have to meet. In the present case, the Commission says that a level of generality is appropriate and that a conclusion may also be a pleading of a material fact ( Kernel Holdings per French J; State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete [2003] FCA 1454 ; (1999) ATPR 41-961 per Drummond J). It submits that this, like Pioneer , is a case in which it is unnecessary to strike out a conclusionary pleading. It is not, the Commission submits, a question whether the facts pleaded are sufficient in themselves to give rise to a cause of action but whether it would be open on the pleadings to prove the facts at the trial which would constitute a cause of action (Pancontinental Mining Pty Ltd v Posgold Investments Pty Ltd (1994) 121 ALR 405 per Beaumont J at 414). The Commission submits that it has pleaded the overt acts of the alleged conspirators and the conclusion. The Commission says that, taken together, this leads to the conclusion that there was an arrangement or understanding which contained a provision of the type impugned."

Case14946,considered,Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority [1979] HCA 21 ; (1979) 141 CLR 443,"The cases relied upon by his Honour included Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority [1979] HCA 21 ; (1979) 141 CLR 443 at 452-4 per Gibbs J (with whom Mason J agreed) and at 459 per Stephen J. His Honour continued: 'I do not overlook the credible distinction between the effect of the underlying contract as between the parties to it and its effect (if any) as between the holder of the security and the third person whose obligation constitutes the security. One can for brevity speak of a contractual qualification upon the owner's powers in relation to the security where the underlying agreement between the owner and the contractor or supplier contains a term which restricts the exercise of those powers in some way.' [29] 31 The Court declined to grant injunctions under the general law, they not having established a clear case of fraud by the head-contractor in making demand under the guarantees and that the bank was aware of any such fraud at the time of the post payment. There was accordingly no serious question to be tried in that respect. In so finding the Court applied Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority [1979] HCA 21 ; (1979) 141 CLR 443. 33 In Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority a condition in a contract for the construction of a pipeline required the contractor to provide a cash security or, alternatively, a bank guarantee as security for the contractors due and faithful performance of the work. This was in the nature of a performance guarantee. Another condition entitled the owner to retain 10% of the progress payments due to the contractor until the work had been performed and accepted in accordance with the contract. The owner, at the contractor's request, agreed to accept a bank guarantee in lieu of the monies retained. This was a so-called retention guarantee. By each of the guarantees the bank unconditionally undertook to pay the owner on demand any sum up to the limit specified in each guarantee. When the work was almost complete, the owner demanded payment from the bank under the guarantee. The contactor sought declarations and orders the purpose of which was to restrain the bank from making payment to the Authority under four instruments described on their face as bank guarantees given by the bank to the Pipeline Authority. The Court there held that the owner was entitled to demand and be paid the amount of the performance guarantee whether or not there had been a want of due and faithful performance of the work, and the monies so paid must be held by him as security for the contractors due and faithful performance of the work. 34 Gibbs J, having regard to the proper construction of the performance guarantee, said that to hold that the Banks should not pay on receiving a demand, but should be bound to inquire into the rights of the Authority and the contractor under a contract to which the bank was not a party would be to depart from the ordinary meaning of the undertaking that the Bank is to pay on demand. (p 451) However, Stephen J observed that, if the construction contract itself had contained some qualification upon the Authority's power to make a demand under a performance guarantee, the position in relation to the grant of such an injunction might well have been different (p 459). Young J in Hortico (Australia) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Co (Australia) Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 545 at 550-551 made observations to like effect. 47 The Banks contend that even if ONGC has incorrectly drawn down on the performance guarantees there are remedies available between Clough and ONGC, for example, by suing the beneficiary for an account and payment of any overpayment under a performance bond: Cargill International SA v Bangladesh Sugar &amp; Food Corporation [1996] 2 Lloyd's LR 524 at 530. See also Australasian Conference Association Ltd v Mainline Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq) [1978] HCA 45 ; (1978) 141 CLR 335 at 351 and Wood Hall Ltd v Pipeline Authority [1979] HCA 21 ; (1979) 141 CLR 443 at 454. It points also to the fact that there is no suggestion that ONGC would be unable to repay any amount owing. Accordingly damages from ONGC, it is said, would be an adequate remedy."

Case18592,distinguished,Western Aboriginal Legal Service Limited v Jones [2000] NSWADT 102 ,"support of its submission that a publication does not incite in matters of crime or violence unless the publication had an effect of the kind in (ii) of [23] above, the applicant referred to what was said by the New South Wales Administrative Decisions Tribunal ('the Tribunal') in a case under the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW): Western Aboriginal Legal Service Limited v Jones [2000] NSWADT 102. One of the issues that arose in the case was the meaning of 'incite' in s 20C of the Anti-Discrimination Act . The Tribunal accepted that the proper approach was to look at the Macquarie Dictionary definition of 'incite' and to give the word its ordinary and natural meaning. The Attorney submitted that in Western Aboriginal Legal Service Limited v Jones , the Tribunal considered the meaning of the word 'incite' in a different statutory context to that at issue in this case. Section 20C(1) of the Anti-Discrimination Act declares it 'unlawful for a person, by a public act, to incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of, a person or group of persons on the ground of the race of the person or members of the group'. The primary issue for the Tribunal was whether the word 'incite' incorporated an intent element. As the applicant acknowledges in [79] of its written submissions, having considered that the 'ordinary meaning' of 'incite' was unclear, the Tribunal had regard to extrinsic materials in order to properly define it in the particular context of s 20C(1) , including the Second Reading Speech and a report by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission on its review of the Act (at [86] [87], [89])."

As a result, the shape of goods (or of a part of goods) embodied by reason of the nature of the goods or a technical or functional result to be achieved by the goods could not distinguish the goods of one trade source from similar goods of another. [15]. The shape might distinguish or differentiate the goods as goods but not the trade source. Dealing in goods of that shape is thus use of the goods not use of the shape of those goods as a trade mark. Burchett J observed at [16]: The special cases where a shape of the goods may be a mark are cases falling within, not without, the principle he expounded [Windeyer J in Smith Kline]. For they are cases where the shape that is a mark is 'extra', added to the inherent form of the particular goods as something distinct which can denote origin. The goods can still be seen as having, in Windeyer J's words, 'an existence independently of the mark' which is imposed upon them."

Gleeson CJ observed that depending on the context, 'liability' can include contingent or potential liability (his Honour cited Walters v Babergh District Council (1983) 82 LGR (Eng) 235 (QBD)).

He gave that section a wide construction on its plain and natural meaning: Paras 152 FCR at 538 [16]. But Young J held that the applicant for the order had to satisfy the Court that, relevantly, the other party's conduct 'involved unreasonable acts or omissions that caused the [party applying for the order] to incur costs': Paras 152 FCR at 539 [19]. 28 At the hearing of the costs argument, counsel for the Birri-Gubba People argued that in preparing a matter for trial, the litigious landscape often changes. He pointed to the fact that it could be expected in ordinary litigation that some issues which were hotly contested at an interlocutory stage might fall away by the time of the trial as minds became focused on the real issues. And, he pointed out that since at least March 2007 all parties had been on notice that the description of the claim group would have to change in light of the latest anthropological research obtained by Birri-Gubba People as to the correct identity of the persons who could claim native title over the relevant lands and waters in the vicinity of Cape Upstart. Counsel for the Birri-Gubba People also argued that there were practical problems with the funding available to the land council. 29 The land council is presently the representative body under the Native Title Act . It was entitled to prioritise and make determinations as to the funding, staff, resources and complexity of this matter as one of a number for which it was responsible. Counsel argued that there was no basis on which the Court's discretion under s 85A of the Native Title Act was enlivened to warrant the making of a costs order against the Birri-Gubba People. He argued that the jurisdiction to award costs under s 85A should be only be exercised in circumstances where there were special or unusual features of the case, or where there had been conduct in the nature of an abuse of process, improper purpose, contempt or unreasonableness. In essence, that argument sought to confine the Court's power to award costs to circumstances which would warrant an order for costs on an indemnity basis in ordinary civil litigation (that is, in litigation where the Court's power to award costs does not have the constraint of s 85A(1) of the Act)."

Case15131,cited,House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499,"In my view, the second and third matters raised by the applicant may be seen as errors asserted by the applicant in the making of the further security for costs orders on 14 February 2007. Otherwise, they are simply an attempt to re-argue matters which have already been argued. I shall also therefore consider whether those matters might demonstrate some arguable prospect of success if an extension of time to appeal from those orders were granted.

The applicant is faced with further orders for security for costs. It cannot satisfy them. It acknowledges that. The proceedings have been permanently stayed. In those circumstances, nothing has been shown to indicate that the orders dismissing the proceedings against each of the respondents were inappropriate in the first place, or should now be discharged."

Case2540,applied,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Orica Ltd [1998] HCA 33 ; (1998) 194 CLR 500,"There is much force in BARM's contention that alternative (1) does not involve taxation by reference to economic equivalence. Generally speaking, that doctrine has been relied on to seek re-characterisation of a receipt or outgoing where there is more than one way to achieve the desired economic result and the taxpayer chooses the way which is the most tax effective. Anti-avoidance provisions aside, the courts have consistently rejected the doctrine of taxation by reference to economic equivalence, that is, by reference to the ways in which the transaction could or might have been done, as an aid to characterisation. As was said in the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Orica Ltd [1998] HCA 33 ; (1998) 194 CLR 500 at [70] : '[L]ittle or no guidance is offered by considering what other transactions the taxpayer might have made to achieve a commercial result substantially the same as the commercial result said to flow from the making of the Principal Assumption Agreement. No doubt the taxpayer might have taken the amount of $62,309.546 which it paid to MMBW and instead of paying it to MMBW under the Principal Assumption Agreement have invested it in Commonwealth Bonds maturing at or about the same time as its debentures were to mature. If it had done that it would have derived income which it might then have applied in satisfaction of most, if not all, of its liabilities to debenture holders. Similarly, it might have invested the same amount as it paid to MMBW on more speculative investments and it might then have obtained returns greater than the amount necessary to pay the debenture holders. Examination of those other transactions does not reveal whether or when the taxpayer derived income as a result of the making of the Principal Assumption Agreement. In particular, the characterisation of the gains or receipts obtained in accordance with hypothetical transactions of the kind described is of little, if any, assistance in characterising the nature of the benefits identified as flowing from the making of the Principal Assumption Agreement.' In many ways, this is no more than an echo of what was said over twenty years before by Sir Nigel Bowen in Federal Coke Co Pty Ltd v F C of T (1977) 34 FLR 375 at 386 387: 'His Honour appears to have considered that he could approach the characterisation of the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer by treating them as if they were received by Bellambi or the Bellambi group. On the other hand, if they were treated as received by Federal, his Honour thought that they were received by Federal just as much as compensation for the contraction of the contract to supply coke as if the payee had been the parent rather than the subsidiary. One may have some sympathy with an approach of this kind. However, in taxation matters, the court is obliged to have regard to the actual facts and not to their equivalents. In cases where it is appropriate the court may apply a statutory provision such as s 260 to get rid of a contract, agreement or arrangement and deal with the case in disregard of that element, but, where there is no statutory warrant for doing so, the court cannot disregard certain of the facts or re-arrange the facts or decide the case according to its view of the substance of the matter. It is not legitimate to disregard the separateness of different corporate entities or to decide liability to tax upon the basis of the substantial economic or business character of what was done.'"
Case6835,cited,Consolidated Fertilizers Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1992) 36 FCR 1,"There is no definition of 'interest' in the Deed.

Case4710,applied,Faulkner v Bluett (1981) 52 FLR 115,"Lockhart J, after considering a number of the early cases and the orthodox approach to a scope of the exemption based upon a wrong done to the bankrupt made this observation in Faulkner v Bluett (1981) 52 FLR 115 at 119: ""The common thread running through these cases is that where the primary and substantial right of action is direct pecuniary loss to the property or estate of the bankrupt, the right to sue passes to the trustee notwithstanding that it may have produced personal inconvenience to the bankrupt. Where the essential cause of action is the personal injury done to the person or feelings of the bankrupt, the right to sue remains with the bankrupt."" 47 Where the claim for final relief arising out of the conduct of a respondent reflects a claim with respect to both the rights of the bankrupt in property and a claim with respect to a wrong done to the bankrupt characterised as a claim by reference to the anxiety, stress and pain felt by the bankrupt, the rights of action in respect of the bankrupt's interests in property vest in the trustee and those rights of action where the essential cause is emotional injury done to the bankrupt (in respect of a recognised cause of action) remain with the bankrupt. 48 It may be that when Mr Rogers or his advisers formulate a statement of claim in the proceeding, a claim might emerge which, in terms of its material facts, reflects a claim within the exemption reliant upon conduct which involves a contravention of ss52 , 51AC or 60 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) independently of any of the former rights of the bankrupt in property which have become vested in the trustee. At the moment, the material does not establish any such right. The alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which are mere conclusionary assertions are relied upon as the basis for final orders with respect to the interests of the bankrupt in property which interests have become vested in the trustee."

Case9750,followed,De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290,"A number of other propositions were endorsed in Ward (HC). They were recently summarised in De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (' De Rose (FC) (No 2) '), at [145], as follows: (the references are to paragraphs in Ward (HC) ). '(i) Native title rights and interests are properly to be seen as a bundle of rights, the separate components of which can be extinguished separately (at [76]-[77]). (ii) Where a grant of rights in land is made pursuant to statute, the question (so far as extinguishment is concerned) is whether the rights are inconsistent with native title rights and interests in respect of the land [(at [214])]. This is an objective inquiry which requires identification of and a comparison between two sets of rights, one deriving from traditional laws and customs and the other from 'the new sovereign authority that came with settlement' (at [78], [82]). Reference to the use of land is relevant only to the extent that it focuses attention upon the rights pursuant to which the land is used (at [78]). (iii) Rights held under an interest in land less than a fee simple estate, such as a lease, can be inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests and therefore can extinguish them (at [80]). (iv) There is no such thing as degrees of inconsistency of rights: ""Two rights are inconsistent or they are not. If they are inconsistent, there will be extinguishment to the extent of the inconsistency ... Absent particular statutory provision to the contrary, questions of suspension of one set of rights in favour of another do not arise "" ( at [82]). (Emphasis added.) (v) Section 23G(1)(b)(i) of the NTA contemplates that a previous non-exclusive possession act, such as a pre- RD Act pastoral lease, may grant rights and interests that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests and extinguish the latter (at [192]; see, too, Wilson v Anderson, at [46]). Where that occurs, no question of suspension of native title arises. (vi) Section 23G(1)(b)(ii) of the NTA addresses the case where there is an inconsistent grant of rights which, apart from the NTA and its State [or Territory] counterpart, would not extinguish native title rights and interests. The example given is a post-1975 grant which, by operation of the RD Act , was ineffective to extinguish native title rights and interests (at [82]). (This seems to involve reading the expression ""the grant of rights"" in s 23G(1)(b) as including a purported grant, given that the RD Act would, apart from the NTA , presumably render the grant invalid.)' To these six propositions derived from Ward (HC) two others can usefully be added: (vii) Reference to the use of land in the context of extinguishment may distract attention from the true inquiry, namely whether rights have been created in third parties that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests. Use of land may suggest, or even demonstrate, that such rights have been created, but the basic inquiry is about inconsistency of rights, not use (at [215]). (viii) The metaphor of a 'bundle of rights' is useful in two respects: 'It draws attention first to the fact that there may be more than one right or interest and secondly to the fact that there may be several kinds of rights and interests in relation to land that exist under traditional law and custom' (at [95]). (Emphasis added.)"

Case5018,cited,Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 (3) SAf LR 261 ,"noted above, Comandate Marine's proceedings in rem contained no such request. And, Art 8(1) of the Model Law, relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration, if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute. 59 Russell on Arbitration (22 nd ed) at 610 [A5-018] refers to Art 8(1) having the same effect as English law; i.e. the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings (op cit at 296 [7-005]). The position is similar under s 53(2) of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW) which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court. I am of opinion that Comandate Marine's conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement, and that Art 8(1) and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it. Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood [1910] 1 Ch at 786-787. By pleading the writ in the way which it did, Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 4(3)(f) of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) in this Court. I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court, Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage. It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ. The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed (notionally or actually) to the mast of the Boomerang I . Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded, it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). In its report: Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction (Report No 33, 1986) Law Reform Commission (Australia), the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere, if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction. The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied, and hence that a just result would be obtained. It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made, and in achieving co-operation between courts and arbitrators to this end. However, the Commission desired, in the solution it proposed, that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits (ALRC 33 [189]). That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that, as at 1986, English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security, although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum: The Tuyuti [1984] QB 838 at 851; Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 (3) SAf LR 261 at 268, 270 (Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa). Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854 at 915-916. There, Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract, which was still executory, involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations, including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches, arising under the executory, and now abandoned, contract. Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, who gave the leading speech (see [1983] 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock) said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact ([1983] 1 AC at 913F). He continued ([1983] 1 AC at 914A-C): 'The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law : see Chitty on Contracts , 23 rd ed. (1968), vol 1, p 577, para 1231, and cases there cited. Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way, there are two ways in which A can put his case. The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party, as evinced to the other party and acted on by him, leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract. The second method is by showing that the conduct of B, as evinced towards A, has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract, even though it has not in fact been B's intention to do so, and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief. The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B. The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting, as against A, that he, B, has not abandoned the contract : Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd [1919] 1 KB 78.' This contractual analysis is inapposite here, but their Lordships' approach shows that, notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit, the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties' obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed. In international trade and commerce, it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with, in particular, the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth). This is because in international trade and commerce, the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested, an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute. The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute. It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45(b) invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century. Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration, including Australia, are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce. However, the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45(b) rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties' chosen method or place of dispute resolution. Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and, indeed, local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains: see e.g.: Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M/V Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 (1995); Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler-Plymouth Inc 473 US 614, 638 (1985); Scherk v Alberto-Culver Co 417 US 506, 516 (1974); Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 343 per Brennan and Dawson JJ, 354 per Toohey J agreeing (cf: Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F.C.R.S. Shipping Ltd (1994) 113 DLR (4 th ) 536 at 541-542 (Federal Court of Appeal). But, just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45(b), so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election. When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized, it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings. It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way, but it did not do so. The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied, and to which Sheppard J referred, did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election. For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable. Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too, the arbitration agreement in cl 45(b) has been, in substance, abandoned or for the purposes of s 7(5) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed. WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING? Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. Pan says that where the contract was formed, as it argues the charter party was in this case, either by acts or conduct, Art II r 2 is not satisfied. Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence. In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS (1995) Year Book Comm. Arb'n XX 739 at 740. The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded, there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram. Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer ((1997) Year Book Comm. Arb'n Vol II, 237 at 238). The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required. A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party's appearance in the arbitration. In this matter, however, the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation, but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far. The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur. I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal, as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. And, In Zambia Steel &amp; Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark &amp; Eaton Ltd [1986] 2 Lloyd's Rep 225 at 234, Ralph Gibson LJ said: 'It is clear to me that the [New York] Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document.' The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg [2003] 2 WWR 621 at 628 [18] that Art IV r 1(b) of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award, to provide '[t]he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof'. They said that '... there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process', in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an 'agreement in writing'. In A.J. van den Berg's The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 (1981) at 196-198, 206, 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded (at 197, 227) that, as at 1981 there had been only one '... exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2', that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam. The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters, and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised. Significantly, he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate. In his article 'Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice ? ' (1996) International Arbitration vol 12, no 1, p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg's interpretation. Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders, the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention, who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate's consideration of Prof Sanders' proposal to add to the draft of Art II r 2 the following words: 'Confirmation in writing by one of the parties (which is kept) without contestation by the party.' (UN DOC E/CONF. 26L.54) The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected (van den Berg: op cit at 196; Kaplan: op cit 32-33). Earlier, as Kaplan J, he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited [1994] 2 HKC 526 (HCMP000 908/1994) that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law (see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth)). Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant, in writing, assented to the agreement to arbitrate (see at [12]). It has been recognized that a national courts, in the interest of uniformity, should construe rules formulated by an international convention, especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods, in a normal manner, appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention, unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law, or by English or domestic legal precedent, but on broad principles of general acceptation: Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd [1980] HCA 51 ; (1980) 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce's speech in James Buchanan &amp; Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping (UK) Ltd [1978] AC 141 at 152 and see too: Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M/V Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 537 (1995) per Kennedy J (Renquist CJ, Scalia, Souter, Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing). Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say (147 CLR at 159): 'It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application.' (see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad [1998] HCA 65 ; (1988) 196 CLR 161 at 186 [71] per McHugh J) It is also important in construing international conventions, that the views taken by courts, particularly the Supreme Courts of nations, are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation. And, I am conscious that in s 3(1) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) the definition of 'arbitration agreement' is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2. As a matter of construction under Australian law, I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one. However, I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. The pre-contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free-standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed. It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter. And as Capt Piperakis said, he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided. The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel, on the evidence before me, unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound. That agreement, which thus brought cl 45(b) into existence as an agreement to arbitrate, was manifested by Comandate Marine's conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel. At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party, including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication, even though both parties have not executed it: The Epsilon Rosa [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep 509 at 514 [21] per Tuckey LJ (May and Brooke LJJ agreeing). But as Tuckey LJ pointed out ([2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 515 [29]) one cannot generalize in these cases. The act of acceptance, which formed the contract, was the provision of the bank guarantee. And, it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine. Both parties were under a duty to co-operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing ( Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68 at 70-71 per Griffith CJ). No doubt cl 45(b) was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine. But that does not, of itself, comply with Art II r 2. Rather, the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence. So, the contract (being or including the arbitration agreement) was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails. The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2. And, because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of 'letters or telegrams' including telexes or emails, then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2. A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer: Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited (1988) 14 NSWLR 523 at 534-535 per McHugh JA (Samuels JA agreeing at 531). Accordingly, I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed 'FINAL RECAP' was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee. For the reasons I have given, based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient, on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no 'agreement in writing' for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention. COMANDATE MARINE'S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 (NSW) Comandate Marine argued, that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 7(2) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) were not found, I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW). The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW) provides that an arbitration agreement '... means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration' (see s 4(1)). By s 53(1) the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration. Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem, as I have found, without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings, I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration. However, its application for stay is made in Pan's proceedings. At the time when Pan's proceedings were commenced, Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now. I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant. By s 53(2) , the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance. Although Comandate Marine's proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings, they form, as I have held, part of the same 'matter' for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution , and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found. SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A , 52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87 , including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were 'colourable'. It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court. Rather, it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) were, in essence, the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan. Comandate Marine, in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction. I do not think this argument has any substance. Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), in which s 52 is found, sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce. The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree [2005] HCA 69 ; (2005) 80 ALJR 183 at 191 [29] per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 83 [97] . In the latter case, the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 205 (see 202 CLR at 83 [97]), in the following terms: 'Likewise, the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing-off. If, as I consider, the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law, it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law. The statute provides an additional remedy .' (emphasis added) I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction. The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) under the trade and commerce power in s 51(i) of the Constitution . There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court's jurisdiction. Pan's pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct. I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell (cf: D'Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 755 at 761 [32] ). The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13. But, on examination, s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court, including this Court, has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) itself. Rather, s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76(ii) or (iii) of the Constitution . In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise, s 13 thus provides some guidance. It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76(ii) and (iii) of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court. Section 76(iii) ('of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction') is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12 . And s 76(ii) provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter 'arising under any laws made by the Parliament'. The purpose of s 13 is to limit, in the construction of the Act, the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth. It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction. Clearly enough, s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words: Owners of ""Shin Kobe Maru"" v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421; see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia [2006] HCA 38 at [7] - [10] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Crennan JJ. Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked, the Court should exercise it ( Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511 at 588 [149] ), even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse: cf: Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority [2006] HCA 27 [3]-[15] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ: see too: Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship 'Global Peace' [2006] FCA 954 at [138] per Allsop J, see too at [62]-[76]. Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) by s 31. But s 31(1) provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person (defined by s 3(1) as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person) who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property. The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it. Next, Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act. Here, part of the 'matter', within the meaning of ss 76(ii) and (iii) of the Constitution , is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which Pan has pleaded. The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such 'matters'. Here, the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently, one of the other, confers jurisdiction on this Court. Accordingly, I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this. That is not to say, however, that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available, necessarily, to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person, such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12 . I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction. Rather, appositely to the present proceedings, there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act. Pan's claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim: s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The Court, at the final hearing, can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters, including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims. Indeed, one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract, not pursuant to contractual principles, but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act: Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 at 409 [52] . And, the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) are designed to give effect, in cases of contravention of s 52 , to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 83 [97] ; Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree [2005] HCA 69 ; (2005) 80 ALJR 183. International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels, is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution (s 51(i)). And, par 15 of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia (see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 at 568 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 539 at 547A-548D per Beaumont, Drummond and Sundberg JJ). Next, Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The 'Kiukiang Career' ( Hi-Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc (No 5) (1998) 90 FCR 1). In that case the relevant clause provided that 'any dispute arising from this charter' would be settled in a London arbitration. Obviously, it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made. Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment (with whom Branson J expressly agreed) considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause (cl 45(b)): viz: 'arising out of'. Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement (90 FCR at 21G). But, he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question (90 FCR at 22A-B) and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party (90 FCR at 22B-C). In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd (1996) 39 NSWLR 160 Gleeson CJ (Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing) held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement, notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked, so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause. Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement, the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre-contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) does not bring a statutory claim within the expression 'arising out of this contract'. Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40 -636 on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement. In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales, the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement, as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention (39 NSWLR at 166F-G). As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 344 (with whom Toohey J agreed at p 354) in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes 'arising out of' or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof (169 CLR at 337) '... the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between [the parties] or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause: Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40-636 at 47,173'. In Union of India v EB Abby's Rederi AS ('The Evje') [1975] AC 797 Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, reasoned that a dispute was one 'arising out of' a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York/Antwerp Rules 1950 and to be settled in London. He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation ([1975] AC 807H-808B, 808G, Lord Reid at 804E, and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at 816C). Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect ([1975] AC at 816F-8). In Ethiopian Oil Seed &amp; Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc [1990] 1 Lloyd's Rep 86 at 97, Hirst J took the view that the words 'arising out of' covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all. He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties' presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings. And, in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation [2004] FCA 698 ; (2004) 138 FCR 496 at 503-504 [32] - [37] Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses, where the fair reading of them is not confined, was to give width, flexibility and amplitude to them (see [2004] FCA 698 ; 138 FCR 496 at 504 [36] ). Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons (Rochdale) Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 439. There, French J said of a clause providing for disputes 'arising under this agreement' that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement: '... can be said to arise out of the agreement. They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance. No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement.' (43 FCR at 448) In my opinion French J's reasoning, although directed to a different form of words, is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claims. In the The 'Playa Laga' [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 171 at 183, Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words 'all disputes arising out of this contract' are less precise than they looked. They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd [1916] 1 AC 314 at 328. The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution, first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause. Their Lordships, obiter, observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts, that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other, the dispute falls within the arbitration clause ([1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 183). And, in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40 -636 at 47,173-47,174 Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract. He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source. And, conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established, if at all, irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties. Beaumont J said: 'In short, an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is not, as a matter of characterization, a ""controversy or claim arising out of or relating to (the) Agreement"" for the purposes of ... that contract.' I agree with Beaumont J's analysis. However, in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd [2005] FCA 1102 at [56] Allsop J suggested that the phrase 'arising out of' in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical, rather than theoretical, meaning to be given to the word 'contract' out of which disputes may arise. He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation, extent and scope. Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The 'Kuikang Career' (1998) 90 FCR 1 (see [2005] FCA 1102 [68]). I am of opinion that the Full Court's construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event, like Allsop J, I am bound by it. Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd [2005] HCA 67 ; (2005) 222 ALR 202 indicated that The 'Kiukiang Career' 90 FCR 1 was no longer good law and it should not be followed. I do not accept that argument. The construction of the operation of ss 82 and 86 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd [2005] HCA 67 ; (2005) 222 ALR 202 was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression 'arising by reason of a contract'. Thus Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were, for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), claims 'arising by reason of a contract' (222 ALR at 219 [71]). The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose 'by reason of the contract', because if the thing complained of, namely the entry into the contract, had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s 82(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). Here, the claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) however, did not 'arise out of the contract', because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim. Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence, although elements of the performance of the contract, or non performance of the contract will have become relevant. Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti-anti-suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) amounted 'to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract'. The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament, is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law. If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention. ESTOPPEL Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention. I do not understand how that could be. The facts are objective. The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later (cf Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353 at 360). No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind. There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter. I see no substance in the argument. ANTI-ANTI-SUIT INJUNCTION Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate. I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court's jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country. I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment ( Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' [2006] FCA 881). However, Comandate Marine, by its counsel, offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s 7(2) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claims, to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and/or entry into of the charter and/or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl 45(b) and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration. Comandate Marine, by its counsel, also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction, and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties. Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Comandate's undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators. There is no power in s 7(2) to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate. The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause ( Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 344). While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum, they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party. Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings, if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London, it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on 22 June 2006 the injunction must be continued. BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia. The Master and crew, when not at sea, might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere. The vessel's classification society representatives were in Greece, Singapore and Sri Lanka. The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December 2005 and there were also the ship's agent and surveyor located there. The owners' and charterers' Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June 2006. Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London. It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors. It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in 2005, the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year. There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis' evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute. I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct, although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on 22 June 2006. While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel's condition, it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned. Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing. The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship's company. Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least 12 different witnesses, 10 from the Authority, who may be required to give evidence. Of course, certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore, on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship's company will be from Australia. There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl 45(b) that the seat of the arbitration be there. CONCLUSION I order that Comandate Marine's motion be dismissed with costs. It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on 13 July 2006 until further order will continue undisturbed.

Case21391,referred to,Wellington Newspapers Ltd v Dealers Guide Ltd [1984] 2 NZLR 66,Court must consider all of the circumstances surrounding the infringement in its consideration of whether the infringement was flagrant or resulted from mistake or carelessness: see Wellington Newspapers Ltd v Dealers Guide Ltd [1984] 2 NZLR 66 per McMullin J at 69. Those circumstances include the state of mind of Technicon relating to the design infringement which has been referred to in the Court's finding on fraudulent imitation. Technicon submits that additional damages should not be awarded because there was no purpose or advantage in Technicon publishing a drawing which did not reflect its product.
Case20137,referred to,Georgiadis v Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation [1994] HCA 6 ; (1994) 179 CLR 297,"The above decision has been applied subsequently: see Olbers . See also Georgiadis v Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation [1994] HCA 6 ; (1994) 179 CLR 297 at 306-307 where the majority said: Not every Commonwealth law with respect to the acquisition of property falls within s. 51(xxxi) of the Constitution . It may be outside that paragraph because, although it effects an acquisition of property, it is a law of a kind that is clearly within some other head of legislative power. That is the case with a law imposing taxation or a law providing for the sequestration of the estate of a bankrupt. Or it may be outside s. 51(xxxi) because it effects an acquisition of a kind that does not permit of just terms, as in the case of a law imposing a penalty by way of forfeiture. And, it may fall outside s. 51(xxxi) because it cannot fairly be characterized as a law for the acquisition of property for a purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. That will generally be the case with laws directed to resolving competing claims or providing for ""the creation, modification, extinguishment or transfer of rights and liabilities as an incident of, or a means for enforcing, some general regulation of the conduct, rights and obligations of citizens in relationships or areas which need to be regulated in the common interest""."

Case5149,cited,Hookway v Racing Victoria Limited [2005] VSCA 310,"In my view, Mrs McGuiness was not labouring under a mistake when she authorised the payment to Keddies. She acknowledged that there may be an appeal and that she may be unsuccessful and may be required to repay the moneys (cf Hookway v Racing Victoria Limited [2005] VSCA 310 at [45] ). Her payment was a voluntary payment. The consequence of that payment was that the costs agreement was brought to an end. The condition precedent under the contract did exist at that time. 38 Mason K and Carter JW ( Restitution Law in Australia (Butterworths, 1995) at [415]) discuss the situation where a person pays to another moneys apparently due under a contract where the person: '(1) has a conscious but mistaken understanding of the payer's legal obligation to pay or the payee's legal right to receive the money; (2) intends to settle a claim honestly made by the payee; or (3) knows the money is not due or has no belief one way or the other on the matter, but is willing to pay because of the relationship with the payee or some anticipated benefit.'"
Case24330,referred to,The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Rohm and Haas Company [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601,"Explanatory Memorandum does not really assist. Section 101(4) makes it clear that it has been inserted without any attempt to limit or qualify the discretion provided for in s 101(3). The Explanatory Memorandum itself speaks of ""clarification"". This can either recognise that s 101(4) expands the discretion or that it simply makes it clear which factors could already be taken into account under s 101(3). In my view, use of a trade mark on closely related goods or services could already be taken into account in exercising the discretion under s 101(3) in the unamended section. As I read s 101(3) , the discretion to be exercised is not limited. For the purposes of s 101(3) , account may be taken of use of the trade mark on closely related goods or services, even in cases commencing prior to the introduction of s 101(4). This has particular relevance in the case of goods that are at the forefront of technological change. Justice Dixon (as he then was) said in The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Rohm and Haas Company [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 at 627 that the basis of a claim to proprietorship in a trade mark so far unused is found in the combined effect of authorship of the mark, the intention to use it on or in connection with the goods and the application for registration. In Magnavox , the Assistant Registrar considered a mark which had not been used across the scope of the goods claimed. In coming to a conclusion as to use across a class of goods, I agree with the Assistant Registrar (at 2078) that ' the rights arising from the registration of a trade mark should not be confined to the stage of technological development of goods specified when the mark was registered '. The relevant date for the exercise of the discretion"
Case14829,cited,Re Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2003] FCA 598 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 77,"overlapping considerations affecting the exercise of the discretion whether to extend the convening period may be summarised as follows: (a) the Court should recognise the objective of speed of administration that was associated with the introduction of Part 5.3A by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 (Cth) as from 23 June 1993. The Court should also recognise the objectives stated in para 507 of the explanatory memorandum associated with the Bill for that Act, that it was expected that the power to extend the period would be exercised infrequently since it is an important objective of Part 5.3A that creditors be fully informed about the company's position as early as possible and have an opportunity to vote on its future as soon as possible: Mann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 611 (Young J) at 612; Re Geraldton Building Co Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed); ex parte Trevor [2000] WASC 320 (Owen J) at [5]; (b) the function of the Court is to strike an appropriate balance between the legislature's expectation that the administration will be a relatively swift and summary procedure, and the requirement that undue speed should not be allowed to prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed towards maximising the return for creditors and any return for shareholders: Re Diamond Press Australia Pty Limited [2001] NSWSC 313 (Barrett J) at [10]; Re Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2003] FCA 598 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 77 (Lindgren J) ( Pan Pharmaceuticals ) at [42]; Re New Horizons Corporation; ex parte De Vries [2004] NSWSC 253 (Austin J) at [5]; (c) the prospects of a better outcome for creditors through a longer period of administration may outweigh the general expectation of a prompt resolution of the administration : Re Fincorp Group Holdings Pty Ltd (2007) 62 ACSR 192 (Barrett J) ( Fincorp ) at [18]; (d) a particular consideration against the too ready grant of an extension is the fact that while the voluntary administration continues there is an embargo or moratorium on the enforcement of remedies by secured creditors, lessors and others: Fincorp 62 ACSR 192 at [4]; Chamberlain, in the matter of South Wagga Sports and Bowling Club Ltd (Administrator Appointed) [2009] FCA 25 (Jacobson J) at [9]; (e) the application is to be assessed by reference to whether an extension is necessary to enable the administrators to prepare and provide the report and statements, and, in particular, to arrive at the opinion referred to in s 439A(4), in order to inform creditors adequately so that they will be in a position to decide whether to terminate the administration, execute a deed of company arrangement or place the company in liquidation : Pan Pharmaceuticals [2003] FCA 598 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 77 at [41] ; ABC Learning Centres Limited, in the matter of ABC Learning Centres Limited; application by Walker (No.7) [2009] FCA 454 (Emmett J) ( ABC Learning Centres) at [28]; (f) it is often desirable that any extension be accompanied by an order under s 447A, permitting the meeting to be held at any time during the convening period as extended: see the order made in Re Daisytek Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 575 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 446 ( Daisytek ) at [10] [18]."

Although the trustee was successful in its notice of motion to strike out paragraphs of the Defence and in its opposition to para 24 of the Cross-Claim, the principal proceedings will now continue in the Family Court.

Case12091,cited,Quanta Software International Pty Ltd v Computer Management Services Pty Ltd (2000) 175 ALR 536,"The issue which the Court must address on preliminary discovery is whether circumstances exist which support a conclusion that the applicant has a 'reasonable cause to believe': see Malouf v Malouf [1999] FCA 710 at [16] ; Quanta Software International Pty Ltd v Computer Management Services Pty Ltd (2000) 175 ALR 536 at 541-542. It is not for the Court at the stage of preliminary discovery to determine finally the detail or weight of the evidence on which the applicant's belief is founded. That is a matter for the final hearing, when evidence is fully adduced and tested in cross-examination, after all interlocutory procedures have been undertaken and full discovery given."
Case23325,cited,Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720,"critical words of s 31A(1), when applied to the present case, require me to be satisfied that the respondents have ""... no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding ..."". The following principles may be extracted from the authorities: (a) The moving party does not have to demonstrate that the defence is hopeless or unarguable; (b) The Court must consider the pleadings and the evidence with a ""critical eye"" in order to see whether the respondent party has evidence of sufficient quality and weight to be able to succeed at trial ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 at [23] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J)); (c) The respondent party is not obliged to present its whole case in order to defeat the summary judgment applicant but must at least present a sufficient outline of the evidence in order to enable the Court to come to a preliminary view about the merits for the purpose of considering the statutory test in s 31A(1)(b) ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 at [22] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J)); and (d) The test may require greater scrutiny of the pleadings and evidence in some cases than in others. In my judgment, the words of s 31A(1) compel a flexible approach. The real question in every case is not so much whether there is any issue that could arguably go to trial but rather whether there is any issue that should be permitted to go to trial. This seems to be the approach of Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 and of Gordon J in the same case (as to which see [123] [134] (pp 406 409)), although Rares J in that case at [73] [74] (p 394) and in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 esp at [45] (p 731) favoured a test which is much closer to the older test articulated in authorities decided under Rules of Court expressed in terms different from the language of s 31A(1)). I agree with the helpful summary of the relevant principles given by Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 where, at [5] and [6] of his Honour's Reasons, his Honour said: Section 31A of the Act Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen ""the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases"": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings; (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial; (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial; (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

Case21898,referred to,Daniel v State of Western Australia (2000) 178 ALR 542,"The relevant provisions of the Evidence Act have been analysed in cases such as Daniel v State of Western Australia (2000) 178 ALR 542, Neowarra and in Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia (No 2) (2003) FCA 893 ( Harrington-Smith ). I respectfully adopt those analyses. It is therefore necessary to refer only briefly to its provisions. 457 His Honour observed at [24] - [25] that 'the Evidence Act does not, in terms, require, as a condition of admissibility, that an expert witness state distinctly and fully the facts assumed as the basis of his or her opinion: cf ALRC Report No 26 ('Evidence') vol 1, par 750; Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 371 at 373-374 per Branson J; Daniel v State of Western Australia (2000) 178 ALR 542 (RD Nicholson J) at [5]; Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 per Branson J at [10]. But expert opinion will not be relevant if there is an insufficient correspondence between all the facts assumed by the expert as the basis for his or her opinion, and those proved or admitted: cf Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 648-649. Absent that sufficient correspondence, it cannot be known whether the opinion proffered applies to the facts proved or admitted. If I cannot discern in a report, distinguishing between them, the expert's opinion and all facts assumed by the expert on which that opinion is based, I will not be able to be satisfied: &#8226; that the assumed facts are, to a sufficient degree, the actual facts as I find them to be, to make that opinion ""relevant"" for the purposes of s 56 of the Evidence Act (cf Quick at 374 per Branson J; Sydneywide at [14] per Branson J); or &#8226; (perhaps) that the opinion proffered is one substantially based on the expert's specialised knowledge, for the purposes of s 79 of the Evidence Act (cf Makita at [85] per Heydon JA) While perhaps it cannot be said that in all cases evidence of expert opinion will be inadmissible if an expert does not separately list all the factual assumptions underlying his or her report, if this is not done, there is a substantial risk that the court will not be able to be satisfied on reading the report, as to what they were, with the result that the opinion will be inadmissible. If the expert does not state and distinguish between all the factual assumptions underlying the opinion and the opinion itself, can I be satisfied that the two criteria of admissibility mentioned are met? ' 463 Nicholson J discussed the specialised knowledge of anthropologists in Daniel v State of Western Australia (2000) 178 ALR 542 at [24]: 'The specialised knowledge of an anthropologist derives from the function to be performed by the anthropologist and for which he or she is trained and in relation to which study has been undertaken and experience gained. ""Anthropology"" is the science of humankind, in the widest sense: The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, p 87. Cultural or social anthropology is the science of human social and cultural behaviour and its development. Socio-cultural anthropology is traditionally divided into ethnography and ethnology. The former is the primary, data-gathering part of socio-cultural anthropology, that is, field work in a given society. This involves the study of everyday behaviour, normal social life, economic activities, relationships with relatives and in-laws, relationship to any wider nation-state, rituals and ceremonial behaviour and notions of appropriate social behaviour. See C P Kottak, Anthropology: the Exploration of Human Diversity, 3 rd ed, 1982, p 12. It is apparent that an anthropologist carrying out field work is more than likely to speak to a wide range of persons in the people under examination.'"
Case17591,followed,Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 3) [2003] 2 AC 1,"do not propose to add greatly to the discussion of the meaning and effect of s 31A. In the United Kingdom it has been held in the context of the similar rule 24.2 of the CPRs noted at [53] above, that the expressions ""no real prospect of succeeding"" and ""no real prospect of successfully defending"" require attention to be given to real, as opposed to ""fanciful"" or ""merely arguable"" prospects: Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91 at 92; Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 3) [2003] 2 AC 1 at [90], [95], [133] [134], [158] [162]; ED &amp; F Man Products Ltd v Patel [2003] EWCA Civ 472 at [8] . The Queensland Court of Appeal has similarly held, following Swain v Hillman and Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England , that the ""no reasonable prospects of success"" test requires the court to determine whether there are ""real"" as opposed to ""fanciful"" prospects of success: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo [2005] QCA 227 ; [2005] 2 Qd R 232 at 235. The New South Wales Court of Appeal had to consider the expression ""reasonable prospects of success"" as it occurred in s 198J of the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW) in Lemoto v Able Technical Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 153 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 300. That section prohibited a solicitor or barrister from providing legal services on a claim or defence of a claim for damages unless the solicitor or barrister reasonably believed on the basis of provable facts and a reasonably arguable view of the law that the claim or the defence had reasonable prospects of success. Later subsections elaborated on the meaning of the prohibition. This fact, coupled with the fact that the prohibition was directed to the reasonable belief of the solicitor or barrister, renders the discussion not directly relevant to the summary dismissal context in which the court is required to determine if there are reasonable prospects of success following an inter partes hearing."
Case18860,cited,Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International services Inc (2003) ATPR 41-949,"I am satisfied that the claims made by the applicant as formulated by the proposed amended application cannot succeed and are bound to fail in the sense identified by Bennett J in Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Services Inc (2003) ATPR 41-949 at 47, 410. Accordingly, it would be futile to grant leave to amend in terms of the proposed document. I refuse leave to amend and dismiss the applicant's notice of motion filed on 12 September 2007. 62 I have given consideration to this difficulty. I am not sure whether the failure to formulate a ground of challenge supported by material facts is a function of delay by Mr Royds or for that matter Mr Royds and Dr Mitchelson. I am satisfied that Mr Royds does not appreciate the need to comply with a time limitation contained in the principal legislation nor the need to file and serve a properly formulated document identifying arguable grounds supported by material facts rather than simply filing anything. Nor, apparently, is there an appreciation of a need to comply with orders of the court."

Nor, in my opinion, can the applicant do what the applicant sought to do by seeking to set aside the bankruptcy and have an order for an annulment bring proceedings at the same time against those other parties, if it be the case, for the malicious procurement of the bankruptcy or conspiracy to cause the bankruptcy: Re Coyle and Another (1993) 120 ALR 527. In my opinion, these proceedings are misconceived. The applicant is not entitled in this proceeding to seek damages against the third to ninth respondents whilst at the same time seeking to set aside the order for bankruptcy and seeking an order for an annulment. Whilst he remains a bankrupt he has no right of action of the kind that he seeks to pursue against the third to ninth respondents."

Case16416,cited,Green v Housing Authority of Clackamas County 994 F Supp 1253 (D Or 1998),"Some support for an interpretation which recognises the breadth of the statute can be found in two US cases where similarly drafted legislation was considered: &#8226; In Bronk v Ineichen 54 F 3d 425 (7th Cir 1995) two profoundly deaf tenants complained that they had been the subject of discrimination by their landlord in relation to their dog which they claimed as a hearing dog. In acknowledging that it was necessary to establish as a minimum that the disabled persons' quality of life would be enhanced because the effect of their disability would be ameliorated by the accommodation of the animal (at 429), the United States Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit held that lack of formal schooling did not mean that the dog did not have enough skills to actually aid in the daily functions of a deaf person (at 430, 431). The relevant legislation in that case was Wis Stat Ann SS101.22 (4)(bm) which related, inter alia , to ""an animal that is specially trained to lead or assist the individual with impaired vision, hearing or mobility..."". &#8226; In Green v Housing Authority of Clackamas County 994 F Supp 1253 (D Or 1998) where the landlord argued that the dog was not an appropriate accommodation for a deaf person because the plaintiffs were unable to produce any ""verification"" that the dog was a ""certified"" hearing assistance trained animal, the United States District Court found in favour of the plaintiff on grounds including that there was no relevant certification process for hearing dogs and no requirement as to the amount or type of training a service animal must undergo (at 1255-1256). The relevant legislation in that case was Or Rev Stat SS346,690 which prohibited a landlord from refusing to rent a dwelling unit to a physically impaired person on the basis of the use or possession of an assistance animal."

Case8264,referred to,Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601,"The application was remitted to this Court pursuant to orders made by Gaudron J following the delivery of judgment in Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601. 4 By letter dated 12 November 2004, the District Registrar of this Court notified the applicant that the Court proposed to consider whether there was an arguable case on the basis of the written material that the applicant had given to the Court and without any oral hearing. The applicant was invited to file written submissions on the question of whether the Court should make an order nisi . On 7 December 2004, the applicant filed an amended application under the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), however, he has not filed any written submissions. 5 I propose to deal with this application on the papers. 18 This claim in form may be prima facie capable of attracting relief under the second limb of the Muin ratio decidendi, that is, that the applicant was misled into thinking that favourable country information had been considered by the Tribunal when in fact it had not. However, the material contained in the draft order nisi and the affidavit in support merely amounts to a pleading or assertion of the right to relief. There are no particulars or evidence of facts that would support the grant of the relief claimed. None of the country information is identified. For orders requiring the respondent to show cause why final relief should not be granted, the applicant must provide material showing that there is at least an arguable case for the grant of the final relief claimed. 19 On the material before me, the applicant has not made out an arguable case that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error. The application for an order nisi should therefore be dismissed with costs.

Case19870,applied,Commissioner of Taxation v Smith [1981] HCA 10 ; (1981) 147 CLR 578,"There is a large body of authority to the effect that where borrowed money is laid out for the purposes of gaining assessable income this ""furnishes the required connection between the interest paid upon it by the taxpayer and the income derived by [it] from its use"": Ure v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1981) 81 ATC 4100 at 4104; see generally Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro [1926] HCA 58 ; (1926) 38 CLR 153 at 170-171; Hart v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCAFC 222 ; (2002) 121 FCR 206 at [26] - [27] ; reversed by the High Court but not on this point: see [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216. The interest paid is thus ""incidental and relevant"" to the gaining of that income for the purposes of s 51(1) and s 8-1: Ronpibon Tin NL and Tongkah Compound NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 56. I would note in passing that the ""incidental and relevant"" formula is commonly used to describe the necessary connection between the loss or outgoing incurred and the gaining or producing of assessable income, though it has been acknowledged that the formula does not constitute ""an exclusive or exhaustive test"" of the scope of s 51(1) requirement: Lunney v Commissioner of Taxation [1958] HCA 5 ; (1958) 100 CLR 478 at 497. Importantly, for present purposes, as was said by Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ in Commissioner of Taxation v Smith [1981] HCA 10 ; (1981) 147 CLR 578 at 586: ""What is incidental and relevant ... falls to be determined not by reference to the certainty or likelihood of the outgoing resulting in the generation of income but to its nature and character, and generally to its connection with the operations which more directly gain or produce the assessable income."""
Case12406,applied,"Life Airbag Company of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Company (New Zealand) Ltd (Federal Court of Australia, 22 May 1998, unreported)","What this necessarily truncated description makes clear is that the accuracy of the Principal Announcement and the Blackburn Adverse Comments were, and at this stage of the proceedings remain, some of the central issues in the proceedings. It is to these issues that the four new expert reports are directed. However, at no time did any of the defendants inform the Court or ASIC that it intended or even might intend to file and serve these expert reports. Of course, there was no obligation on the directors to file any evidence. MPG, too, could have stood mute, not gone into evidence and simply relied upon whatever positive case the directors ran. But if MPG intended to go into evidence, it was subject to the principles summarised in [11(6)] above. 20 What then did the defendants do? The affidavits exhibiting the reports state that the directors retained Mr Rutter, a geophysicist, on 4 June 2007, Mr Stoker, also a geologist, on 29 November 2007, Mr Lawrence, also a geologist, on 5 February 2008 and Mr Whitehead, on 9 April 2008. Moreover, the affidavit of Mr Whitehead disclosed that a preliminary written response was provided on 24 April 2008, some two weeks before the date for MPG to file and serve its material. The affidavits and reports were filed and served on behalf of the directors under cover of a letter seeking to maintain privilege. The explanation provided by the defendants' counsel for the late filing was that: ... we have flagged to [ASIC] expert reports attacking their expert position when they are not entitled to [such notice]. We've put ourselves at some disadvantage in terms of preparing their expert for them. He at least has a notion of what's coming, without a limitation on it. They are not entitled to that advantage. We were entitled to cross-examine their experts without them knowing what our experts were saying. That was the fact. We've given that away. In the interests of trying to resolve this matter, [ASIC] could have a quick look at it and decide whether they want [to proceed]. 21 That submission was incomplete and not wholly accurate. First, as I have already noted, at the directions hearing on 12 June 2008, what ASIC wanted to know was not about the directors' case, but whether the affidavits and reports from the four experts were intended to form part of MPG's own case at trial. The response from MPG's Senior Counsel was that they were: see [5]. That fact was further reiterated by counsel for the defendants, who not only conceded (properly) that the affidavits and reports were late, but asserted that they were provided ""in the interests of trying to resolve this matter"". The subsequent submission on behalf of the defendants that MPG only intended to rely upon the affidavits if they were ultimately tendered by the directors is rejected. It ignores, first, that the sole reason why the matter came before me for directions on 12 June was to ascertain whether MPG intended to rely on the reports as part of its own case and, secondly, the submissions made by Senior Counsel for MPG in response to those enquiries."

Case15910,followed,NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 208,"These grounds cannot succeed. The facts of this case are quite close to the facts of three unanimous decisions of Full Courts of this Court. The members of each court were different. The decisions are NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 208 (Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ), NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 (French, Emmett and Dowsett JJ) and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 (Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ). In each case the court emphasised the proposition that the task of the Minister, through his delegate, and the Refugee Review Tribunal on appeal, pursuant to s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), is to consider whether they are satisfied that the requirements for the grant of a visa have been satisfied. It will be difficult to achieve the requisite degree of satisfaction if the appellant does not provide sufficient information, such as by not attending a hearing. In the absence of a positive finding of satisfaction, a visa application must be rejected. In NAVX at paragraph [5] the Full Court said this: ""In assessing the adequacy of [the Tribunal's] reasons, it must be kept in mind that the Tribunal had indicated to the appellant that it was unable to find in his favour on the basis of the material in its possession and invited him to attend to provide additional information. Clearly enough, the Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value his short and very vague outline of his basis for fearing persecution in China. Having found that the outline was not sufficient to satisfy it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution, it could do little more than offer him an opportunity to elaborate. When he failed to accept that opportunity, the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application."""
Case14152,followed,Jenkins v NZI Securities Australia Ltd (1994) 124 ALR 605 ,"An important aspect to be considered on the question of the showing of reasonable cause is the application made by Goldspar for an extension of time pursuant to cl 18 of the General Conditions of Contract. I need not set out the relevant correspondence again. There are difficulties of construction of cl 18. It seems that the first two paragraphs apply across the board. The third, fourth and fifth paragraphs relate to what is described as an 'entitlement' to an extension. The sixth paragraph, including the handwritten amendment, relates to an overriding general discretion to grant an extension coupled with an obligation to not unreasonably deny a claim where the event causing the delay is beyond the control of Goldspar. The remainder of the paragraph is general. Leaving aside all other difficulties, I cannot see how Goldspar could have established an 'entitlement' to an extension in the face of the terms of paragraph (v) of the third paragraph. However, the general discretion to extend is a horse of a different colour. The second paragraph describes a wide set of circumstances which would justify notification, which must then be considered with a view to exercising the general discretion coupled with the obligation. In considering that issue Khreich was obliged to do more than merely pursue the interests of the Council he was required to give genuine and bona fide consideration to the factors advanced by Goldspar. (Amann Aviation Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1990) 22 FCR 527 per Davies J at 532; Sheppard J at 542 4, see also Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 54 ; (1991) 174 CLR 64 per Mason CJ and Dawson J at 96 and Gaudron J at 150; and Jenkins v NZI Securities Australia Ltd (1994) 124 ALR 605 discussed below). 193 Clause 25.4 gave to the Council a discretion to terminate. It follows from the findings that have been made that the necessary preconditions to exercise that discretion did not occur. It is also argued that the exercise of that discretion is subject to an implied term as to reasonableness and good faith. This arises in a different context to the similar questions discussed earlier. In Jenkins v NZI Securities Australia Ltd the Full Court considered the following clause: '5.08 On the third anniversary of the first Drawdown Date, the Financier will review the Facility with a view to extending the Repayment Date by a further period of 12 months. If the Financier is prepared to so extend the Repayment Date, it will notify the Company accordingly and request the Company to advise whether it so wishes the Repayment Date to be so extended. Upon receipt of such notice from the Financier, the Company shall advise the Company [sic] within seven (7) days as to whether it wishes the Repayment Date to be extended. If the Company so advises the Financier, the Repayment Date will be extended for a further period of 12 months and otherwise the Repayment Date will remain unaltered.' Beaumont, Gummow and Carr JJ said (at 619): 'We would add that the law would oblige the financier to conduct the review in good faith and, perhaps, also reasonably, in the sense of paying regard to the interests of both parties: Amann Aviation Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1990) 92 ALR 601; 22 FCR 527 at 532, 542 4, affd [1991] HCA 54 ; (1991) 174 CLR 64 at 96, 150; 104 ALR 1; Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works (1992) 26 NSWLR 234 at 280; cf Hughes Bros Pty Ltd v Trustees of Roman Catholic Church for Archdiocese of Sydney (1993) 31 NSWLR 91.' I should follow that guidance and imply a term accordingly. There is an air of unreality in considering breach of that term because, for it to arise, the show cause notice must be taken to have been valid and Goldspar would not have shown reasonable cause. However, I have no doubt that in purporting to rescind the contract the Council was acting pursuant to the determination which had been formed to remove the work from Goldspar and give it to others and so was in breach of the implied term, no matter how it is precisely framed."
Case13513,cited,Pinson v Lloyds and National Provincial Foreign Bank Limited [1941] 2 KB 72,"A pleading must be as brief as the nature of the case allows and contain only a statement of the material facts on which the party relies: O 11 r 3 and O 11 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules (the Rules).

A party, however, must include in the pleading or in some other document the particulars of the party's claim or defence: O 12 r 1. The object of requiring a party to give particulars is to limit the generality of the pleadings so as to inform the party's opponent of the nature of the case which he or she has to meet and to prevent the opponent from being taken by surprise at the trial: Spedding v Fitzpatrick (1887) 38 Ch D 410. The provision of appropriate particulars should mean that unnecessary expense to the parties will be avoided. Particulars, like material facts, should not include the evidence which the party intends to prove his or her case.

Case20129,cited,SZFKL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 931,"In reaching this conclusion, his Honour relied upon observations in SZFKL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 931. 55 His Honour observed that two factors influenced the conclusion that s 424A had no application in the circumstances of the present case. Firstly, the Tribunal had regard to the inconsistencies per se in the two versions of events proffered by the Appellant rather than acting in reliance upon an acceptance of information contained in the Appellant's protection visa application as information forming part of the reason for affirming the decision of the Respondent's Delegate. Secondly, the Appellant gave evidence at a hearing before the Tribunal in the course of which information concerning the Appellant's personal details, educational achievements and employment history was tested. These matters were specifically put to the Appellant. 56 Thus, in his Honour's view, the Appellant provided the relevant information to the Tribunal itself for the purposes of the review of the decision of the Respondent's Delegate. On that footing, the information was given by the Appellant to the Tribunal for the purposes of the application before the Tribunal as contemplated by s 424A(3)(b). 57 The feature of the ground of appeal going to s 424A which is decisive of the appeal is this. 58 By the Appellant's letter to the Tribunal dated 12 March 2004, in the context of the Appellant's application to the Tribunal for a review of the Delegate's decision, the Appellant contended that the Delegate had not considered all of his claims 'fairly and carefully' and that as a result of factual matters set out in the letter, the 'obvious' conclusion open was that, 'the decision-maker has never ever carefully considered my claims and he has never ever understood my circumstances correctly' . 59 In the context of an application to the Tribunal to undertake the jurisdictional task of reviewing the decision of the Respondent's Delegate, these statements of the Appellant can only be construed as an express request by the Appellant of the Tribunal to gather together before the Tribunal all of the documents and information describing the circumstances, facts and contentions going to the Appellant's claim for a protection visa including all material before the First Respondent's Delegate and to review that material so as to reach a focused, informed and accurate assessment for itself of the strengths and weaknesses of the claim to a well-founded fear of persecution. Such a request might be described as a republication but its proper character is an express request of the Tribunal to descend into the merits of the claim and to properly have regard to all of the facts, circumstances and contentions which are said by the Appellant to be persuasive of the Appellant's claim of a well-founded fear of persecution. In determining that question in the exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Tribunal must necessarily have regard to all of the information put to the First Respondent by the Appellant in connection with the application for a protection visa. 60 In so doing, the Tribunal acts conformably with the express request of the Appellant. 61 In those circumstances, information that the Tribunal considers to be a part of the reason for affirming the decision by reason of its utility in determining whether there are inconsistencies in the versions given by the Appellant, is information given by the Appellant to the Tribunal for the purposes of s 424A(3)(b) and there is thus no obligation under s 424A(1) to give particulars of that information drawn from the Appellant's protection visa application to the Appellant so as to provide the Appellant with an invitation to comment on it. 62 No contentions have been addressed to the Court in relation to s 425 of the Act."
Case22501,cited,Applicant S v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387,"The Tribunal did consider in some detail the question of the alleged membership of a particular social group. The Tribunal set out the tests to be applied in consideration of the determination and membership of a particular social group. It cited and applied the tests set out in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 and Applicant S v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387. It identified the claimed group as being ' Tamil persons who borrow monies from loan sharks in Malaysia ' or ' persons who borrow money from loan sharks ' or ' persons who are unable to repay debts to loan sharks '. 7 The second issue raised by the appellant is whether the Tribunal formulated the correct test in determining whether there was in existence the claimed particular social group and whether the appellant feared persecution for that reason. It is not suggested that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in principle in its application of the test set out in Applicant S at [36] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ. The Tribunal took into account the High Court's characterisation of a particular social group and relevant country information. It found nothing to enable it to be satisfied that the activities complained of by the appellant would be other than one of many such criminal activities causing concern to the Malaysian authorities, as such activities cause concern in many countries. 8 The Tribunal concluded that none of the country information satisfied it that a social group similar to that suggested by the appellant would be ' identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group ' or that the relevant ' characteristic or attribute would distinguish the group from society at large ' in order for them to be a social group for the purposes of the Convention. Accordingly, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant would be persecuted for reason of his membership of a particular social group. 9 The appellant has not demonstrated that the Tribunal applied the wrong test."
Case2890,cited,Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 62 ; (1989) 169 CLR 379,"The notice of appeal alleged a number of jurisdictional errors. First, it was contended that the Tribunal erred in adopting an unduly harsh approach to the requirement that there be a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, and more particularly, that the Tribunal did not apply the 'real chance' test enunciated in cases such as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 and Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 62 ; (1989) 169 CLR 379 (' Chan' ). Those cases require both a subjective apprehension of persecution and an apprehension that is grounded in objective reality. This has been described as a 'real chance' of persecution, namely, a chance that is not remote or insubstantial or a far-fetched possibility: see Chan at 389, 398, 407 and 429. Secondly, the notice of appeal contended that the Tribunal made errors in its assessment of 'serious harm' as embodied in s 91R(1)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Thirdly, the notice of appeal contended that the Tribunal erred by basing its findings on country information concerning the Naxalite movement, rather than on information provided by the appellant. The fourth ground of appeal was that the Tribunal misdirected itself by failing to correctly identify the appellant's social and political group, which was described as a non-violent segment of the Naxalite movement. Finally, the notice of appeal raised a contention that the Tribunal was biased. This contention appears to be largely premised upon the way in which the Tribunal questioned the appellant and then proceeded to reach conclusions as to his credibility."
Case15338,referred to,Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177,"s 52 of the Trade Practices Act to be enlivened it is sufficient that the conduct complained of, in all the circumstances, answers the statutory description, that is to say, that it is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. It is unnecessary to go further and establish that any actual or potential consumer has taken or is likely to take any positive step in consequence of being misled or deceived. That is not to say that evidence of actual misleading or deception and of steps taken in consequence thereof is not likely to be both relevant and important on the question of whether the relevant conduct in fact answers the statutory description and as to the relief, if any, which should be granted (per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ in Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 ('Taco Bell') at 199). In Taco Bell at 200, Deane and Fitzgerald JJ emphasised that 'no conduct can mislead or deceive unless the representee labours under some erroneous assumption' (cited with approval in Campomar at [104]). Conduct which produces or contributes to confusion or uncertainty may or may not be misleading or deceptive for the purposes of s 52. Ordinarily, a tendency to cause confusion or uncertainty will not suffice to establish conduct of the type described in s 52. The question whether particular conduct causes confusion or wonderment cannot be substituted for the question whether the conduct answers the statutory description contained in s 52 (per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ in Taco Bell at 201; see also Campomar at [106]). As to whether conduct may be categorised as misleading or deceptive Deane and Fitzgerald JJ said in Taco Bell at 202: 'Irrespective of whether conduct produces or is likely to produce confusion or misconception, it cannot, for the purposes of s 52 , be categorized as misleading or deceptive unless it contains or conveys, in all the circumstances of the case, a misrepresentation. The difficulty which will commonly arise in a s 52 case is in determining whether the conduct contains or conveys, in all the circumstances, a misrepresentation and in assessing the significance to that question of evidence that one or more persons were in fact led into error. In extreme, but not necessarily infrequent, cases, it may be correct to hold that, as a matter of law, conduct said to contravene s 52 is incapable of conveying the untrue meaning alleged or any other false meaning. Such cases aside, whether or not conduct amounts to a misrepresentation is a question of fact to be decided by considering what is said and done against the background of all surrounding circumstances. In some cases, such as an express untrue representation made only to identified individuals, the process of deciding that question of fact may be direct and uncomplicated. ...'

In Dalleagles , Anderson J said at 332 333 that professional discourse in a professional capacity between a solicitor and his client with reference to the transactions covered by his instructions should be regarded as prima facie for the purpose of giving and receiving advice. In his Honour's view, this would apply to any communication that is on its face a communication of a professional nature from the solicitor to the client or his agent touching the subject matter of the solicitor's engagement and any communication from the client to the solicitor in connection with that engagement.

Case23638,considered,CBS Songs Limited v Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC [1988] 1 AC 1013 ,"I turn to the decision of the House of Lords in CBS Songs Limited v Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC [1988] 1 AC 1013. The facts appear sufficiently from the head note as follows: 'The plaintiffs, suing on behalf of themselves and other copyright owners in the music trade, claimed that the defendants, by manufacturing, advertising and offering for sale hi-fi systems with facilities for, inter alia, recording at high speed from pre-recorded cassettes onto blank tapes, had authorised and incited members of the public to infringe their copyrights, were joint infringers with such members of the public and were in breach of a duty of care owed to the copyright owners not to supply the machines without taking such precautions as would reasonably ensure that the copyrights would not be infringed by their use. They sought an injunction to retrain the defendants from parting with possession of the machines, or any like machines, without taking such precautions.' 158 At 600, Gummow J (Gaudron J concurring) also identified the decision in The ""Koursk"" as defining joint liability for the purposes of Australian law. At 601 602, his Honour distinguished the decision in CBS Songs on its fact but did not doubt its correctness. 162 Hobhouse LJ subsequently referred to The ""Koursk"" , CBS Songs and Unilever , concluding (at 46) that these cases established that: 'It is only conduct which comes into the first or the third of the categories I have set out above which constitute the commission of a tort.

Case20048,cited,Zhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc [2004] FCA 1392,"In conformity with this too, it has been held that an application for compensation under the no-fault compensation scheme established by the Accident Compensation Act 1985 (Vic) does not fall within s 659(2)(e); rather it is merely a claim for compensation: see Jennings v Salvation Army (2003) 128 IR 366 at 370-371 per Marshall J approved in Zhang at 352; see also Zhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc [2004] FCA 1392 at [15] per Finkelstein J. 128 In Zhang the Full Court indicated that, whilst the filing of a complaint and participation in proceedings must involve alleged violation of laws or regulations by the employer, recourse to competent administrative authorities need not: see Zhang at [23]; contra Zhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc [2004] FCA 1392 at [3] per Finkelstein J. This conclusion is consistent with the structure of s 659(2)(e) (and art 5(c) of the Termination of Employment Convention) as well as the history of the formulation of art 5(c): see [103] above. If, however, recourse to competent administrative authorities must also involve alleged violation of laws or regulations, then this element is also satisfied. This is because Mr Claveria alleged, in substance, that Mr Dunstan was bullying and harassing him. This conduct involved an allegation of violation of s 21 of the OHS Act."
Case11961,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1678,"Mr Bannon submitted that this construction of s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act was supported by several matters. &#8226; First, s 45(4) of the TP Act, a deeming provision, assumes that a corporation which is potentially the subject of an allegation that it has contravened s 45(2)(b)(ii) must have been party to the original arrangement. &#8226; Secondly, the definition of ' give effect to ' in s 4 of the TP Act also appears to be drafted on the assumption that only a party to the arrangement can do an act in pursuance of or in accordance with a provision of the arrangement. &#8226; Thirdly, the authorities indicate that a corporation can give effect to a provision in an arrangement independently of that corporation's motive. It would create an unrealistic burden on corporations (so Mr Bannon argued) if their conduct could give effect to an anti-competitive provision in an arrangement without the corporation being a party to the arrangement or realising that its actions constitute a contravention of the TP Act: Tradestock Pty Ltd v TNT (Management) Pty Ltd (1978) 32 FLR 420, at 432, per Smithers J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1678 , at [294], per Merkel J."
Case9897,distinguished,Statham v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 20 ATR 228,"The appellant desired that I determine the ultimate issue myself. The appellant relied on the approach taken in Statham v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 20 ATR 228. The question for determination in Statham was strikingly different from the question whether a person is the prescribed fit and proper person. As I have said, the determination of this issue involves an evaluation of many factors. Such an evaluation is quite different from determining the application of s 25(1) or s 26(a) of the Act to undisputed facts as was the case in Statham . To proceed in the way now pressed by the appellant would require an assessment of the appellant, and I have not had the advantage of seeing him in the witness box, being able to ask questions of him, or to make a proper evaluation of the type the relevant provisions require. 22 The appellant pressed that I could receive further evidence from the appellant, and then determine the matter of whether he is the prescribed fit and proper person. It was submitted that it was convenient and appropriate that I make whatever further findings of fact necessary, and take into account any further evidence of the appellant. 23 The appellant further contended that he would not be able to afford legal representation should the matter be remitted, and there would be an unacceptable delay if the matter were remitted. 28 Despite the history of this proceeding, in my view, it would not be convenient or appropriate for the Court to finally dispose of the matter in accordance with the power under ss 44(4) , 44 (5), (7) and (8) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) and the approach taken in Statham 20 ATR 228. I propose to make an order for remittal to the Tribunal. I certify that the preceding twenty-eight (28) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.

Case734,referred to,Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223,"Mr Armitage is now an unrepresented litigant and has been so since Mr Liberoginnias ceased to represent him on 27 April 2005. Prior to that date, he had legal representation. Like many unrepresented litigants, he is impecunious. Generally speaking, courts are more reluctant to make orders for indemnity costs against litigants in person than against legally represented litigants, although, in an appropriate case, they will make such an order: see Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [57] and [60] per O'Loughlin, Whitlam and Marshall JJ.

The Court's power to accept an undertaking is constrained by the limits of its power to make an order to similar effect as the undertaking. The Court's power to make an order that a contravener comply with a compliance programme is contained in s 80 or s 86C of the Act. As far as s 80 is concerned, a training programme may go no further than the contravening conduct, or, it seems, that Part of the Act in which the section contravened appears: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 197; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 at 88-90 [25], [26] and [36] per French J.

Case7294,cited,"Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH v Owners of Ship ""Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya"" and Anor (1997) 79 FCR 71","notice to produce. The provision in the Federal Court Rules in relation to notices to produce is O 33 r 12. That rule provides: (1) Where a party to any proceedings serves on another party notice, in accordance with Form 45, requiring the party served to produce at any trial or hearing in the proceedings, or before any Judge, officer, examiner or other person having authority to take evidence in the proceedings any document or thing for the purpose of evidence and the document or thing is in the possession, custody or power of the party served, the party served shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, produce the document or thing in accordance with the notice, without the need for any subpoena for production. (2) Where the document or thing required to be produced in accordance with subrule (1) is not produced, the party serving the notice may lead secondary evidence of the contents or nature of the document or thing. (3) Subrule (2) does not affect the power of the Court to order costs against a party who fails to comply with a notice under subrule (1). Some principles have emerged in relation to notices to produce under O 33 r 12 from prior authorities. It is accepted that a notice to produce, properly issued in terms of O 33 r 12, has the same coercive effect as a subpoena. There is also authority that a notice to produce may be used even in respect of an interlocutory hearing. Though examples are to be found of such use it may perhaps require reconsideration at some stage in light of the remarks made in the Full Court in Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH v Owners of Ship ""Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya"" and Anor (1997) 79 FCR 71 at 93D (Bremerhaven), where the Full Court makes reference to adjectival rules to be applied at the hearing, being those appropriate to a final hearing. I proceed, though, on the basis that the desired use of a notice to produce by Mr Joyce to secure the production of particular documents for use in relation to the application to be heard on 14 December 2009 is, at least in theory, permissible under the Rules even though the application to be heard that day is not a final hearing. I note that in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428 , Hely J at 442, having voiced his general agreement with observations made by Hill J in relation to notices to produce, stated: Contestable issues of fact may arise in proceedings under O 15A for preliminary discovery."

Case22426,cited,Sampi on behalf of the Bardi and Jawi People v Western Australia [2005] FCA 777,"to the possible exception referred to above, I am satisfied that, generally, the evidence supports the inference contended for by the Yawuru claimants of exclusive possession and occupation of the Yawuru claim area (excluding the intertidal zone) where there has been no extinguishment. However, for the reasons given by French J in Sampi on behalf of the Bardi and Jawi People v Western Australia [2005] FCA 777 at [1072] , the right should be limited to exclusive possession and occupation and should not extend to the broader concepts of 'use and enjoyment'. I also agree with his Honour that the right claimed to 'speak for' the land and to make decisions about its use and enjoyment by others is also subsumed in the global right of exclusive possession and occupation."
Case21150,referred to,Griffiths v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 903,"The applicants submitted that there was no basis for distinguishing Alyawarr and that it was binding on this Court. The applicants referred also to the decision of Weinberg J in Griffiths v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 903 ("" Timber Creek Case ""), in which his Honour had regarded himself as bound by the Full Court's conclusion in Alyawarr in relation to the issue of whether the proclamation of Timber Creek as a town disengaged s 47B. Timber Creek, like the town of Newcastle Waters, was a working town and not a paper town like Hatches Creek, the town concerned in Alyawarr . In the Timber Creek Case , Weinberg J said (at [677] [678]): The factual matrix under which s 47B must be considered in the present case differs somewhat from that which applied in Alyawarr . The proclamation constituting and defining the boundaries of Timber Creek, and setting aside Crown lands within the town boundaries so declared as town lands, was dated 10 May 1975. It was made under s 111 of the Ordinance, the same provision that authorised the proclamation of Hatches Creek. The Timber Creek proclamation was published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette on 10 June 1975. As the Full Court noted in Alyawarr, judges at first instance have differed on the application of s 47B to areas within the boundaries of towns constituted by proclamation. In Hayes , Olney J was content to apply the section to unalienated and unreserved Crown land in the town of Alice Springs. In Daniel, however, RD Nicholson J observed that the section would not apply to the town site of Karratha because the proclamation of a site for a town would involve ""a public purpose"", as well as ""a particular purpose"". However, because there was no claim to the town site in Daniel (which was, in any event, covered by a reserve) his Honour's comments regarding s 47B were dicta. 237 His Honour continued (at [699] to [700]): Counsel for the Northern Territory did not have the benefit of the considered views of the Full Court in Alyawarr at the time these submissions were made. Plainly, they are at odds with the reasoning of the Full Court. As previously mentioned, Alyawarr was the subject of an unsuccessful application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. Hayne J described the reasoning of the Full Court as 'not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant a grant of special leave to appeal to this Court'. I am of course bound by the decision of the Full Court in Alyawarr. As I was a member of that Full Court, it is hardly surprising that I regard the decision as correct. To the extent that Daniel reflects a different approach to the construction of s 47B, I must respectfully decline to follow that decision. It follows that s 47B(1)(b)(ii) is no impediment to the operation of s 47B in these proceedings."
Case12552,cited,Attorney-General v Ross [1986] 1 WLR 252,"The starting point in determining the essential object of an institution is its constitution or articles of association. However, this will not always be determinative since ""[t]he skill of Chancery draftsmen is well able to produce a constitution of charitable flavour intended to allow the pursuit of aims of a non-charitable or dubiously charitable flavour"": Attorney-General v Ross [1986] 1 WLR 252 at 263 per Scott J. Similarly, the constitution of a legitimate charity may be drafted in such a way as to obscure that legitimacy, whether through the inexperience of the drafter, the mistaken belief that the organisation's charitable nature will never be questioned, or otherwise. Where it is unclear from the listed objects of an organisation what its main purpose is, or where the evidence shows that the listed objects do not reflect the actual purpose of the organisation, it is appropriate to look to the activities of the organisation together with the expressed objects. In my view, this is not a case where the listed objects leave it unclear what is the main purpose of the organisation. Nor is there evidence that the stated objects do not reflect the actual purpose of Word. The first six objects in paragraph (a) of the objects (set out above at [9]) are clearly related to Word's evangelising activities. As for the remaining objects, I am satisfied, as was the Tribunal, that their comprehensive nature is more likely to reflect a degree of caution on the part of the drafter to ensure that no necessary or desirable act would be prohibited because of an unintended omission from the list. 29 The Tribunal's finding in respect of the period from 1986 or 1987 to the establishment of Bethel Funerals in 1996 was as follows: ""Between 1986 or 1987 and 1996, the sole activity of the applicant was the generation of income from interest earned on deposits from individuals seeking to support those fund raising activities. Its constituent documents prohibited distribution to members of the company and the income generated was applied solely for the benefits of [Wycliffe] as the primary recipient with small contributions to other similar religious organisations. It pursued those objectives solely in Australia and, as such, satisfied the requirements of Item 1.1 of s 50-5 and s 50-50(a) of the Act and was entitled to be endorsed as exempt from income tax for that period as an institution for the advancement of religion."" 30 This finding raises three questions of law which the Commissioner says, for the purposes of the period from 2002, were answered erroneously by the Tribunal. The first is the Commissioner's submission that there was insufficient evidence for the Tribunal to conclude that the payments made by Word to Wycliffe and other organisations were used by them for charitable purposes. No such conclusion expressly appears in the Tribunal's reasons but I agree with the Commissioner's submission that that is the only basis on which the Tribunal could have concluded that Word's activities were charitable."

Case867,followed,Moradian v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 (2004) 142 FCR 170,"To the extent to which Lay Lat might be taken to be authority on the meaning and effect of s 357A of the Migration Act , it does not bind me to hold that Ms Antipova's only entitlement to procedural fairness is to be found in the meagre provisions of Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act . In my view, to the extent that it suggests that s 422B excludes all principles of procedural fairness, other than those found in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Migration Act , VXDC is fundamentally wrong. The obiter remarks in Lay Lat are entitled to great respect, appearing as they do in a considered judgment of a Full Court, but I cannot bring myself to accept that they are correct. For the reasons I gave in Moradian v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 (2004) 142 FCR 170 at [28] , I remain of the view that the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with', appearing in each of ss 51A , 357A and 422B of the Migration Act are intended to qualify the words preceding them, and to reduce what would otherwise be the absolute effect of those exclusionary words. If this were not the case, the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with' would be otiose, and it is not to be supposed that Parliament intended to enact meaningless, surplus words in a crucial amendment. The words are not the 'plain words of necessary intendment' required to exclude the requirements of procedural fairness. See Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, and the authorities there cited. It is highly unlikely that Parliament had in mind all of the myriad ways in which procedural fairness, a concept the content of which is dependent on the circumstances of each case, could arise. The present case forms a good example of what would result if the view expressed in Lay Lat were to be followed. Assuming that s 360(1) of the Migration Act does not have the meaning that it has in my view, the Tribunal could reduce the time of a hearing arbitrarily as much as it chose, interrupt and curtail the evidence of the applicant constantly, and deprive the applicant of any opportunity to put his or her case, and the applicant would have no redress. It is impossible to imagine that Parliament intended such a drastic result. 98 To the extent to which the views expressed in VXDC and Lay Lat are said to be based on a reading of the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech relating to the bill by which ss 51A , 357A and 422B were introduced into the Migration Act , I repeat the view I expressed in Moradian at [35]. Those documents do not contain statements specific enough to resolve any ambiguity in those provisions, or to disclose a purpose specific enough to warrant a construction of the provisions that would regard them as excluding the entirety of the principle of procedural fairness described as the 'natural justice hearing rule'."

The third step must therefore be taken without reference to any SoP, in accordance with the approach summarised in Byrnes v Repatriation Commission [1993] HCA 51 ; (1993) 177 CLR 564, at 571, per curiam : 'The position may be summarized as follows: (1) First, sub-s.

The hypothesis will not be reasonable if it is contrary to known scientific facts or is obviously fanciful or untenable. If the hypothesis is not reasonable, the claim fails. Proof of facts is not in issue at this point. (2) If a reasonable hypothesis is established, sub-s. (1) of s. 120 is applied. The claim will succeed unless: (a) one or more of the facts necessary to support the hypothesis are disproved beyond reasonable doubt; or (b) the truth of another fact in the material, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis, is proved beyond reasonable doubt, thus disproving, beyond reasonable doubt, the hypothesis'.

Reference was made to what was said by Gummow and Hayne JJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats (2001) 208 CLR 199 at 246. In an appropriate case, so much may be conceded. Reference was also made to what was said by Williams J in dissent in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v United Aircraft Corporation [1943] HCA 50 ; (1943) 68 CLR 525 at 546. 23 Spirits submitted that FKP's motion for leave to amend its FACC by filing a pleading in the form of the draft SFACC should be refused for the following three reasons: (a) FKP's proposed amendment is so obviously futile that it would be struck out had it appeared in the original pleading; there were at least two elements to this an alleged mistaken reliance on s 44 of the Act and the absence of any pleading that, by making the trade mark applications, Spirits has invaded any presently existing legal or equitable right of FKP, or has breached any alleged obligation owed to FKP, such as would be necessary to attract any principle in the terms stated in Lenah Game Meats ; (b) to allow the amendment would lead to substantial prejudice being suffered by Spirits which could not be cured by an order for costs, because registration of the trade mark applications would be held up indefinitely, pending the outcome of this (already lengthy and complicated) proceeding; and (c) there are powerful considerations militating against an exercise of the Court's discretion in favour of allowing the amendment. 24 Each of these reasons was elaborated on in Spirits' written and oral submissions, but it is the reliance on s 44 of the Act in the pleadings which are at the forefront of Spirits' argument which is put in the following way. 25 Paragraphs [68] [70] of the draft SFACC, which lead up to para [71] plead that: (a) the Stolichnaya trade mark applications are substantially identical with or deceptively similar to each of the Stolichnaya Label Mark, the Stolichnaya Word Mark, the Stoli Word Mark, the Ohranj Label Mark, the Ohranj Word Mark and the Blue Salyt Mark ('the Stolichnaya currently disputed marks') (para [68] of the draft SFACC); (b) the Stolichnaya trade mark applications are in relation to similar goods to the Stolichnaya currently disputed marks (para [69] of the draft SFACC); and (c) each of the Stolichnaya trade mark applications has a priority date which is not earlier than the priority date for the Stolichnaya currently disputed marks (para [70] of the draft SFACC)."

Case12616,followed,Johnston v Cameron [2002] FCA 948,"Although there has been no direct judicial consideration of the term ""publication"" in relation to s 50 applications, there appears to be a consensus emerging in the cases on s 50 that this section ""deals expressly with the prevention of information given in open court from entering the wider public arena""; see Computer Interchange Pty Ltd and Another v Microsoft Corp and Another [1999] FCA 198 ; (1999) 88 FCR 438 per Madgwick J at [15]. The word ""domain"" has also been used interchangeably with ""arena""; see generally Johnston v Cameron [2002] FCA 948 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v X [2005] FCAFC 217 ; (2005) 147 FCR 243. In each of these cases, the entering of particular evidence or the name of a party into ""the wider public arena"" or ""domain"" contemplates an act of publication and audience much broader than the limited inspection (and not copying) of documents at the Court Registry by Ms Gee, Mr Agnew and Ms Meredith. 17. The underlying assumption of s 50 is the principle of open justice. The fact that the order must be necessary to prevent prejudice suggests that the party seeking to invoke a power of suppression carries a very heavy onus; see Madgwick J in Computer Interchange at [16] and Weinberg J in Johnston v Cameron at [89]. As such, the Court must consider the alleged prejudice that would be suffered by the respondent should the s 50 order not be granted. The Court must also determine whether the order is necessary to prevent this prejudice and whether this warrants a departure from the ordinary rule that open justice occur."

By an amended notice of motion filed on 30 March 2007, Worimi seeks to be joined as a respondent to this non-claimant application under s 84(5) of the Act. The application for joinder is opposed by the Land Council."
Case6922,followed,EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No. 2) (1998) 160 ALR 382,"I also propose to make an order that the respondent pay to each of the persons it employed at the Victorian Arts Centre the amount agreed to be outstanding. To each amount there should be added interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act. In this respect, the applicant's claim is modest. Because of the difficulty of calculation of interest when it is payable on a series of payments that were due over a long period, the applicant has asked for interest only from 1 June 2003, ie. on the total sum owed to each employee in respect of the two periods claimed. The applicant calculated that interest only up to the date when the case was being heard. It should be calculated to the date of judgment. As to the rate, the applicant sought interest at 11 per cent per annum, that being the operative rate at 1 June 2003, pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rate Act 1983 (Vic). It is appropriate to choose that rate for the reasons advanced in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No. 2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 at 384, and Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1406 at [91] . The rate of interest was increased to 11.25 per cent from 26 June 2003, and to 12 per cent from 1 July 2004, but counsel for the applicant forwent any entitlement to a rate greater than 11 per cent. The order that I make for payment to each employee will therefore include an amount of interest on the sum owing to that employee at 1 June 2003, at the rate of 11 per cent per annum (non-compounding), from 1 June 2003 to the date of judgment."
Case16650,cited,Commissioner of Taxation v Reliance Carpet Co Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 22,"too applied what Dixon CJ had said in Rawson 107 CLR at 481, see Foran 168 CLR at 425. When Brennan J referred to an entitlement to rescind, he used 'rescind' in the sense of one party electing to terminate for breach or repudiation by the other, as explained in Commissioner of Taxation v Reliance Carpet Co Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 22 at [2] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ."
Case16136,considered,Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 204 ALR 26,"It is premature, in my view, to give detailed consideration to whether the Statement of Claim adequately pleads an appropriate nexus between the losses allegedly suffered by Dr Wearne and the relief claimed by her. I note, however, that the High Court observed with respect to the Trade Practices Act in Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 204 ALR 26 at [45] : 'The Act's references to ""loss or damage"" can be given no narrow meaning. Section 4K of the Act provides that loss or damage includes a reference to injury. It follows that the loss or damage spoken of in ss 82 and 87 is not confined to economic loss. What kinds of detriment constitute loss or damage, when a detriment is to be identified as occurring or likely to occur, and what remedies are to be awarded, may all raise further difficult questions. Especially is that so when it is recalled that remedies may be awarded to compensate, prevent or reduce loss or damage that has been or is likely to be suffered by conduct in contravention of the Act.' (citation omitted) 39 I am not satisfied that Dr Wearne does not have a reasonable cause of action, or reasonable causes of action, against the University. The application for the proceeding to be dismissed or permanently stayed therefore fails. 40 However, I conclude that the Statement of Claim does not comply with the rules of pleading. Its deficiencies are so extensive that it would be counterproductive, in my view, for individual paragraphs or groups of paragraphs to be struck out. The Statement of Claim will therefore be wholly struck out. However, in my view it is appropriate that Dr Wearne have one final opportunity to plead her case against the University."
Case7107,cited,Paxus Services Ltd v People Bank Pty Ltd (1990) 99 ALR 728,"The main issue that was argued before me was whether, within the meaning of O 15A r 6, there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have the right to obtain relief from KPMG. On this question, some preliminary observations can be made: &#8226; It is necessary to examine the various elements of the potential cause of action that is sought to be relied upon to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that each of the necessary elements exist. That task requires the Court to conclude at least that there is a reasonable cause to believe that each of the elements of the relevant cause of action might be established. The test is an objective one, and it is not necessary to prove that each of the elements do in fact exist. The rule contemplates that there be reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have a right to obtain relief: see Austrac Operations Pty Ltd v New South Wales [2003] ATPR 41-960 at [11] and Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Page Kirkland Management Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 288 at [5] . &#8226; If the cause of action on which an application for preliminary discovery is based could not succeed, is bound to fail, is ill-founded or is doomed to fail, then discovery ought not be ordered: Bradley v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1989] 1 All ER 961 at 963 to 964; Harris v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Health Authority [1989] 2 All ER 273 at 277. If the potential cause of action would not survive an application for summary judgment pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ('Federal Court Act'), then discovery ought not to be ordered. &#8226; ""Belief"" under O 15A r 6 requires more than mere assertion, a ""hunch"", conjecture or suspicion. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition: see: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 at [13] to [14]; St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 154. &#8226; The availability of preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6 depends upon the evidence before the Court. . The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter of fact in question: see Austrac Operations [2003] ATPR at [37]; John Holland Services [2004] FCA at [13] to [14], [17] and [73] and St George v Rabo 211 ALR at 154. &#8226; The rule is one which should be construed beneficially. In Paxus Services Ltd v People Bank Pty Ltd (1990) 99 ALR 728 at 733 Burchett J said: It is no answer to the applicant's application under r 6 to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a fishing expedition: cf Meth v Norbert Steinhardt &amp; Son Ltd (1959) 33 ALJR 78 at 81. Rule 6 is designed to enable an applicant, in a situation where his proof can rise no higher than the level the rule describes, to ascertain whether he has a case against the prospective respondent -- that is, to ""fish"" in the old sense... It would be unfortunate if a rule designed to amplify the court's power to penetrate obscurities and uncertainties in the interests of justice were to be weakened by restrictive and unnecessary glosses. I think the rule is of a beneficial kind within the meaning of the well known principle of interpretation, and should be given the fullest scope its language will reasonably allow. The proper brake on any excesses in its use is the discretion of the court, which is required to be exercised in the particular circumstances of each case. See also CGU Insurance Ltd v Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad (2001) 187 ALR 279 at [23] per Tamberlin J. 77 The respondents relied upon a report of John Stewart of BDO Kendalls dated 19 April 2007 in an endeavor to demonstrate breach (and causation). I appreciate that no evidence has been adduced by KPMG and inferences may be drawn from a failure to call evidence in the appropriate case (see Paxus Services 99 ALR at 732 to 733), but this does not excuse the respondents from demonstrating that there is a reasonable cause to believe there may be an entitlement to relief. 78 Mr Stewart set out the following matters he was asked to address: &#8226; ""My opinion as to whether there is, on a prima facie basis, reason to think that the financial reports of [York Street] and [Market Street] for the periods ended 31 December 2002, 30 June 2003, 31 December 2003 and 30 June 2004 (""enclosed financial reports"") do not disclose a true and fair view of the financial position of [York Street] and [Market Street] "" ; &#8226; ""If I determine that, on a prima facie basis, there are reasons to believe the financial reports of [York Street] and [Market Street] do not disclose a true and fair view of the financial position of what audit issues, in my opinion, appear relevant in considering the financial position of the companies: for instance, is there an issue as to whether the balance sheets of [York Street] and [Market Street] should have included a provision for doubt as to the recoverability of the loans to, respectively, Scots Church Development Ltd and 60 Market Street Trust"" ; and &#8226; ""Advice as to what KPMG documents I would require access to, to enable me to provide an expert opinion as to whether or not the KPMG audits of the financial reports of [York Street] and [Market Street] were carried out with due skill and care for each of the years ended 30 June 2002, 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004"". 79 In the report, Mr Stewart: (a) examined the reports to creditors prepared by the liquidators of York Street and Market Street; (b) looked at York Street's financial reports for the year ended 30 June 2003; and (c) looked at Market Street's financial reports for the periods ending 31 December 2002, 30 June 2003, 31 December 2003 and 30 June 2004. 103 Ultimately, the question of whether discovery should be ordered is a matter involving the exercise of judicial discretion. The discretion is to be exercised having regard to the particular circumstances of each case: see Paxus Services 99 ALR at 733 to 734; Minister for Health and Aged Care v Harrington Associates Ltd [1999] FCA 549 at [27] ."

Similarly, where the applicant makes its own inquiries or retained its own advisers to ascertain the true position there is some authority that reliance on the impugned conduct is negated: cf The Australian William E Simon Graduate School of Business Administration Incorporated v Minister Administering the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (NSW) (1994) 51 FCR 243."
Case14660,approved,Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49,"the legal advice limb of legal professional privilege, a document will attract privilege if it was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice: Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 ( 'Esso' ) at 64-65 [35]; Daniels Corporations International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 ( 'Daniels' ) at 552 [9]. The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows: (1) The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken, or the document was brought into existence, for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice. The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence, or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication, or authored the document, or procured its creation. It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents, supported by argument or submissions: see Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 ( 'Grant v Downs' ) at 689; Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 266 at 278 [30] ( 'FCT v Pratt Holdings' ); and AWB v Cole at [63]. (2) The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively. Evidence of the intention of the document's maker, or of the person who authorised or procured it, is not necessarily conclusive. It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decision-making or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication: see AWB v Cole at [110]. (3) The existence of legal professional privilege is not established merely by the use of verbal formula: Grant v Downs at 689 per Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ. Nor is a claim of privilege established by mere assertion that privilege applies to particular communications or that communications are undertaken for the purpose of obtaining or giving 'legal advice': National Crime Authority v S (1991) 29 FCR 203 at 211 212 per Lockhart J; Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research &amp; Development Board (2005) 223 ALR 284 (' Candacal' ) at 298 [70]; Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2005] FCA 142 at [6] [8]. If assertions of that kind are received in evidence in support of the privilege claim, their conclusionary nature can leave unclear what advice was really being sought. There will be cases in which a claim of privilege will not be sustainable in the absence of evidence identifying the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place and the topics to which the instructions or advice were directed: Kennedy v Wallace [2004] FCAFC 337 ; (2004) 142 FCR 185 ( 'Kennedy v Wallace' ) at 189 190 [12] [17] per Black CJ and Emmett J and at 211 212 [144] [145] and at 215 216 [166] [171] per Allsop J; see also Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Arthur Andersen &amp; Co (No 6) [2001] SASC 398. (4) Where communications take place between a client and his or her independent legal advisers, or between a client's in-house lawyers and those legal advisers, it may be appropriate to assume that legitimate legal advice was being sought, absent any contrary indications: Kennedy v Wallace (2004) 208 ALR 424 at 442 [65] per Gyles J; affirmed on appeal, Kennedy v Wallace at 191-192 [23]-[27] per Black CJ and Emmett J. In Kennedy v Wallace , Black CJ and Emmett J inclined to the view that in the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances, proof of those facts alone will provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that legitimate legal advice is being sought or given. (5) A 'dominant purpose' is one that predominates over other purposes; it is the prevailing or paramount purpose: AWB v Cole at [105]-[106]; FCT v Pratt Holdings at 279-280 [30] per Kenny J. (6) An appropriate starting point when applying the dominant purpose test is to ask what was the intended use or uses of the document which accounted for it being brought into existence: Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at 366 [35] per Finn J. (7) The concept of legal advice is fairly wide. It extends to professional advice as to what a party should prudently or sensibly do in the relevant legal context; but it does not extend to advice that is purely commercial or of a public relations character: Balabel v Air India [1988] 1 Ch 317 ( 'Balabel' ) at 323 and 330; Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV v Bacon and Woodrow [1995] 1 All ER 976 ( 'Nederlandse' ) at 983; Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 6) [2004] UKHL 48 ; [2005] 1 AC 610 ( 'Three Rivers' ) at 652-653 [43]-[44], 657-658 [59]-[60], 681 [114] and 683 [120]; Dalleagles Pty Ltd v Australian Securities Commission (1991) 4 WAR 325 ( 'Dalleagles' ) at 332-333; DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc [2003] FCA 1191 ; (2003) 135 FCR 151 ( 'DSE' ) at 161-173 [25] [71]; and AWB v Cole at [100]-[101]. (8) Legal professional privilege protects the disclosure of documents that record legal work carried out by the lawyer for the benefit of the client, such as research memoranda, collations and summaries of documents, chronologies and the like, whether or not they are actually provided to the client: Daniels at 563 [44] per McHugh J; Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 ( 'Propend' ) at 550 per McHugh J; Dalleagles at 333 334 per Anderson J; Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1979) 36 FLR 244 ( 'Stirling' ) at 245 246 per Lockhart J; and Kennedy v Lyell (1883) 23 Ch D 387 at 407; Lyell v Kennedy (1884) 27 Ch D 1 at 31 per Bowen LJ; Propend Finance Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1995) 58 FCR 224 at 266 per Lindgren J. (9) Subject to meeting the dominant purpose test, legal professional privilege extends to notes, memoranda or other documents made by officers or employees of the client that relate to information sought by the client's legal adviser to enable him or her to advise: Stirling at 246. The privilege extends to drafts, notes and other material brought into existence by the client for the purpose of communication to the lawyer, whether or not they are themselves actually communicated to the lawyer: Saunders v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469 at 472. (10) Legal professional privilege is capable of attaching to communications between a salaried legal adviser and his or her employer, provided that the legal adviser is consulted in a professional capacity in relation to a professional matter and the communications are made in confidence and arise from the relationship of lawyer and client: Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 96 per Dawson J; see also Deane J at 79 82. Some cases have added a requirement that the lawyer who provided the advice must be admitted to practice: see Dawson J in Waterford at 96; GSA Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Constable (2002) 2 Qd R 146 at 150; Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd v Arthur Andersen (2002) 1 Qd R 233 at 245. However, in Commonwealth v Vance (2005) 158 ACTR 47, the Full Court (Gray, Connolly and Tamberlin JJ) did not regard the possession of a current practising certificate as an essential precondition to the availability of legal professional privilege: at [23] [35]. The same view was taken by Lee J in Candacal at 303 [99], by Gillard J in Australian Hospital Care (Pindara) Pty Ltd v Duggan [1999] VSC 131 at [111] , and by Downes J in Re McKinnon and Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [2004] AATA 1365 ; (2004) 86 ALD 780 at 785 [51] . (11) Legal professional privilege protects communications rather than documents, as the test for privilege is anchored to the purpose for which the document was brought into existence. Consequently, legal professional privilege can attach to copies of non-privileged documents if the purpose of bringing the copy into existence satisfies the dominant purpose test: Propend at 507 per Brennan CJ, 544 per Gaudron J, 553-554 per McHugh J, 571-572 per Gummow J, and 587 per Kirby J. In Propend at 512, Brennan CJ added a qualification to this principle: if an original unprivileged document is not in existence or its location is not disclosed or is not accessible to the persons seeking to execute the warrant, and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is made available to prove the contents of the original, the otherwise privileged copy loses its protection. (12) The Court has power to examine documents over which legal professional privilege is claimed. Where there is a disputed claim, the High Court has said that the court should not be hesitant to exercise such a power: Esso ; see also Grant v Downs at 689. If the power is exercised, the court will need to recognise that it does not have the benefit of submissions or evidence that might place the document in its proper context. The essential purpose of such an inspection is to determine whether, on its face, the nature and content of the document supports the claim for legal professional privilege."
Case956,cited,Hagan v Trustees of Toowoomba Sports Grounds Trust [2000] FCA 1615,"The test or standard in s 18C(1)(a) of the Act is objective: see Jones v Scully [2002] FCA 1080 ; (2002) 120 FCR 243 at 268-269; Hagan v Trustees of Toowoomba Sports Grounds Trust [2000] FCA 1615 ; Creek v Cairns Post Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1007 ; (2001) 112 FCR 352 at [12] . It is for the Court to determine whether the act, in all the circumstances in which it was done, would be reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people of a particular racial, national or ethnic group: see Hagan [2000] FCA 1615 at [15] . As Hely J remarked in Scully [2002] FCA 1080 ; (2002) 120 FCR 243 at [99] : ""it is not necessary for an applicant to prove that any person was actually offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated by the conduct in question ... [but] evidence, for example, that a member of a particular racial group was offended by the conduct in question would be admissible, on, but not determinative of, the issue of contravention."""
Case21021,referred to,Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568,"Mrs Perovich contends that a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Federal Magistrate arose in the present case because he had earlier made adverse findings relating to her credit and because there was a significant issue to be decided which depended, if she were to prevail, upon acceptance of her evidence that she was not insolvent. During argument senior counsel accepted that, by reason of the effluxion of time, the Federal Magistrate may well have forgotten that he had earlier made adverse findings concerning Mrs Perovich's credibility. Although Traditional Values had been referred to in the Magistrate's reasons, it was possible that this was because the Magistrate had extracted the case name from Court records without re-reading his reasons. Nonetheless, senior counsel submitted that the reasonable observer, seized of the knowledge that the earlier adverse credit findings had been made, would entertain a reasonable suspicion that the Magistrate would have regard to those findings when resolving credibility issues in the present case. Although the disqualification application had been made only by reference to the Federal Magistrate's earlier refusal to set aside the bankruptcy notice, the application had been made. This was not a case, so the argument ran, in which an applicant with good reason to seek a judge's disqualification stood by in the hope of a favourable decision and only alleged bias once that hope had been disappointed: cf Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 572. 34 Had the resolution of any significant issue in the present case turned on Mrs Perovich's credit, other issues may have arisen as to whether or not Mrs Perovich should be allowed to raise, on appeal, a ground supporting disqualification which could have been, but was not, advanced before the Federal Magistrate: cf Water Board v Moustakas [1988] HCA 12 ; (1988) 180 CLR 491 at 497; Vakauta at 572."
Case15417,considered,Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Hassani (2007) 94 ALD 378,In Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Hassani (2007) 94 ALD 378 there was an objection to jurisdiction under the ADJR Act and the Judiciary Act in an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act. Separate applications were filed. Justice Besanko considered that neither the AAT Act nor the ADJR Act provided the relief sought but made orders under s 39B of the Judiciary Act (at [29] [30]; [32]).
Case23441,considered,Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Limited [2001] FCA 60 ; (2001) 105 FCR 136,"The Court now considers the issue of discovery under Order 15A Rule 6 of the Rules. In Paxus Services Ltd v People Bank Pty Limited (1990) 99 ALR 728 at 733 Burchett J held that Order 15A Rule 6 is to be given a wide operation and construed beneficially: see also Minister for Health and Aged Care v Harrington Associates Ltd [1999] FCA 549 at [27] . Order 15A Rule 6 has been the subject of judicial consideration by the Full Court of this Court in Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Limited [2001] FCA 60 ; (2001) 105 FCR 136. At 143 the Court said: In a number of cases it has been pointed out that O 15A, r 6 (discovery before action) expressly contemplates what once might have been castigated as fishing and that it would be incongruous if the power to order discovery were less extensive in favour of a party to a proceeding properly brought in the Court than in favour of someone unable for lack of evidence to mount a case: Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (1990) 51 IR 113, Trade Practices Commission v CC (NSW) Pty Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 426 at 436 (Lindgren J), Treasurer of the Commonwealth v Canwest Global Communications Corp [1997] FCA 578 (Full Court), Microsoft Corporation v Adelong Electronics Pty Ltd (t/as Ade Computers) [1997] FCA 224 (Burchett J), Bertran v Vanstone [1999] FCA 1753 at [18] - [23] (Kenny J). Donnelly v Davison [2000] FCA 1396 ; (2000) 105 FCR 1 (Branson J). Also one should not lose sight of what the majority of the High Court in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 685 noted as the public interest "" ... which requires that in the interests of a fair trial litigation should be conducted on the footing that all relevant documentary evidence is available."""
Case16306,referred to,Re Smith; ex parte Inspector-General in Bankruptcy [1996] FCA 1076,"The applicants contended that they were not seeking to re-open their case but merely to finish it. Alternatively, they submitted that this was a ""clear case"" in which leave to re-open should be given, since there would be ""no reagitation of any issue"". They also argued that what they termed the ""decision"" of 15 April 2005 was ""in the nature of a determination of a preliminary question"". The applicants submitted that there were numerous factors militating in their favour in any exercise of discretion, including the reasonableness of their reliance on the decision in Re Smith; ex parte Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and Brown [1996] FCA 1076 ("" Re Smith ""), the absence of prejudice to the respondents, the absence of formal pleadings, and public policy. 16 The applicants estimated their loss as $115,348 and sought to recover $100,000 under the bond. They submitted that the Court is not discharged from an obligation to assess loss simply because quantification was ""not a simple exercise"" and was imprecise. In ascertaining the loss that flowed from the breach of the bond, there were, so the applicants said, three relevant questions: (1) what action was required to be taken by them once they became aware of a possible breach of the bond?: (2) What resources were used to take such action?: and (3) How can those resources be valued for the purpose of quantifying a loss? 17 The applicants contended that no issue of managerial time arose, although if it did, they were entitled to recover in respect of such time. They submitted that the employee status of relevant officers did not disentitle the applicants from recovering the costs claimed for them. They contended that ""the value of the time they have spent is the cost of the resources used by the applicants in carrying out their duties following a breach of the bond"". They maintained that they were entitled to recover the costs referable to Bradshaw's prosecution and submitted that the Court could award exemplary damages. 27 There are a number of factors militating in favour of granting the applicants leave to re-open their case. There is a matter of the public interest and public policy involved. There has been a serious breach on Bradshaw's part of his duties as a trustee, which also constituted a breach of the condition of his bond. There was evidence of loss to the Commonwealth before the Court at the first hearing. The Commonwealth has been obliged to investigate Bradshaw's misconduct and has determined to prosecute him for his criminal misconduct. This has involved time and money. If the Commonwealth were able to quantify its loss, then it would be entitled to payment under the bond to the extent of that quantified loss (but not exceeding $100,000). If the Court were to grant leave to re-open, the costs that the respondents have unnecessarily incurred might be met by a costs order in their favour. The evidence that the applicants seek to present concerns an issue that the Court has not previously considered and the respondents have indicated that they would not seek to cross-examine the relevant deponents. The applicants' conduct at the first hearing was explicable by reference the decision in Re Smith , although, as stated in Bradshaw (No 1) at [41], this decision provided only limited guidance. There were no pleadings in which issues of the present kind might have been ventilated prior to the first hearing. Apart from the matter of costs, the respondents identified no prejudice to them if leave were granted, save for the fact that the parties had at all times until the directions of 15 April 2005 proceeded on the basis that the applicants would not and could not quantify the Commonwealth's loss."
Case17750,applied,Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45,"all, a fundamental purpose of the Parliament prescribing the norm of conduct enacted in s 52 of the Act is to ensure the protection of the public, particularly consumers. I reject Austcorp's argument that it did not engage in the conduct of providing to the applicants the brochure, leaflet and their repetitions by Mr Walker. Austcorp was the hands and brains of its subsidiaries' conduct and Austcorp cannot evade responsibility for any contravention of s 52 by seeking to draw down between itself and them a corporate veil for the contraventions it perpetrated: cf: Hamilton 166 CLR at 128; Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 88 [108] . It is important to assess whether a misrepresentation was an operative cause of the decision of a person to enter into a contract. Ordinarily, a person who has made a false representation is under a duty to correct it before the representee acts to his or her detriment in reliance upon it. This is so in cases of fraudulent misrepresentation as Lord Reid explained in Briess v Woolley [1954] AC 333 at 349. Equally, in cases of unintentional contraventions of s 52 of the Act, a representee who relies on an uncorrected misleading representation (even where the representor does not know of the facts which make the representation incorrect) is entitled to relief under Pt VI of the Act: Campomar 202 CLR at 85 [103]. Whether something is a cause of something else is ultimately a question of fact although it can involve considering and applying difficult value judgments. As Gibbs CJ said in Puxu 149 CLR at 199 (see also Campomar (2000) 202 CLR at 85 [102]-[103] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ): ""The heavy burdens which [s 52] create cannot have been intended to be imposed for the benefit of persons who fail to take reasonable care of their own interests. What is reasonable will of course depend on all the circumstances."" The issue for consideration is whether any contravention of s 52 has arisen by the conduct of the promoters in putting forward the brochure and leaflet and authorising Mr Walker to speak as he did consistently with them, when the contract appears to contain different provisions, materially as to the identity of the lessee and the nature of Pacific International Hotels' financial and commercial confidence in the venture promoted. In Campomar 202 CLR at 83 [98], Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ emphasised the need to enquire why any misconception had arisen in the mind of the person claiming have been misled or deceived. A sufficient nexus must exist between the conduct complained of and the misconception or deception. Austcorp argued that the nexus was, in effect, broken because the contract was a legal document which set out with considerable precision and at length the actual relationship that would exist if a person entered into the contract and the lease. For example, it argued that it was not reasonable for a person in the position of Ms Tan-Bounkeua not to have had a solicitor advising her and that, had she done so, the solicitor would have broken the chain of causation, even if he or she negligently failed to advise the purchaser of the provisions of cl 20.9 or the existence of Mustara. I discuss this specific issue below [See 2.18]. Gibbs CJ observed in Puxu [1982] HCA 44 ; 149 CLR 191 at 199 that the Act did not impose burdens which operated for the benefit of persons who failed to take reasonable care of their own interests: see too Campomar 202 CLR at 85 [102]. As explained above, it is necessary to consider whether Austcorp's conduct in making each representation to each of Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeua was misleading or deceptive: Butcher 218 CLR at 604-605 [36]-[37]; Campomar 202 CLR at 85 [103]. It is not necessary to consider the position of Mr and Mrs Di Giulio and Mr Luciani because I have not accepted their evidence that they relied on any of the representations. 5.

Case21693,cited,King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [2000] FCA 1543,"This is an application for interlocutory injunctive relief pending the trial of proceedings which were instituted on 15 February 2006. THE NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS 2 The applicant is an academic at the University of Ballarat (""UB""). He is presently employed as a senior lecturer and course co-ordinator of the Bachelor of Arts (Humanities and Social Sciences) course at the Mt Helen campus of UB. He is a member of the National Tertiary Education Industry Union (""NTEU"") and holds two official positions with it, namely a member of its national council since 1998 and branch president of its UB branch since 2000. 3 The proceedings are brought by the applicant as a representative party pursuant to Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (""the FCA Act ""). According to the application, the group members whom the applicant represents are 'all academic staff and general staff (other than casual academic staff, casual general staff and TAFE general staff)' employed by UB as at 14 February 2006. 4 The proceedings arise out of allegedly misleading statements that were made by UB to its staff members on 14 December 2005 (""the December 2005 statements""). The applicant alleges that the December 2005 statements contravened s 170WG(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (""the WR Act ""), which provides: ""(2) A person must not knowingly make a false or misleading statement to another person with the intention of persuading the other person to make, or not to make, an AWA or ancillary document."" The December 2005 statements were made in the context of UB offering Australian Workplace Agreements (""AWAs"") to its staff. 5 The final relief sought in the proceeding comprises: (a) the imposition of penalties on UB under s 170VV of the WR Act; (b) a declaration that UB contravened s 170WG(2) of the WR Act; (c) injunctions requiring UB to refrain from knowingly making a false or misleading statement to the group members with the intention of persuading them to make an AWA, and to publish a correcting statement; and (d) damages and interest. 6 The applicant seeks the following interlocutory relief pending the hearing and determination of the application or further order: (a) UB refrain from offering, entering into or taking any step to make, formalise, register or have approved an AWA with a group member; (b) UB refrain from knowingly making a false or misleading statement to the group members and/or each of them with the intention of persuading group members and/or each of them to make an AWA; and (c) UB cease contravening s 170WG(2) by publishing to each group member a statement correcting the false and/or misleading statements referred to in the affidavit of the applicant sworn 14 February 2006. BACKGROUND 7 In recent years, the terms and conditions of employment of staff at UB have been governed by an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement known as the University of Ballarat Enterprise Agreement for Academic and General Staff, 2000-2003 (""the EBA""). The EBA was made pursuant to s 170LJ of the WR Act . Although its nominal expiry date was 30 June 2003, the effect of s 170LX is that it continues to govern the terms and conditions of the employment of relevant employees of UB, other than those employees who have subsequently entered into an operative AWA with UB. 8 Between June 2003 and late 2005, various efforts were made by the NTEU and/or UB to introduce a new agreement that would govern the terms and conditions of employment at UB. Initially, the NTEU unsuccessfully sought to negotiate an agreement pursuant to s 170LJ. Subsequently, UB made two unsuccessful attempts to make an agreement directly with its academic and general employees pursuant to s 170LK. The first of these proposed s 170LK agreements went to a ballot of staff members between 17 and 21 October 2005. The ballot rejected the proposed agreement, with 451 staff members voting against the agreement and 335 for it. The second proposed agreement went to a ballot of staff members between 22 and 23 November 2005. Again, the ballot resulted in a rejection of the agreement, with 401 staff members voting against it and 323 voting in favour of it. In connection with these two ballots, the NTEU and UB distributed a considerable amount of information and other material to affected staff members. This material drew attention to differences that existed between the proposed s 170LK agreements and the provisions of the EBA. 9 After the failure of the second ballot, UB commenced offering AWAs to its staff members. The AWAs were, broadly speaking, modelled on the agreements which had been rejected by the ballots. THE ALLEGEDLY MISLEADING STATEMENTS 10 UB commenced offering AWAs to staff members by way of an email sent by the Vice Chancellor of UB to all staff members on 14 December 2005. The email attached a link by means of which a copy of the proposed general staff AWA could be viewed by staff members. 11 On 14 December 2005, shortly after the dispatch of the Vice Chancellor's email, Mr Wesley Walker on behalf of UB sent an email to all staff concerning the AWAs (""the December 2005 email""). Mr Walker was a consultant to UB in relation to workplace relations. He was heavily engaged in the unsuccessful efforts to introduce a new agreement governing staff terms and conditions in the period between 2003 and late 2005. The December 2005 email was headed 'AWA Questions', and provided as follows: ""The University has commenced offering AWAs to staff, as notified in an email earlier today. The NTEU has also started its campaign against AWAs by placing posters around the campus that ask you to consider four questions. Well, I'm happy to answer those questions. Q1. Will you be giving away key employment conditions? A. No you won't. All the important employment conditions including hours of work, span of hours, overtime, shift penalties, HDAs, superannuation, incremental progression, meal breaks, and all leave entitlements remain unchanged in the AWA. Q2. Will an AWA now guarantee you future pay increases? A. Yes it will. Three pay increases are guaranteed. An increase of 4.5%, back-paid to July 2004 is guaranteed for those employees signing AWAs prior to 31 March 2006. An increase of 4.5% in January 2006 is guaranteed. An increase of 4.5% in January 2007 is guaranteed. A fourth increase of 4.5% in January 2008 is contingent as before, but is very likely to be paid in full. Q3. Will you be diminishing your job security? A. No you won't. The AWA has nothing to do with your job security. The AWA is concerned with your terms and conditions of employment, just like the proposed collective enterprise agreement. There is no connection between the AWA and your contract of employment. If you have a continuing appointment now, you will still have your continuing appointment after you sign the AWA. Q4. Will you have the right to return to the collective agreement when the AWA expires? A. Yes you will. After the AWA reaches its expiry date it can be replaced by another AWA with further benefits, or it can roll on in its present form, or you can terminate it and return to the collective agreement that is in place at the time. In addition the question and response below should be of special interest to staff. Q5. What happens if a new enterprise agreement (LK to LJ) is settled next year and has conditions better than those contained in the AWA? The University Council at its meeting on 13 December 2005 passed the following resolution 'That any new HEWRR * Compliant EB Agreement (LK to LJ) be settled with conditions of employment and salary levels that are overall not greater than those specified in the collective AWAs available to general staff and academic staff.' Agreements settled after 31 March 2006 will have the requirement that any payment of back-pay, at the very best, be limited to 1 January 2006. Also an AWA may be varied during its operation if the employee and University agree. I'll be happy to answer any other questions you may have about AWAs, but please be a little patient because of the workload this activity has now generated."" The applicant founds his case of misleading statements on this email. 12 The applicant alleges that the statements which appear under Question 1 and Question 3 are false and misleading, and contravene s 170WG(2). The essence of the complaint is that, in respect of important employment issues, namely redundancy, probationary employment, termination and discipline and dispute settling procedures, there are significant differences between the terms and conditions in the proposed AWA when compared with the prevailing terms and conditions in the EBA. I shall not attempt to detail the material differences between the two sets of terms and conditions. They are helpfully summarised in the applicant's outline of written submissions. It is unnecessary to set out the detailed differences because UB concedes that there are differences and that the differences are not insignificant. 13 The applicant contends that the statement which appears in the December 2005 email under Question 1 is false and misleading because the significant differences that do exist make it clear that staff members will in fact lose 'key employment conditions' under the AWA which they would otherwise be entitled to under the EBA. Further, he contends that the significant differences that exist between the two sets of conditions also make it clear that 'important employment conditions' in the EBA have been changed by the proposed AWA. UB acknowledges that changes have been made, but disputes the proposition that the changes involve the loss of key employment conditions or a change in important employment conditions. 14 In relation to what appears under Question 3, the applicant submits that the December 2005 email conveys to academic and general staff that the terms of the AWAs being offered by UB have no impact or bearing on the security of employment of staff members who sign the AWA. The applicant submits that this representation is false and misleading, as the proposed AWAs will substantially diminish a number of EBA protections for employees in respect of how termination of employment or discipline may be affected. In short, the allegation is that the AWAs will make it easier for UB to terminate or discipline academic and general staff, thereby adversely affecting their security of employment. It is put that provisions in an industrial instrument which go to the method of termination of employment directly concern security of employment: see Re Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia; Ex parte Wooldumpers (Victoria) Limited [1989] HCA 10 ; (1989) 166 CLR 311 at 336 per Gaudron J. 15 Section 170WG(2) is concerned with 'knowingly' false or misleading statements. The applicant submits that this element of the alleged contraventions will be made out because Mr Walker was directly responsible for the negotiation of the EBA, and also had the conduct of the later unsuccessful attempts to introduce a replacement agreement on behalf of UB. As a result, Mr Walker had very detailed knowledge of the terms of the EBA, and the respects in which they differed from the proposed AWAs. In these circumstances, the applicant submits that there is a serious question to be tried that Mr Walker knew all of the essential matters which would go to make up the alleged contravention of s 170WG(2), whether or not Mr Walker perceived that the statements in the December 2005 email were false or misleading: see Yorke v Lucas (1985) 159 CLR 661 at 669 per Gibbs CJ; and King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd (2001) 184 ALR 98 at 104-106. 16 The applicant contends that the December 2005 statements amounted to continuing representations, which may influence staff members who are contemplating the making of an AWA with UB. Without conceding that there was anything false, misleading or inaccurate about the December 2005 statements, UB disputed the ongoing influence of those statements. UB relies upon an affidavit sworn by Mr Walker on 22 February 2006 which points out that a significant amount of additional information has been provided to staff members since 14 December 2005. 17 On 27 January 2006, UB modified the information on its web page concerning the AWAs. In particular, the section headed 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' was amended to include, inter alia , the following statements: ""5. Does the AWA change my employment status? The AWA is concerned with your terms and conditions of employment (just like a collective agreement). Your contract of employment determines whether you are employed on a full-time, part-time, continuing or fixed-term basis. Entering into an AWA does not affect this. So, for example, if your current employment status is as a continuing employee, that status will not change. 6. Will I be giving away key employment conditions if I sign an AWA? Important employment conditions in the current enterprise agreement remain in the general staff AWA. These include hours of work, span of hours, overtime, shift penalties, HDAs, superannuation, incremental progression, meal breaks, all leave entitlements, flexible work arrangements, 48/52 employment, public holidays, annual closedown, broadbanding, make-up pay, and salary packaging. Some of these conditions, for example, overtime, shift penalties and HDAs do not apply for academic staff and have not been included in the academic staff AWA. The current enterprise agreement was drafted 6 years ago and, obviously, provisions in that agreement and the AWAs are not identical. For example: &#8226; the dispute resolution procedure in the AWA is the model procedure prescribed by the Employment Advocate; &#8226; the AWA does not include appeals or review committees that review decisions made in cases of redundancy, unsatisfactory performance, misconduct and academic probation. The AWA does include a process for appeals in the case of termination of employment. If you have a concern about a particular entitlement that is important to you, you should raise that concern with Human Resources, who will explain any difference between the AWA and the enterprise agreement. ... 8. Will I have the right to return to the collective agreement when the AWA expires? After the AWA reaches its nominal expiry date it can be replaced by another AWA, or it can roll on in its present form until it is replaced, or it can be terminated according to the provisions in the AWA and/or the legislation. If you and the University agree, your AWA can be terminated at any time. What happens after an AWA is terminated depends on whether it is a pre-reform AWA , or an AWA made after the amendments to the Workplace Relations Act come into force (expected to be in March 2006). A pre-reform AWA is one that is made before the amended legislation comes into force. If you have a pre-reform AWA and it is terminated at any time, you will revert to the collective agreement that is in place at that time. An AWA that is made after the amended legislation comes into force (ie a post-reform AWA) can be terminated on 90 days notice by you, your bargaining agent (which might be the union), or the University after the AWA reaches its nominal expiry date. Until the terminated AWA is replaced by another AWA or a collective agreement made after the date of termination you will revert to the Fair Pay and Conditions Standards set by the Australian Fair Pay Commission, and to protected award conditions. In addition, the University may give an undertaking as to the terms and conditions of employment that will cover you if the University terminates the AWA after it expires."" 18 The applicant submitted that this information did not correct all of the misstatements in the December 2005 email, and it was simply posted on UB's web page. In contrast, the December 2005 statements were sent by email to all staff members. 19 Mr Walker deposes that information sessions concerning the proposed AWAs were held with academic and general staff in late December 2005 and in January and February 2006. At these sessions, Mr Walker says that he explained the workplace disputes clause and the differences between the procedure put in place by the AWA when compared with the EBA. In addition, Mr Walker deposes that if any staff member was misled by the December 2005 email, then the information sessions conducted by UB and the changes to the 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' web page would have made clear to them that a number of conditions of employment, including those relating to managing under-performance, discipline for misconduct and serious misconduct, redundancy and the resolution of workplace disputes would be altered by the AWA. 20 UB also relied upon an affidavit by Ms Penelope Faith Irish, a manager employed by UB in the area of accommodation services. She deposes that she signed an AWA after attending an information session with Mr Walker. She refers to differences between the EBA and the AWA in the area of redundancy entitlements, redundancy review processes, dispute resolution processes and the process to manage unsatisfactory performance and allegations of misconduct, but considered those issues to be peripheral and not important to her personally compared with other matters covered by the AWA. 21 UB also relies upon the fact that since 14 December 2005, the NTEU has provided extensive information to staff members drawing their attention to differences between the proposed AWAs and the EBA. In his submissions, Dr Jessup QC, senior counsel for UB, recognised that information published by the NTEU may not have the same authority or significance as correcting information that is published by UB. GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTIONS 22 The general principles governing the grant of interlocutory injunctions are well settled. The Court must be satisfied that there is both a serious question to be tried in the principal proceeding, and that the balance of convenience favours of the grant of an injunction: see Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Limited [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618; American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396; Australian Coarse Grain Pool Pty Ltd v Barley Marketing Board of Queensland (1983) 57 ALJR 425; Tableland Peanuts Pty Ltd v The Peanut Marketing Board (1984) 58 ALJR 283; Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1984) 3 FCR 55; and Patrick Stevedores Operations (No 2) Proprietary Limited v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 ("" Patrick Stevedores ""). These two questions are not considered in isolation from each other; the strength or weakness of the claim will have a bearing on what is required by way of balance of convenience: see Bullock v The Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia (No 1) (1985) 5 FCR 464 at 472. 23 The High Court has recently stressed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 ("" ABC "") that an interlocutory injunction is granted in aid of some legal or equitable right to final relief: see Gleeson CJ at 217 [11]-[12] and 218 [16]; Gaudron J at 232 [60]; and Gummow and Hayne JJ at 240-241 [88]-[91] and 248 [105]. Gummow and Hayne JJ said that the basic proposition where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought is that it is necessary to identify the legal (which may be statutory) or equitable rights which are to be determined at trial and in respect of which there is sought final relief which may or may not be injunctive in nature (at 241 [91]). I leave aside for the moment, as the High Court did, cases where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought in some special statutory jurisdiction, and cases where the integrity of the judicial process is protected by forms of relief such as the Mareva order or anti-suit injunctions. 24 The purpose ordinarily served by an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo. The way in which Gleeson CJ put it in ABC was that the justice and convenience of imposing an interim restraint, pending the hearing of the final action, if it exists, lies in the need to prevent the practical destruction of the right that is sought to be vindicated by the proceedings before there has been an opportunity to have its existence finally established (at 217 [12]). This formulation may not be apt in every case, but it draws attention to the fact that there must be an appropriate connection between the form of interim relief that is sought, the danger or damage that is sought to be averted by the interim relief, and the final relief which is claimed in the action. 25 The Court will also consider whether damages are an adequate remedy. This can be undertaken separately from an examination of the balance of convenience: see, for example, Castlemaine Tooheys Limited v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148. But it can also be undertaken as part of the assessment of the balance of convenience, and this is, perhaps, the more common approach. 26 One final and perhaps obvious point that bears repeating is that the Court does not embark on anything resembling a trial of the action when it deals with an application for interlocutory relief. Ordinarily, the Court will not attempt to reach any conclusion as to the facts or matters in dispute, beyond satisfying itself as to whether there is a serious question to be tried, or about other matters that may bear on the balance of convenience or discretionary considerations. SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE TRIED 27 On the material before me, I have concluded that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether the December 2005 email contained statements which were knowingly false or misleading, and which were made to staff members of UB with the intention of persuading them to make an AWA with UB. In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account the significant differences that exist between the EBA and the proposed AWAs, and evidence indicating that Mr Walker has a detailed knowledge of both instruments. 28 This conclusion, however, does not end the inquiry, as UB challenges the applicant's legal entitlement to relief on other grounds. Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant has not established that the interim relief he seeks is properly connected with any final relief to which the applicant has a legal or equitable right. In this context, Dr Jessup relies upon the width of the claims for interlocutory relief. Despite criticism of the terms of relief, the applicant did not seek to narrow the form of the interlocutory injunctions it seeks. As to the first order, Dr Jessup submitted that s 170WG(2) would not support an interim injunction restraining UB from taking any further step to enter into an AWA with a group member. This form of relief, he said, was not directed at restraining the making of, or containing or ameliorating the consequences of, allegedly misleading statements, and would go beyond the relief that could be granted at final trial. Dr Jessup criticised the second order on the grounds that it was expressed in broad and sweeping terms, and no Court would issue a restraining order in terms that UB must refrain from making false or misleading statements to group members. Such an order would do no more than replicate the general terms of s 170WG(2). Dr Jessup criticised the third injunctive order that was sought on the ground that a mandatory order requiring UB to correct the false or misleading statements in the December 2005 email would prejudge the outcome of the case. In my view, there is some force in these criticisms. 29 Next, Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant cannot seek an interim order preventing UB from making an AWA with him in circumstances where the applicant asserts that he has not been misled and will not in any event make an AWA. In Dr Jessup's submission, the applicant is not seeking an interlocutory remedy for himself, but is trying to do so for other members of the group. For those members of the group who have already made an AWA, and for those like the applicant who do not intend to make an AWA, it is difficult to say that the interlocutory relief that is being sought is in aid of final relief. The form of relief that is sought is arguably relevant only to those members of the group who have not yet made an AWA, but who may wish to do so. 30 An applicant in a representative proceeding must himself or herself have standing to sue a particular respondent: see Symington v Hoechst Schering Agrevo Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 164. There is no doubt that the question whether conduct challenged under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) was misleading or deceptive can warrant determination on a representative basis, notwithstanding the fact that inducement might be an element of each individuals cause of action: see King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [2000] FCA 1543 at [13] - [14] . The applicant submitted that a representative action can be brought seeking final declarations and final injunctions in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(2). 31 In Schanka v Employment National (Administration) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 202 ; (2000) 97 FCR 186, the Full Court (comprised of Ryan, Lee and Branson JJ) considered objections to standing in respect of a proceeding that alleged contravention of s 170WG(1) of the WR Act . The proceeding in question was a representative proceeding under Pt IVA of the FCA Act . The Full Court rejected an argument that a penalty could not be imposed under s 170VV in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(1) unless the conduct constituting the duress brought about the making of an AWA. The Full Court said that such a construction should be rejected because it would allow even the most reprehensible conduct engaged in by a party in relation to a proposed AWA to go unexamined by a Court if no concluded agreement were to come into existence. On its proper construction the WR Act supported a wider availability of the remedy afforded by s 170VV. In addressing this issue, the Full Court also considered whether the trial judge, Moore J, had erred in adding an individual, Mr James Burns, as an additional applicant. The alleged error was said to have arisen because Mr Burns had declined the offer of employment and so had never become a party to an AWA. The Full Court construed the reference in s 170VV(3) to 'a party to the AWA or ancillary document' so as to include a party to negotiations. 32 It follows therefore that an action for penalties and injunctive relied under ss 170VV and 170VZ can properly be constituted as a representative action: see Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1999] FCA 1250 ; (1999) 94 FCR 179. I also note that s 33C of the FCA Act provides that a representative proceeding may be commenced whether or not the relief sought is the same for each person represented. And I entirely accept the proposition that nothing in s 170VZ excludes this Court's powers under s 23 of the FCA Act to grant an interim or interlocutory injunction in an appropriate case: see Patrick Stevedores at 29 [27] per Brennan CJ; and Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1760 ; (2000) 104 FCR 80 at 103 [96] . Nonetheless, it may be a different question whether an applicant can bring an application for interlocutory relief in a representative proceeding, where the applicant has no individual entitlement to that relief, but the relief is sought on the basis that it may be relevant and necessary for other members of the group. 33 Dr Jessup's submissions may also raise issues about the identification of the group members. In this case, the application alleges that a common issue of law and fact arises, namely whether the December 2005 statements made on behalf of UB were knowingly false or misleading with the intention of persuading the academic and general staff to make the AWA, within the meaning of s 170WG(2) of the WR Act . In respect of these issues, the group may be composed of three different classes of members: first, those like the applicant, who have not signed the AWA and do not intend to do so; second, those who have not signed the AWA and who may wish to do so; and third those who have signed the AWA. The affected groups or sub-groups may need to be defined more precisely: ss 33Q and 33ZB of the FCA Act . 34 I have not had the benefit of full argument on any of the issues raised by these submissions. I do not propose to express from views about the submissions discussed in [28] to [29] above. In all the circumstances, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the applicant has demonstrated a serious question to be tried as to its entitlement to relief at trial. In view of the matters relied upon by Dr Jessup, however, I consider that the case that has been demonstrated by the applicant at this stage is towards the weaker end of the spectrum. As will appear it is unnecessary for me to be more definitive, as I have reached the conclusion that the application for interim relief should be refused on other grounds. BREACH OF AN IMPLIED TERM OF TRUST AND CONVENIENCE 35 The applicant's outline of written submissions contains an allegation that an implied term of trust and confidence should be implied into each group member's contract of employment with UB: see generally Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 144; Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 116 IR 186 ; and Heptonstall v Gaskin (No 2) (2005) 138 IR 103. The outline further alleges that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached this implied term by recklessly or knowingly making false or misleading statements to its staff members concerning the terms and conditions of employment which would apply to them if they entered into the proposed AWAs. 36 The application by which these proceedings was instituted does not contain any reference to these allegations. Nor is it mentioned in any of the affidavits that were filed by the applicant in support of its application for interlocutory relief. The first notice that UB had of these allegations came when the applicant's counsel handed up the outline of written submissions at the commencement of the interlocutory hearing. In these circumstances, Dr Jessup said that he did not intend to address any submissions to these allegations. 37 I am not satisfied at this stage that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached any such implied contractual term. The basic case that has been put is simply that Mr Walker made statements that were false and misleading in circumstances which gave rise to a contravention of s 170WG(2). 38 In view of the lack of notice of these allegations to the respondent, and the lack of evidence directed to the breach of the alleged implied term, I do not propose to discuss these allegations any further. I note as well that the applicant hardly addressed any submissions to the alleged breach of implied term. BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 39 The grant of an interlocutory injunction is discretionary. In exercising that discretion, the Court will closely examine the balance of convenience. This involves weighing up the extent of any impending prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant if injunctive relief is not granted pending trial, and weighing that against the extent of any hardship that the grant of the injunction may cause the respondent. It also needs to be borne in mind that the purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo, and that the interlocutory injunction is granted so as to preserve or protect the legal or equitable rights that are sought to be vindicated in the proceedings. One relevant inquiry for the Court will be whether irreparable injury which is not compensable in damages will result if relief is not granted. 40 The applicant submits that irreparable harm will occur if injunctive relief is not granted. He submits that the Court is not empowered to revoke an AWA even if it is made in reliance on false or misleading statements made in contravention of s 170WG(2). This is said to follow from the fact that an AWA, once filed, takes on a statutory character. Section 170VM sets out the circumstances when an AWA may be terminated, and the applicant points out that none of them apply to the present circumstances. Further, the applicant submits that the Court is not empowered to make an order for damages in respect of any loss suffered in consequence of a breach of s 170WG(2). UB also submitted that the Court is not empowered to set aside an AWA after it has been filed, and takes on a statutory character. 41 The applicant's case for interlocutory relief was based on the premise that the December 2005 statements were continuing to operate, and might mislead staff members into making an AWA between the time of the hearing and the determination of the proceeding. The interim relief is not relevant to those members of the group who have already made AWAs, or those members of the group who, like the applicant, possess full information and do not intend to make an AWA. 42 In my opinion, the legitimate purpose of an interlocutory injunction at this point, pending trial, is to eliminate or mitigate the risk that staff members of UB might be misled by the December 2005 statements into making an AWA if no relief is granted. 43 The starting point, therefore, is to consider what relief, if any, is just, convenient or necessary at this point to address the risk that the December 2005 statements are continuing to operate and may influence staff members to enter into an AWA with UB. 44 UB has submitted that the continuing influence of the December 2005 statements is likely to be minor, if they have any continuing effect at all. UB submits that the academic community at UB is generally well informed about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWAs. Moreover, UB submits that the December 2005 statements have been overtaken by a substantial amount of subsequent information. While there is some force in these submissions, there must remain a risk that the December 2005 statements may have some ongoing influence on some staff members. 45 UB has submitted that any case which might otherwise have existed for the grant of interim relief is met by UB's preparedness to offer an undertaking to the Court. A form of undertaking was provided to me during the course of the hearing. In essence, the undertaking is to the effect that UB will make a further extensive clarification statement to all staff members identifying the differences between the proposed AWA and the EBA. Further, UB said that it would undertake to refrain from entering into AWAs with its staff members until the expiry of a period of seven days after the publication of the new information to its staff members. By this means, UB submitted that any risk that staff members might enter into an AWA on the basis of misleading or false statements would be removed. 46 At the time of the hearing of the interlocutory application, the applicant and his counsel had not had a full opportunity of considering the terms of the proposed undertakings. I directed that the parties consult with each other about the terms of the proposed undertakings. I further directed that UB submit a final form of the proposed undertakings after a process of consultation had taken place. UB has now submitted a final form of the proposed undertakings. I have been informed that the parties have agreed upon the terms of the clarification statement, but no agreement was reached about other aspects of the proposed undertakings. I shall not set the proposed undertakings in these reasons, as they are recorded in the orders which I propose to make. 47 In my opinion, the undertakings proposed by UB are a complete answer to the application for interim relief. The proposed undertakings remove any real risk that staff members will be induced to enter into AWAs between the date of my order and the date of trial as a result of the allegedly misleading statements that were made in December 2005. 48 In the light of the undertakings proffered by UB, I consider that the hardship that would be occasioned by the grant of wide interlocutory injunctions of the kind sought by the applicant outweighs any prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant and other group members that would be occasioned by withholding relief. The undertakings afford the best means of preserving the status quo pending trial, and address the risk that the December 2005 statements may have a continuing influence on staff members. In short, the undertakings produce an outcome that is both just and convenient. 49 A number of other factors support the conclusion that it is neither just nor convenient to grant the interlocutory relief sought by the applicant. Some of them are discretionary factors. 50 First, the relief sought by the applicant is cast in extremely wide terms and arguably goes beyond relief that could be legitimately sought in this proceeding. 51 Secondly, the relief sought by the applicant would seriously impinge upon the rights of third parties. An injunction restraining UB from entering into an AWA with its staff members pending the trial of this action would seriously affect the rights of those staff members, including their entitlement to back-pay. The applicant submits that the risk that such employees would lose their entitlement to back-pay if AWAs cannot be concluded by 31 March 2006 is an arbitrary limitation that was imposed by UB, and it can be varied at UB's discretion. I will assume that this is so. Nonetheless, it is relevant to the exercise of my discretion that the form of relief that has been sought will significantly affect the rights of other staff members. Their rights will be affected if the injunction were to go, whether or not the employees have fully informed themselves about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWA. Employees may be so affected even if they opt out of the represented group. If there is another alternative that protects staff members from the risk that they will be misled by the December 2005 statements, such as that offered by the undertakings, it is a relevant consideration that the more drastic alternative proposed by the applicant will affect the rights of third parties. 52 The applicant submits that the position of third parties will be protected by its undertaking as to damages. The usual form of undertaking in this Court extends beyond the damages which may be suffered by the respondent consequent upon the interlocutory order, and includes damages that may be suffered by other persons. In this case, the applicant has proffered his own undertaking jointly with an undertaking by the NTEU. I accept that a joint undertaking as to damages by the applicant and the NTEU is one of substance. However, I do not consider that the availability of the undertaking can justify the making of an interim order that will seriously affect third party rights, in circumstances where there is another alternative that is both just and convenient and which will not adversely affect third party rights. 53 In this case, I would not discount the significance of the impact on third party rights in the way that Finkelstein J did in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2000) 106 IR 139 at [57]. CONCLUSION 54 For the foregoing reasons, I propose to dismiss the application for interlocutory relief. I do so upon the basis of the undertakings proffered to the Court by UB.

Obviously breaches of the rule may occur in many different circumstances and it would be quite inappropriate for the courts to endeavour to lay down a specific procedure to remedy the problems flowing from a breach no matter in what circumstances the breach occurs. Different situations will call for different remedies and in my opinion the precise procedures to be adopted when a breach of the rule occurs lies within the discretion of the trial judge. It is for him to determine whether a breach has occurred and, if so, what steps should be taken to ensure that the trial does not miscarry. He may, for example, require the relevant witness to be recalled for further cross-examination before allowing the contradictory evidence to be given or he may decline to allow the party in default to address upon a particular subject upon which the opposing party was not cross-examined: see, eg, Precision Plastics Pty Ltd v Demir [1975] HCA 27 ; (1975) 132 CLR 362.

At [65] , Gummow and Hayne JJ applied Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 622-3 where it was observed that the two main enquiries are as follows: 'The first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief...The second inquiry is...whether the inconvenience or injury which the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted.' 10 GenRx must show sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial. This depends on the nature of the rights and the practical consequences likely to flow from the orders sought ( O'Neill at [65] [72] per Gummow and Hayne JJ). It is in this context that the formulation ""serious question to be tried"" has effect when the Court asks whether an applicant has shown that there is a serious question to be tried as to the applicant's entitlement to relief, that the applicant is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy and has shown that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction ( O'Neill at [19] per Gleeson CJ and Crennan J). In considering the balance of convenience, the Court may take into account whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if the injunction is granted to a party who fails to establish its right at trial or in failing to grant an injunction to a party who succeeds at trial ( Bradto Pty Ltd v State of Victoria [2006] V ConvR 54-722 at [35]). 18 I accept that there is a serious question in the O'Neill sense. 19 There is little evidence on the number of advertisements presently ""in the pipeline"" or the difficulties faced by Servier if it were ordered not to place further advertisements asserting improved stability. I conclude that no serious inconvenience or injustice would be suffered if no further advertisements referring to stability were to be placed until further order. 20 It is therefore appropriate that Servier be prohibited from placing any further advertisements containing the reference to ""improved stability"" until further order."

To adapt the language used by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare , a legal choice must be made about possible concepts conveyed by the statutory expression, and in making that choice it is appropriate to take account of the intent and purpose of the Customs Tariff Act . In my opinion, it would have been permissible for the Tribunal to have regard to the Harmonised System Notes as an extrinsic aid to the interpretation of heading 3808. Where the language of a heading is ambiguous or susceptible to different interpretations, the Harmonised System Notes are an appropriate extrinsic aid to interpretation: Gardner Smith v Collector of Customs Victoria (1986) 66 ALR 377 at 383-384; Barry R Liggins Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs (1991) 103 ALR 565 at 571-573; and Toyota Tsusho Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs [1992] FCA 282 at [22] - [30] ."

The notice of appeal raised a purported natural justice issue based on actual bias or apprehension of bias. Nicholls FM cited a number authorities of the Federal Court and the High Court upon that subject, and concluded on that issue adversely to the appellants, as follows: can see no basis for review of the Tribunal's decision on the basis of actual or apprehended bias. The [appellants] have brought no evidence whatsoever to ground a complaint that the Tribunal did not bring an open mind to the assessment of the claims. It is rarely the case that bias can be made out with reference to the decision record alone, and no further evidence has been provided by the applicant in this respect... .' In that context his Honour made reference to VFAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 872 ; (2003) 131 FCR 102 as an exemplification of those principles, where Kenny J found that a case of apprehended bias had been established adversely to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, but which authority was said to exemplify the difficulty of establishing bias. I am unable to discern any viable footing for the appellants' case on bias, or reasonable apprehension of bias, to the extent that the same was ultimately pursued (if at all) on the present appeal, which was not entirely clear. As his Honour emphasised in any event, the doctrine of actual bias in the form of prejudgment seemingly invoked by the appellants required evidence of any such prejudgment by the decision-maker, to the extent that he or she is alleged to have been ' so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration, whatever evidence or argument may be presented', his Honour citing thereby Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [72] (Gleeson CJ and Gummow J).

They also say that if the action in rem remains on foot the owner will incur legal costs that will be passed on to the company in administration. I think there is little substance in the first point. If the vessel is arrested the owner will put up security and obtain its release. That will happen quickly, as it always does with a vessel that can easily be demised. There is some substance to the second point. I accept the owner will incur some costs in sorting out the quantum of ASP's claim and a portion of the costs will be payable by Pan Australia, leaving less for the other unsecured creditors. But the costs will not be excessive, in my opinion. Anyway, I am of opinion that the interests of the general body of unsecured creditors should be subordinated to those of ASP whose claim over the vessel is proprietary in nature.

Case7848,applied,Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd (ACN 004 061 214) v Aconex Pty Ltd (ACN 091 376 091) (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010,"far as the interests of justice are concerned, there is another consideration which is relevant in the context of this particular litigation. It was articulated by Goldberg J in Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd (ACN 004 061 214) v Aconex Pty Ltd (ACN 091 376 091) (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010 at para 48 in these terms: The interests of justice require that commercial litigation of the type in this proceeding should be conducted expeditiously and that parties should only be able, after judgment has been reserved, to re-visit tactical decisions they have made in exceptional circumstances where injustice might otherwise result. No such exceptional circumstances exist in the present case. There needs to be a finality to the process of litigation and a limit on the number of times a party can re-visit issues which have arisen in the course of a trial and have been addressed. Unsurprisingly, Termicide points to this passage as supporting an exercise of discretion so as to refuse to permit Granitgard to reopen its case. There is no doubt that this particular proceeding is aptly described as ""commercial litigation"". It is a suit between competitors in a marketplace. It has been both at its interlocutory stages, and in the course of the trial to date, very closely contested indeed. There is no doubt that there are particular commercial interests at stake in terms of the interests in deriving profit from the conduct of business as between Granitgard and Termicide. Mr Gabriel's evidence as foreshadowed is not evidence which it could be described as available with the exercise of due diligence to Granitgard at any stage prior to the closing of its case or, for that matter, the closing of Termicide's case. One way of describing Granitgard's access to Mr Gabriel is that it is the product of what one might term a whistle blower, an anonymous whistle blower. Whether or not that whistle is nothing more than idle puffery, or perhaps a venting of spleen on the part of the disgruntled, is something that does not arise for consideration on the present application, otherwise than as a contingency which would fall for assessment, so far as Mr Gabriel's credibility is concerned, in the event that leave is granted to reopen Granitgard's case so as to permit him to be called."

Case21080,referred to,Federal Coke Company v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 15 ALR 449,"At times, the submissions put on behalf of SGB appeared to combine the undoubtedly correct (at least at a sufficient level of generality) propositions that the contractual and legal rights must be analysed and that the separateness of corporate entities must be recognised: The Federal Coke Company v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 15 ALR 449 at 459 per Bowen CJ and Commissioner of Taxation v Asiamet (No 1) Resources Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 73 ; (2004) 137 FCR 146 at [148] - [165] , in aid of a different objective, that is to have the interest payable under the Debenture analysed by reference primarily, if not wholly, to the rights and obligations created under the Indenture, without regard to the whole of the surrounding arrangement. Such an approach is impermissible. It ignores the essential requirement to view the legal rights and obligations created by the parties, and payments and outgoings made thereunder, in their whole legal and commercial context, in order that the characterisation, from a business and practical point of view, of the payment or outgoing by reference to the relevant legal relationship can be undertaken. Legal form is the subject of the characterisation; it is not the sole source of the answer to that process of characterisation: cf Parsons RW op cit [2.421]-[2.422]. The requirement to look at the whole legal and business context is not denied by what was said by Deane and Sheppard JJ in Ure v Federal Commission of Taxation (1981) 34 ALR 237 at 249, as appeared to be put by SGB."
Case20618,applied,Murrumbidgee Groundwater Preservation Association Inc v Minster for Natural Resources [2005] NSWCA 10,"case not dissimilar in principle to the present was Murrumbidgee Groundwater Preservation Association Inc v Minister for Natural Resources [2005] NSWCA 10. In that case, the Minister had made a Water Sharing Plan for the Lower Murrumbidgee Groundwater Sources 2003, which was a legislative instrument under the Water Management Act 2000 (NSW). The appellant, who was an association of primary producers, unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the Plan in the Land and Environment Court and appealed to the Court of Appeal on a number of grounds, including one based on irrationality. Spigelman CJ (with whom Beazley and Tobias JJA agreed) said, at [111]: The Appellant's case on irrationality has its factual foundation in the limited interconnectivity within the aquifers the subject of the Plan. Although it is accepted that each aquifer is a single geological formation, it is submitted that the absence of interconnectivity is such that it is not rational to treat this formation as a single body of water for the purposes of a plan under the Act. At [121], his Honour summarised the contentions by the appellant: [Under this plan] the transferor will receive a windfall by obtaining consideration for an asset, being the entitlement which they may never have used and which in the future could not use. The transfer of entitlements provides no environmental benefit, it could never have been utilised, but the holder of the licence receives financial consideration (which may be quite substantial) from the transferee who can utilise the licence. Continuing: The effect is that the transferee suffers a financial detriment which is to the benefit of the transferor. In these circumstances, although there may be windfall gains and losses, there is no net benefit for the acquifer or the environment. ... ... the absurdity of the Plan is emphasised by the fact that many of those who will acquire water will have expended considerable sums in developing their properties, in some cases with the active encouragement of the government, only to now pay money for water rights without which part of their capital investment in infrastructure may be lost. ... ... the applicants submit that the consequences of the Plan is to give a windfall to some and inflict financial hardship on others. And at [122]: ... the limited degree of interconnectivity which is accepted by all experts leads to a level of unfairness that indicates irrationality or illogicality. Where there is a challenge to the exercise of a statutory power on the basis of irrationality or unreasonableness, Spigelman CJ said, at [129]: ... Perhaps the most appropriate formulation is whether the decision is ""illogical, irrational or lacking a basis in findings or inferences of fact supported on logical grounds"": Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex Parte Applicant S 20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at [52] and [37], [173] ...."
Case8981,affirmed,MZYAV v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1728,"appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, given on 15 December 2008 and published as MZYAV v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1728. The learned federal magistrate dismissed an application seeking review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal""), the second respondent to the appeal. The Tribunal dismissed an application for review of a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (""the Minister""), the first respondent to the appeal, refusing to grant to the appellant a protection visa. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka. He arrived in Australia on 23 September 2007. On 2 November 2007 he applied for a protection visa. The decision of the Minister's delegate was given on 14 January 2008. The appellant then applied to the Tribunal for review of the decision of the Minister's delegate. On 18 March 2008, the Tribunal conducted a hearing at which the appellant attended and was represented by a migration agent. The Tribunal's decision was signed on 7 May 2008 and handed down or sent to the appellant on 21 May 2008. The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court on 6 June 2008. He filed an amended application on 21 July 2008. His application was listed for hearing on 13 November 2008 but was adjourned until 15 December 2008 to enable the appellant to consider his case and seek legal advice. He appeared without representation at the hearing on 15 December 2008. The federal magistrate dismissed the appellant's application and ordered that he pay the Minister's costs, fixed at $5,000. By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (""the Migration Act ""), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms ""Refugees Convention"" and ""Refugees Protocol"" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 . It is convenient to call these two documents, taken together, the ""Convention"". For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who: owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country"
Case17246,referred to,Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550,"The extent to which the rules of natural justice apply to decisions of the Committee under s 52D(2) is controlled by the relevant provisions of the Act and Regulations ( Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 per Mason J at 577, Wilson J at 594, Brennan J at 609 and Deane J at 633). 138 As outlined above (see [19]-[20]) the Regulations require advance public notice to be given of a meeting of the Committee at which a decision is to be made concerning the scheduling of a substance. They do not require advance notice to be given of a decision to foreshadow consideration of the scheduling of a substance. The Regulations establish a regime for the receipt and consultation of public submissions both before and following a scheduling decision. A sponsor who seeks a scheduling decision concerning a substance will, it may be assumed, make a submission in support of the scheduling decision sought by it. Certainly Roche did in respect of the scheduling of orlistat. A scheduling decision does not come into effect until after the Committee has had the opportunity to consider the further submissions, if any, made in response to its decision by those who made submissions concerning the scheduling decision. A record of the Committee's reasons for the decision are to be publicly accessible. 139 In my view the statutory provisions which govern the exercise of the Committee's power under s 52D(2) of the Act do not disclose an intention that the exercise of that power is conditioned on sponsors of substances being given rights to be heard additional to the rights to make the submissions for which the Regulations provide."
Case8201,applied,CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384,"Mr Wooding was awarded a certificate from the United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam in respect of each of his two visits there, attesting to his contribution to the morale and welfare of the military forces in Vietnam (T48/49) [sic].' 4 Further facts were subsequently agreed of which I need refer to only one. It was: ""1. Mr Wooding was issued with General Briefing Orders upon his arrival in Vietnam for the second Concert Party. A copy of those orders is attached as Annexure E."" The annexure was entitled ""Adelaide Concert Party 17 Feb 10 Mar 70"" and was prepared by a military officer. It dealt with such matters as travel arrangements, performances, accommodation and allowances (seemingly paid by the Commonwealth), identification (""You will be supplied with a Military Identity Card by your escort officer""), clothing, security etc. 5 Of the material referred to in, or annexed to, the Statement of Agreed Facts, I need only mention the following. In para 9 the references to the Concert Parties being ""arranged"" and ""sponsored"" by AFOF are references to newspaper articles where these terms happen to be used. In particular where the word ""sponsored"" is used it would seem that the journalist who wrote the piece was referring to the fact (also reflected in para 9) that the Concert Party came from South Australia and their trip had been funded by public donation. In Annexure B (referred to in that same paragraph) a member of the Committee of AFOF, SA Division, acknowledged ""the great help we have received in arranging the Concert Party to tour Vietnam"". 6 As to the history and background referred to in para 12, it is only necessary to refer to the following part of the letter of Major General W J Crews of 24 April 2006: ""The RSL Australian Forces Overseas Fund is an approved and accredited philanthropic organisation to operate within the Australian Defence Force. The RSL began providing Christmas parcels to members of the Australian Army serving in Vietnam in 1963. This early RSL fund was amalgamated with the (Sydney) Lord Mayor's Comfort Fund, and hence the Australian Forces Overseas Fund (AFOF) was officially established on 26 January 1966. It was tasked with coordinating a program for the provision of amenities and concert parties for troops serving in the South East Asia Region, and while initially established in NSW, it soon became a National organisation on the establishment of the RSL National Council. In those earliest years, each RSL State Branch appears to have a similarly worded AFOF Constitution (NSW dated Feb 1966 and 28 May 1968, TAS dated 18 June 1968, WA dated 28 Feb 1968), with no specific mention of FACE, except that the Objects state that 'The objects shall be the provision of comforts, equipment and entertainment for Australian Servicemen and women serving overseas or in such other areas as may be determined from time to time'. To assist in the management and coordination of the concert parties, the Minister of Defence has established The Forces Advisory Committee on Entertainment (FACE) in 1966 as a joint venture involving Defence, the RSL and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. FACE was to act as a planning Committee to organise entertainment for Australian forces in Vietnam, thus removing any direct Ministerial involvement with the music industry. It is known from our records that the Concert Parties were originally arranged by the RSL State Branches in rotation, under the guidance of the entertainment managers from within the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). It is of interest that the RSL National Headquarters holds a brief signed by Major General D B Dunstan, Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, dated 23 November 1971, titled 'Canteens and Amenities in Vietnam'. This sets out arrangements for all canteen matters and the provision of amenities. It notes that the provision of amenities were financed from four sources as follows: a. ASCO Rebate to Vietnam Command Amenities Fund (VCAF) all movable amenities; tennis courts at Vung Tau; swimming pool at Phan Rang; part of cost of concert parties from Australia. b. Australian Forces Overseas Fund (AFOF) Part of cost of concert parties; two recreation huts at Nui Dat; AATV Club, Danang. c. RSL (Sportsmen's Appeal) Harold Holt Pool, Vung Tau; most of cost of Kevin Wheatley Stadium, Vung Tau. d. Public Funds Peter Badcoe Club, Vung Tau (contained billiard and reading rooms as amenities but otherwise housed ASCO facilities and living quarters for OC Amenities Unit); Pearson Centre, Nui Dat (contained Amenities store and tape centre but otherwise housed ASCO facilities, education centre and film Library); part of cost of concert parties from Australia. Noting the above, it is quite clear that the earliest concert parties were arranged for or on behalf of AFOF, and that they were managed either directly by FACE or another agency on its behalf. It is also clear that the parties were an official part of the Army's philanthropic program. Unfortunately, the records held in the RSL National headquarters do not provide any listings of which entertainers were accredited to each concert party and we may need to rely on State Branch records for this."" 7 The second letter referred to in para 12 warrants reference if only because it may have been the source of some confusion in this matter. ""As you are aware, Entertainers in Vietnam who were accredited members of Australian Forces Overseas Fund (AFOF) are considered to be members of a philanthropic organisation and are covered by the instrument signed by the Honourable Ben Humphries, Minister of State for Veterans' Affairs and are eligible for Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA) coverage. These personnel completed the accreditation process administered by the Army. As part of this process, they were allocated a service number, have a service record and were issued with approved identification cards. These people were permanent representatives accredited to accompany an Australian Defence Force (ADF) sponsor unit on a full time basis. Unaccredited entertainers may have been in Vietnam at the behest of the Defence Forces and may have had assisted with logistical support for Entertainers in Vietnam (Travel, etc). However, following a review by the Department of Defence, they confirmed that they were not 'attached' to the Forces and were not under the command of the ADF. Accordingly, these entertainers do not have VEA coverage. A number of these entertainers state that the tours were financed by the AFOF and state that their pay was handed to them by the Army acting as AFOF agents. However, this is does not prove that they were employees of the Army. Many of these entertainers have Certificates of Appreciation issued by AFOF. However, this does not indicate that they were members of an approved philanthropic organisation. As we have previously advised you if Mr Wooding or Mr Milburn-Lloyd are able to provide evidence that they completed the AFOF accreditation process, such as being allocated a service number or service record, or were issued with an approved identification card, then they may have a case for being considered an accredited member of a philanthropic organisation."" THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 8 It is sufficient for present purposes if I set out in full the following paragraphs of the Tribunal's reasons: ""8. I was referred to a decision of Edmonds J in Iversen v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 942. This decision answered an appeal from a decision of Senior Member Kelly in Re Iversen &amp; Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 280. In her decision Senior Member Kelly rejected an argument to the effect that Mr Iversen (who also provided entertainment for troops serving in Vietnam under similar circumstances to Mr Wooding) should be treated as a full-time member of the Defence Force serving in an operational area. 9. Senior Member Kelly noted that Mr Iversen rendered courageous and valuable service in performing for the troops in Vietnam; his service was recognised through a listing in the nominal roll of Vietnam veterans and through the awarding of a Logistics Support Medal; he was a member of a group of civilian entertainers who were, in part sponsored by the AFOF and that the AFOF is an approved philanthropic organisation. She nevertheless decided that Mr Iverson was not a representative of AFOF and consequently was not covered by the Ministerial Determination. 10. On appeal Justice Edmonds rejected a submission that Mr Iversen had been a representative of AFOF: '15. The applicant, in his written submissions, contended that ""representatives"" as it appears in the Determination should be given a meaning that protects those who were in fact in a war zone and thereby exposed to the risks and circumstances associated with that war. It was submitted that such ""factual"" emphasis on the meaning of representative would accord with the beneficial nature of the Act and the Determination made under it. But such a construction goes well beyond the natural and ordinary meaning of the word ""representative"" as exemplified in the dictionary meanings of the word upon which the applicant himself relies. 16. In his oral submissions, the applicant articulated what is substantively, albeit not in the same terms, a similar argument, namely that if the applicant's presence in the war zone is only explicable by reference to his participation in a concert tour co-sponsored by the AFOF and the Australian Army, then he can be a representative of the former. That might be so, but such co-sponsorship will not of itself make the applicant a representative of the co-sponsor. Indeed, as the respondent submits, even if the applicant had been an ""AFOF sponsored"" entertainer rather than an ""Army sponsored"" entertainer, being sponsored by an organisation cannot be equated with being a representative of that organisation.' 11. I have carefully considered the statement of agreed facts. I have also considered a VRB decision of Milburn-Lloyd dated 30 August 2006. I have reached the view that the only way Mr Wooding could be entitled to benefits under the VE Act would be if his service in Vietnam could be considered to have been performed 'as a representative' of the AFOF. 12. Point 9 of the statement of agreed facts indicates that the concert parties were 'arranged and sponsored' by the AFOF. However, as mentioned by Justice Edmond in Iversen , such sponsorship 'cannot be equated with being a representative of that organisation'. In my view, the term 'representative' connotes an entitlement to act on behalf of another. Point 14 of the statement of agreed facts indicates that Mr Wooding does not recall being a 'member of AFOF'. On the information before me, I have not been satisfied that Mr Wooding was a representative of that organisation. In these circumstances, Mr Wooding does not fall within the ambit of the 1987 Ministerial Direction. I have not been satisfied that Mr Wooding's service, although courageous and valuable, satisfies the basic eligibility conditions for payment of a Disability Pension under the VE Act. The decision under review is affirmed."" THE APPLICATION 9 There was, for some time, controversy between the parties as to whether a question of law, as opposed to a mixed question of law and fact was raised in this application: cf s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth); Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council [2001] HCA 12 ; (2001) 202 CLR 439. As I now understand it, the parties have agreed the question of law and that is whether or not it was open to the Tribunal to adopt a constrained interpretation of the word ""representative"" given the context of its use in the Ministerial Determination. 10 To put the applicant's submission shortly, it is that, having regard to the context and purpose of the Determination, the word ""representative"" comprehends a person who provides the relevant service under the aegis of, as an emissary of, or in association with, one of the defined philanthropic organisations. Iversen v Repatriation Commission (2006) 91 ALD 114, it is said, is distinguishable on its facts. 11 The respondent's case is that the view taken by the Tribunal, that ""representative"" connotes an entitlement to act on behalf of another, was one that was open to it. It could not be an error of law for it to have taken that view. Iversen , it is said, is presently relevant and highly persuasive. The respondent also emphasised the limitations of the Statement of Agreed Facts. There was simply no evidence on some number of matters. 12 There was some controversy as well as to whether it could properly be said that the Tribunal actually made findings of fact at all. I am satisfied that on a fair reading of the member's reasons, the agreed facts were the facts found. CONSIDERATION 13 The starting point is, necessarily, with the principles of statutory interpretation. Of these, it was observed in the joint judgment in CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408: ""It is well settled that at common law, apart from any reliance upon s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), the court may have regard to reports of law reform bodies to ascertain the mischief which a statute is intended to cure. Moreover, the modern approach to statutory interpretation (a) insists that the context be considered in the first instance, not merely at some later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise, and (b) uses 'context' in its widest sense to include such things as the existing state of the law and the mischief which, by legitimate means such as those just mentioned, one may discern the statute was intended to remedy. Instances of general words in a statute being so constrained by their context are numerous. In particular, as McHugh JA pointed in Isherwood v Butler Pollnow Pty Ltd , if the apparently plain words of a provision are read in the light of the mischief which the statute was designed to overcome and of the objects of the legislation, they may wear a very different appearance. Further, inconvenience or improbability of result may assist the court in preferring to the literal meaning an alternative construction which, by the steps identified above, is reasonably open and more closely conforms to the legislative intent "": emphasis added. 14 The clear object of the Ministerial Determination was to extend to designated classes of person who were not members of the Defence Force the same entitlements they would have had as an actual member of the Force who was rendering continuous full-time service, for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlement Act, provided (for present purposes) three requirements were met. These were (i) the person provided welfare services to the Defence Force; (ii) in a prescribed operational area (here Vietnam); and (iii) as a representative of any one of six ""approved philanthropic organisation[s]"". Those organisations were: (a) the Australian Red Cross Society; (b) the campaigners for Christ Everyman's Welfare Service; (c) the Salvation Army; (d) the Young Women's Christian Association of Australia; and (e) the Young Men's Christian Association of Australia; and (f) the Australian Forces Overseas Fund. 15 While all of these conditions are required to be satisfied, it is, in my view, relatively clear that the first and second of them differ in their significance and burden from the third. They provide the reason why, as a matter of policy, a person who has satisfied those conditions should be considered as having a possibly legitimate claim to be put on the same footing as members of the Defence Force rendering continuous full-time service, for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlement Act. 16 The third condition (in the ""as representative"" requirement) would appear to be a channelling or control device regulating who actually will be equated with a member of the Defence Force. The relevant organisation is required to be ""approved"" and the presupposition is that in some manner it provides or procures the provision of welfare services to the Defence Force. The question posed by the condition is what is the nature of the connection that must exist between the actual service provider and the approved organisation before the service provider will have his or her service recognised for the purpose of the Act. 17 While the third condition controls access to the benefits of the Act, there is nothing in the beneficial policy, that appears to animate the Ministerial Determination, which would warrant a restrictive interpretation of the required connection. For reasons I give below, I consider that both the Veterans Review Board and the Tribunal have given the Determination such an interpretation, in their respective imposition of an ""agency"" like role on the service provider. This is best illustrated in observations of the Board in reaching its decision. 18 Having referred to a particular dictionary definition the Board said (at [15]): ""In this dictionary definition there appears to the Board to be a concept of a person having authority to act 'for' or 'on behalf of' another involving the notion of agency. The evidence before the Board is that the SACP [South Australia Concert Party] tours of Vietnam were organised, funded and sponsored by the AFOF. This included obtaining the unpaid services of Mr Wooding and others as entertainers. Although the SACP travelled and operated under the AFOF banner, there is no evidence of direct authority or any inferential manifestation of consent by the AFOF that Mr Wooding or any other member of the SACP should act on behalf of the Fund."" 19 In my view so to treat the representational requirement is to subvert what appears to be the purpose of the Determination itself. That purpose, in my view, is to provide potential benefits to persons who relevantly provide welfare services provided those services are provided or procured by one of the approved organisations. 20 Given that the object of the Determination is to identify the classes of persons who will benefit from the Determination, it is understandable that, in form, its focus is on the relationship of the relevant person to the approved philanthropic organisation (i.e. ""who, as representatives of ...""). This said, the apparent policy and purpose of the Determination is manifest in the relationship of the philanthropic organisation to the person providing the service and, especially, to its role in the provision of that service."
Case23480,cited,J Aron Corp v Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 996,"There is, however, the possibility of disconformity between the Registrar's order and O 27 r 4A. Costs assessed on a ""solicitor and client"" basis may be different from the costs recoverable under the rule which provides that the subpoenaed person is to be paid his ""expense or loss reasonably incurred"". The kinds of expenses that are regarded as reasonable for the purposes of the rule can be seen from cases such as: Fuelxpress Ltd v L M Ericsson Pty Ltd (1987) 75 ALR 284; Deposit and Investment Co Ltd (Receivers Appointed) v Peat Marwick Mitchell and Co (unreported, Supreme Court New South Wales, Bainton J, 8 March 1996); Pyramid Building Society (in liq) v Farrow Finance Corporation (in liq) [1995] 1 VR 464; Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Actus Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASC 244 ; Foyster v Foyster Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) [2003] NSWSC 881 ; J Aron Corp v Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 996. These cases establish that if particular costs are reasonably incurred and the quantum is reasonable the costs are recoverable. Whether or not there is an inconsistency between the order and the rule depends upon what is comprehended by a ""solicitor and client"" costs order."

Case12125,cited,Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd (1989) 167 CLR 177,"Thus, it is necessary to plead material facts which establish that the participants to the contract, arrangement or understanding embodying the s 45A provision are engaged in the supply or acquisition of the identified services in any market in Australia and secondly, that the participants are engaged in rivalry with each other in that market in those services. Rivalry however takes place within a field of transactions between buyers and sellers and the boundaries of the field of rivalry are to be determined by not only the services supplied or acquired by a participant to the contract, arrangement or understanding but also having regard to services that are substitutable for or otherwise competitive with those services (s 4E of the Act ). Section 4E of the Act simply recognises the economic orthodoxy of close competition determined by strong substitution (over the long run two years not simply transient demand or supply responses, given a sufficient price incentive) within a field of actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers, as the determinant of the boundaries of a market.

Case24715,applied,A ustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fox Symes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1071,"This is not a case where parts of the pleadings could simply be struck out and the action remain on foot. As Lander J observed in A ustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fox Symes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1071: 'If a Statement of Claim is shown to disclose no reasonable cause of action, then it will be appropriate, rather than to strike out individual paragraphs of the Statement of Claim, to strike out the whole of the Statement of Claim.' (at [107]) 139 Although ordinarily a party should be given an opportunity to replead in accordance with the rules ( Turner v The Bulletin Newspaper Co Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 25 ; (1974) 131 CLR 69 per Barwick CJ (Mason J agreeing) at 81; cf Fox Symes at [95]) in my view it would be unjust to the respondents to allow the applicant yet another opportunity to re-plead. In particular I note: &#8226; Greenwood J had earlier dismissed an application by the applicant for interlocutory relief in this matter on the basis that, inter alia , the applicant lacked standing to bring the application, but noted that it was possible that the applicant could formulate a statement of claim involving rights which had not vested in the trustee in bankruptcy ( Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 at [48] ) &#8226; on 15 June 2006 the applicant filed a Statement of Claim &#8226; on 19 June 2006 the applicant filed an Amended Statement of Claim, although this amended statement of claim was not provided to the respondents until 29 June 2006 when the parties appeared in Court &#8226; when this matter came before me for the notice of motion to be heard on 29 June 2006, it became apparent that the applicant would in fact need to file a further amended statement of claim. I ordered that the applicant be given 21 days in which to file a further amended statement of claim &#8226; the applicant did so in compliance with this order, but then also filed a second further amended statement of claim 10 days later. 140 As Mason CJ and Brennan and Toohey JJ observed in Munnings v Australian Government Solicitor [1994] HCA 12 ; (1994) 120 ALR 586 at 589: '... Although a plaintiff is often granted leave to replead if a statement of claim is struck out, there are some cases where the plaintiff so misconceives the cause of action that the action ought to be brought to an end.' (cf Fox Symes at [109])."
Case8022,referred to,Turner v Trevorrow (1994) 49 FCR 566,"In Turner v Trevorrow (1994) 49 FCR 566 at 575 the Full Federal Court acknowledged the possibility that notwithstanding a long physical absence, a continuing link to Australia could establish that a debtor was ordinarily resident in Australia. The Court's statement of the factors that negatived a conclusion that, on the date in question, Mr Turner was ordinarily resident in Australia, is a clear indication of the factors that the Court considered relevant: 'He did not have a dwelling in Australia. He had left Australia with his family, with the intention of spending a substantial period of time - as much as five years - overseas. He was not engaged in employment which by its very nature created a link between himself and Australia notwithstanding long physical absence - such as employment by the Australian Government or an Australian company. He had, for the time being at least, severed his ties with Australia and made arrangements for the winding down (if not winding up) of the company's business affairs.' 12 Accordingly, the question for the Court in these proceedings is whether, as a matter of fact and degree, the respondent could be said to be ordinarily resident in Australia at the time when the act of bankruptcy was committed on 6 June 2005. The applicants accept that they bear the onus of establishing that, as at 6 June 2005, the respondent was ordinarily resident in Australia within the meaning of s 43(1)(b)(i) of Bankruptcy Act . 13 It is not in contention that the respondent was born in Sydney in 1962 and practised as an accountant and as a registered liquidator between 1991 and 1997. From 1998 to 2003 the respondent lived with his mother, Mrs Ailsa Lee, at Ethersey House, Sutton Forest in New South Wales. Ethersey House was purchased by Cape Vale Pty Limited, a company owned by the respondent's mother and Mr Rudi Fabian in June 1998. It was apparently sold in April 2006. In April 2004 the respondent left Australia for Scotland. The respondent purchased the lease of Dunfallandy House in Scotland in about 2004. He is no longer in possession of Dunfallandy House, apparently because the landlord claims that he has failed to pay the rent. Despite that, he persists in describing it as his 'principal residence' . The respondent presently lives in London with his partner who, he says, supports him. Mrs Lee gave evidence that he had returned on several occasions to visit her; that each visit had lasted only 3 or 4 days; and that the respondent did not have any clothes or personal belongings left in Australia. She further deposed that the respondent did not have a rental agreement with her or Cape Vale Pty Limited."
Case2707,cited,De Garis v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd (1990) 37 FCR 99,"There was a separate and distinct argument that the provision by Fox Sports News to third parties, Hutchison and Vodafone, precludes a fair dealing defence. This was based on the news clippings case, De Garis v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd (1990) 37 FCR 99. The applicant, in this connection said that the respondents were simply broking or selling content, not delivering news. That point may be made good on a final hearing; at this point, I am not persuaded that that conduct - that is, the on-passing of the Fox Sports News to the third parties - is not a fair dealing associated with the reporting of news by Vodafone and Hutchison for the purposes of s 103B(1)(b). 52 I turn to the balance of convenience. I am prepared to accept that if I am not to grant interlocutory relief, and if the respondents have overstepped the mark on fair dealing, real and substantial impairment will occur to the applicant's rights. Some evidence was given in a form which I did not find satisfactory and which I rejected. However, I am prepared to approach the application on the basis that the respondents exceeding their entitlement under s 103B would cause a real impairment of valuable commercial rights to the applicant. Whether this is in any way permanent or otherwise irreparable may perhaps be doubted. If there has been infringement, the profit derived by the respondents from Hutchison and Vodafone would be readily able to be ascertained. Any difficulty in that ascertainment would almost certainly work against the respondents rather than in their favour in accordance with well-understood principle. And as to the use by the respondents themselves on the Foxsports website, a putative licence fee could, no doubt, be calculated. 53 On the other hand, if I grant an injunction and if it turns out that the applicant fails, whilst there would be an undertaking as to damages the interference with the businesses, not only of the respondents but also Hutchison and Vodafone, would be extremely difficult to quantify. The respondents, Hutchison and Vodafone, would not have the ability to call upon the kind of account of profits that the applicant would if the reverse were the case. Further, the nature of the status quo ante favours, in my view, withholding any relief. The evidence reflects that the footage of NRL matches on internet and mobile phones in 2007 is at least comparable to that which occurred in 2006."
Case14562,applied,Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461,"The parties were not in dispute as to the principles that apply to the construction of the 981 Patent. I was referred to numerous authorities in which these principles have been clearly articulated, including Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 ( 'Welch Perrin' ) at 610; Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 ( 'Interlego' ) at 478 (see also Stephen J at first instance at 466); D&eacute;cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 at 400; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 22 IPR 1 at 18-19; Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 230 at 236 [39], 238 [52] and 245-246 [91]-[94]; Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Ely Lilly &amp; Co (2005) 68 IPR 1 ( 'Pfizer' ) at 52-54 [247]-[250]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 ( 'Kirin-Amgen' ) at 452-457 [27]-[35]; PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2005) 216 ALR 41 ( 'PhotoCure' ) at 85 [172] and 85-86 [168]-[174]; Sachtler GmbH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 373 ( 'Sachtler' ) at 380-382 [39]-[42]; Clorox Australia Pty Ltd v International Consolidated Business Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 254 ( 'Clorox' ) at 260-262 [13]-[22]. 64 For present purposes, however, it is helpful to refer specifically to several principles that have particular resonance with the circumstances of this case: (1) The underlying consideration in the construction of the patent is that it is a public instrument, conferring a public monopoly, that is meant to define the monopoly in such a way that it is not capable of being misunderstood: see eg Pfizer at 52 [247]. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and to allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct that is prohibited: see eg Clorox at 261 [18]. (2) The claims define the invention which is the subject of the patent. They must be construed according to their terms by applying the ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument: see eg D&eacute;cor at 400; Clorox at 260 [15]. (3) The claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole. The rest of the specification may explain the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of technical terms, or aid in resolving ambiguities in the construction of the claims: Clorox at 260 [16]; Sachtler at 381 [42]. (4) Although the claims are to be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, 'the settled rule is that it is not permissible to vary or qualify the plain or unambiguous meaning of the claim by reference to the body of the specification': see Interlego per Barwick CJ and Mason J at 478. Further, 'it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification. Similarly, if a claim be clear it is not to be made obscure simply because obscurities can be found in particular sentences in other parts of the document': Welch Perrin at 610 per Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ; see also Clorox at 261 [17]. (5) A patent specification must be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction. This involves construing the claims in a practical, commonsense manner, avoiding too technical or narrow a construction of the claims, and preferring a construction under which the invention will work to one where it may not work: Pfizer at 53-54, citing Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56. It also means construing the claims in light of what a reasonable person to whom the patent was addressed would have understood the language of the claim to mean: Kirin-Amgen at 453-454 [30], [32] and [34] per Lord Hoffman. (6) The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date. The words used in the specification and the claim are to be given the meaning that the skilled addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: Clorox at 261-262 [20]; D&eacute;cor at 391; PhotoCure at 85 [170]. (7) The proper construction of the specification is a matter of law for the Court to determine. However, evidence can be given by experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words that might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning: see Clorox at 262 [21]; see also Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control (2000) 49 IPR 225 ( 'Root Quality' ) at 237 [49]."
Case13922,applied,Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589,"Singh is therefore confronted with the fact that, by reason of his failure to read the SSAT's reasons for decision, or to have them translated to him, he did not raise, on merits review, an argument that would have been open to him. This brings into play the estoppel discussed in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589. There the High Court accepted as correct the extended principle expressed by Sir James Wigram VC in Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100 at 115; (1843) 67 ER 313 at 319: ""where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time."" In Anshun , the Court found that the principle laid down in Henderson extended beyond res judicata. That broader form of estoppel applies to this case. I note that Ryan J, in his reasons for directing non-acceptance of process given on 8 March 2006, relied upon Anshun . Had Mr Singh read the 13 May 2002 reasons for decision, he would have seen the sentence to which he now objects. He could then, as part of ordinary merits review, have challenged the correctness of the assertion contained within it, and arguably gained some support for his broader challenge to the 4 November 1999 decision. His failure to read the reasons for decision, whether through ""negligence, inadvertence or even accident"" led to his not having raised the point at a time when something could have been done about it. He cannot now, years later, having failed at all stages to demonstrate relevant legal error, come back to the Tribunal, and thence to this Court, with a point that should have been raised long before this."
Case24496,referred to,Re Polites: Ex parte Hoyts Corporation Pty Ltd (No 2) [1991] HCA 31 ; (1991) 173 CLR 78,"In Livesey 151 CLR at 293-294 the High Court referred to the principle laid down in R v Watson; Ex parte Armstrong [1976] HCA 39 ; (1976) 136 CLR 248 at 258-263 as follows: 'The principle is that a judge should not sit to hear a case if in all the circumstances the parties or the public might entertain a reasonable apprehension that he might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question involved in it.' This Court has adopted such principle in relation to matters arising in reviews under the Act: see NAHD of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 214 ALR 264 at [14] per Allsop J; see also: Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; 179 ALR 425. In J.R.L.; Ex parte C.J.L [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 351-352, Mason J said: 'The problem is governed by the principle that a judge should disqualify himself from hearing, or continuing to hear, the matter if the parties or the public entertain a reasonable apprehension that he might not bring an impartial an unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the issues: Reg v Watson; Ex parte Armstrong (25); Livesey v NSW Bar Association (26) . This principle, which has evolved from the fundamental rule of natural justice that a judicial officer should be free of bias, reflects a concern with the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. This concern is expressed in the cognate principle that, not only must justice be done, it must be seen to be done.' This principle has been repeatedly followed: see for example Re Polites: Ex parte Hoyts Corporation Pty Ltd (No 2) [1991] HCA 31 ; (1991) 173 CLR 78 at 85 and Re Finance Sector Union of Australia; Ex parte Illaton Pty Ltd (1992) 6 ALJR 583. In Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263 at 277 Kirby A-CJ said: 'But Vakauta and Grassy v The Queen (1989) 63 ALJR 630; 87 ALR 618, amount to timely reminders by the High Court of Australia of the high importance attached in the administration of justice in this country to the avoidance of pre-judgment or the appearance to the reasonable lay observer that a judge will approach his or her duties without complete impartiality. Confidence in judicial determinations would be shaken were insistence upon that feature of the judicial resolution of disputes in any way to be lessened. Vakauta and Grassy restate the importance attached to this abiding value of our legal system.'"

Case10764,cited,"Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1998) 16 ACLC 1,642","Section 477(2B) was enacted by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 (Cth) as a result of a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in its General Insolvency Inquiry, Report No 45, 1988, known as the Harmer Report. That report proposed the removal of restrictions requiring approvals to be obtained from the Court on various matters by liquidators and trustees in bankruptcy. It also proposed, that restrictions requiring prior approvals should be placed on, inter alia, ""the power to enter into long term commitments such as the mortgaging or leasing of property of the insolvent"" (Report Vol 1, [608]). That purpose was reflected in the Explanatory Memorandum for the 1992 Bill and led Austin J to conclude in Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1998) 16 ACLC 1,642 (at 1,649): It appears, therefore, that the purpose of s 477(2B) is, in the Harmer Report's words, to restrict the unfettered exercise of powers which may not be conducive to an expeditious and beneficial administration. That suggests that the role of the court, the committee of inspection or the creditors (as the case may be) is to review the liquidator's proposal by reference to those criteria. The role of the approving body, at any rate where that body is a court, is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal rather than to develop some alternative proposal which might seem to be preferable."
Case11555,cited,Hilder v Dexter [1902] AC 474,"It might be suggested that the Explanatory Memorandum ([21] above) is inconsistent with this principle insofar as it disregards ""any sort of discount or incentive"". However, the Memorandum is not to be taken too literally. For example, a range of ""kerbside valuations"" would hardly be a determination of market value binding on a court. In any event, an Explanatory Memorandum, however helpful, is not an expression of the will of Parliament and cannot prevail when a statute uses an expression, such as market value, to which courts of the highest authority have given a clear meaning. While Explanatory Memoranda are explicitly included in the extrinsic materials to which a court may give consideration under s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), there may still be something to be said for the trenchant view expressed by Lord Halsbury LC in Hilder v Dexter [1902] AC 474 at 477: ... I believe the worst person to construe (a statute) is the person who is responsible for its drafting. He is very much disposed to confuse what he intended to do with the effect of the language which in fact has been employed. 48 Mr Ferrier has applied a 10 per cent ""minority discount"". To some extent that overlaps with a further discount for litigation risk which he fixes at 25 per cent. 49 Mr Ferrier's figures quoted in [18] above do not take into account this latter discount because his instructions were to assume as a fact that the applicants (strictly speaking, that should be a hypothetical purchaser) would be able to establish oppression and obtain a winding up order. Mr Lipson's corresponding discount is 92.5 per cent, ie he assumes the chance of success at 7.5 per cent. The estimate of the prospects of success in litigation is probably not something within the specialised knowledge of a Chartered Accountant: see Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 79."
Case2148,referred to,Oakley Inc v Franchise China Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 404 ,"In Molnar Engineering Pty Ltd v Burns (1984) 3 FCR 68, the Full Court of this Court, in particular Smithers J and Keely J, recognised that the discretion was a broad one, to be exercised judicially depending on the existence of sufficient cause. See in particular Molnar at 74-75 per Smithers J and 80 per Keely J. In Termi-Mesh Australia Pty Ltd v Josu Manufacturing Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1241 , French J set out the guiding approach, which has been followed and applied by other judges of the Court: see Australian Communications Authority v Viper Communications Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 982 ; Oakley Inc v Franchise China Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 404. In Termi-Mesh French J said the following at [10]-[14]: Order 9 rule 1 of the Federal Court Rules provides, in the relevant parts: "" 1(1) A respondent may enter an appearance and may defend a proceeding by a solicitor or in person. . . . (3) Notwithstanding sub-rule (1) and subject to any Act, a corporation may not without the leave of the Court or a Judge enter an appearance or defend any proceeding except by a solicitor."" It should also be noted that O 4 r 14(2) provides that: ""Except as provided by or under any Act, a corporation may not, without the leave of the Court, commence or carry on any proceeding otherwise than by a solicitor."" The burden of authority in the Federal Court relates to the latter rule. Equivalent rules in other jurisdictions and particularly England and other Australian States set up an ""exceptional circumstances"" or like test before leave can be granted Arbuthnot Leasing International Ltd v Havelet Leasing Ltd [1991] 1 All ER 591; Bay Marine Pty Ltd v Clayton Country Properties Pty Ltd (1986) 8 NSWLR 104. In the latter case, Samuels JA in the New South Wales Court of Appeal, saw the court's discretion to dispense with its rules about representation as one to be exercised ""only with the most meticulous care"" and in exceptional circumstances. The position under the Federal Court Rules however is not as restrictive as that under the English Rules and various of the State Supreme Court Rules . In this respect I refer to what I said in Simto Resources Limited v Normandy Capital Limited (1993) 11 ACLC 856. Although the rationale for the restriction is basically the same in all jurisdictions, the power of the Federal Court to grant leave to a corporation to carry on a proceeding, otherwise than by a solicitor, is conferred as an integral part of the Rules in O 4 r 14 and O 9 r 1. There is no threshold requirement of special or exceptional circumstances. As Smithers J said of O 4 r 14(2) and O 9 r 3 in Molnar Engineering Pty Ltd v Burns (1984) 3 FCR 68 at 73: ""Those rules proceed on the basis that there is a discretion in the court to permit a company to commence and carry on any proceedings other than by a solicitor and to enter an appearance or defend any proceeding without a solicitor and, it would seem, it is a discretion to be exercised by reference to all relevant considerations."" Nevertheless the policy of the rule is clear that ordinarily a corporation will be required to be represented by a solicitor. Relevant factors for dispensing with that requirement include the financial capacity or lack of capacity of the corporation and those standing behind it, the effect of diverting company resources to paying legal expenses, the nature of the company's undertaking, its financial structure, its ability to retain and pay its staff and the identity and spread of its shareholders. The factual complexities of the case and the capacity of the proposed representative to conduct it effectively are also relevant VN International Video Pty Ltd v West End HK TVB Video &amp; Others (1996) 14 ACLC 1308. There is no doubt that those who chose to carry on their businesses through corporate structures enjoy advantages that those carrying on business on their own account do not enjoy. They also acquire disabilities and obligations. One of the disabilities is that which is imposed by the Rules of Court under consideration in this case. A distinction may be drawn between the case in which the company in question is applicant and that in which it is respondent. In the latter case it may be a more liberal approach to the grant of leave is warranted. ..."
Case21326,followed,Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Arthur Andersen &amp; Co (1997) 70 SASR 166,"In Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Arthur Andersen (1997) 70 SASR 166 at 174 Doyle CJ said: 'I conclude from this reference to authority that the claim of privilege will fail only if there is material raising an arguable case that the relevant communications were made for the purpose of furthering or assisting a crime or fraud, and that fraud in this context embraces a range of legal wrongs that have deception, deliberate abuse of or misuse of legal powers, or deliberate breach of a legal duty at their heart. It is not enough, I consider, that one could simply say that a transaction constituted sharp practice, or fell below the normal standard of commercial probity. It is not enough, I consider, that one would regard a transaction on which advice was sought as artificial, or as deliberately structured to take advantage of the law on a topic. In light of the authorities, one cannot be more precise than that. It is not necessary to show that the solicitor in question is implicated. What is in issue is the purpose of the client.' 32 Senior counsel for both the Sobey interests and for Mr Nicol said that his Honour's observations reflected the current state of the law. 33 They disagreed firstly as to whether the evidence on this application, in essence the affidavit of Mr Lockett, raised an arguable case that the relevant communications between the Sobey interests and Mr Tanti or other legal advisers from TP and the TP internal records were made for any identifiable purpose. They disagreed secondly upon whether, whatever the purpose for obtaining that legal advice may be, it would engage public policy so that the communications in issue would not be privileged from disclosure. 54 In HLC , the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia (Doyle CJ, Lander and Bleby JJ) held that a document recording information provided by a potential witness in litigation was privileged from production on the ground of legal professional privilege. There is no reason to regard 'litigation privilege' in that context differently from privilege arising from communications for the purpose of giving advice: see Propend , and per Doyle CJ in HLC at 364. That privilege was found to exist in HLC even though, at least arguably, the communication between the witness and the solicitor was not privileged. It existed because the document recording the statement was a communication by the solicitor who had taken the statement of the information provided by the witness, and had the necessary purpose (in that case, for use in existing litigation). See also Lander J at 370, and Bleby J at 371."
Case15433,referred to,Commissioner of Taxation v Glennan [1999] FCA 297 ; (1999) 90 FCR 538,"paragraph provides: [W]hether the Tribunal erred in law in failing to make any findings or give any consideration as to whether the receipts by the applicant which were treated as consideration for taxable supplies by the respondent were properly to be characterised as financial supplies on which no GST was payable because they were input taxed supplies; The contention here advanced was not advanced by the applicant before the Tribunal. There will be cases where a question of law arises from a failure on the part of the Tribunal to deal with an issue not put to it: see Carpentaria Transport Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 90 ATC 4590 at 4593 (Davies J), but generally this will not be so, and this case is no exception. There was no error of law on the part of the Tribunal in failing to consider and make findings as to whether the receipts by the applicant were properly to be characterised as consideration for financial supplies on which no GST was payable because they were input taxed supplies.

Where, however, there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused.

Case11127,discussed,Chappel v Hart [1998] HCA 55 ; (1998) 195 CLR 232,"am satisfied that Naturalcare, through Schadel, did rely upon the Quality Assurance representation and the Supply representation. Counsel for Pan relied upon some factors to negative reliance, for example, the intention to source product from Amrion; the pattern of purchase from other suppliers; the freedom reserved by Schadel to acquire goods from other suppliers if price were favourable; and the variety of manufacturers Naturalcare had listed with the TGA to manufacture its products. It is submitted for Pan that the express evidence of reliance given by Schadel should be given little or no weight, citing Chappel v Hart [1998] HCA 55 ; (1998) 195 CLR 232 at 246 n64. 96 Chappel v Hart does not compel that conclusion. Indeed, the absence of such evidence could be fatal to a claim of reliance and causation. In the present case, Schadel's evidence accords with commercial reality. Naturalcare continued to acquire most of its goods from Pan and was lulled into what was a false sense of security by the assurances over the years and entry into the Manufacturing Agreements. It is obvious that if Schadel had thought that there was any real danger of Pan losing its licence because of non-compliance with the Code, he would have taken steps to reorganise the business to minimise dependence upon Pan for supplies. In essence, Schadel was induced not to reorganise the Naturalcare business to reduce dependence upon Pan as a supplier. The misleading conduct does not have to be the sole cause of the action or inaction said to cause the damage ( I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 per Gleeson CJ at [33], per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [57], per McHugh J at [90] [93] per Callinan J at [216]). DAMAGES The assessment of damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) presents some problems. Damages have been assessed by Naturalcare by estimating the loss of gross profits on product supplied to it by Pan as at April 2003 and then deducting from that amount any savings in costs and incidentals for a period until alternative suppliers were found. There are issues as to the particular methodology employed to arrive at that result which may be put aside for the moment. It is submitted for Pan that the basic approach is flawed. If Schadel's evidence is accepted then, on the hypothesis as to liability being explored, he would have commenced decreasing his reliance on Pan from March 2002, both by obtaining products from a range of other suppliers and by developing more generic products rather than complex slurry mix soft gels dependent upon Pan's particular expertise. Pan complains that there has been no attempt to estimate the difference between the position that would have been arrived at as a result of that conduct and the situation which existed at the time of the recall. In other words, Naturalcare has quantified damage on the basis of the continued supply of Pan products rather than upon the hypothesis that there would have been a substitution for Pan's products. Naturalcare's claim for damages was formulated in a global fashion for all causes of action seeking to demonstrate what was lost by the inability to acquire and resell Pan products. It is submitted for Pan that this leaves the Court in a position where there is no proper basis for the assessment of damages in circumstances where a proper basis could, and should, have been put forward ( Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10 ; (2003) 196 ALR 257 at [38] per Hayne J; Optus Vision Pty Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited [2003] NSWSC 288 at [132] [137] (unaffected by the appeal at [2004] NSWCA 61). Naturalcare responds that the approach that it has taken is likely to underestimate the quantum of potential damages as it does not take into account the fact that if it had reorganised its business it would have been in a stronger position in the market following the Pan recall than it ultimately was as its competitors would have been adversely affected by the recall and it would not have been. It, therefore, would have been likely to have increased its market share. It is also submitted that the method chosen uses actual figures and so reduces the necessity for hypothetical estimates which would inevitably be speculative. In my opinion, the approach taken by Naturalcare is acceptable as a starting point ( Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 at [44] [52]). As it was induced to do nothing, it did not get out of the way and was a sitting duck when hit by the runaway train. Quantification of the effects of the train wreck is a good starting point for the assessment of loss. Of necessity, the assessment of damages in a case such as this is imprecise. There is a body of material in evidence as to the financial performance of the Naturalcare business prior to and after the suspension of licence and product recall which forms the raw material for the necessary assessment. The fact that the witnesses have approached the matter in one way or another is not decisive. If reorganisation of the business could have been completed so as to eliminate dependence upon Pan prior to the suspension of Pan's licence, then the proposed measure of damages would be a good proxy for the loss caused by the misleading and deceptive conduct. If reorganisation would not have been completed, there would need to be a discount to reflect the extent to which reorganisation would not have taken place. The evidence of what occurred in relation to reorganisation after the recall is of some value in assessing what may have occurred in the 12 months prior to it. However, the latter period was complicated by widespread effect of the failure of Pan, which meant that many other customers apart from Naturalcare were scrambling to obtain supply. I am not satisfied that the divorce from Pan would have been complete by the time of the suspension of the licence, even if commenced in March 2002. I agree with the submission by counsel for Naturalcare that the most striking aspect of the actual results post recall is the significant loss of total revenue by the business after the cessation of supply by Pan. The total revenue for the period 1 May 2001 to 30 April 2002 was $9 738 748 with an average monthly revenue of $811 562. In the period from 1 May 2002 to 30 April 2003, the total revenue was $11 240 026 with an average monthly revenue of $936 669. In the period from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004, the total revenue was $7 841 573 with an average monthly revenue of $653 464. In the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005, the total revenue was $10 667 344 with an average monthly revenue of $888 945. Thus, in what is roughly the year after the cessation of supply, the decrease in total revenue was $3 398 453 and in the ensuing 12 months the decrease was $572 682 in total which together can be rounded up to about $4 000 000. This pattern is broadly consistent with the evidence given as to the replacement of individual Pan products over the period. No other substantive reason has been advanced for the drop in revenue apart from the disturbance of supply of Pan products. I am satisfied that the interruption of supply was progressively alleviated over approximately two years. The total lost revenue in the two years would, as submitted by counsel for Naturalcare, understate the true loss as revenue had been on a rising plane up to the time of termination of supply by Pan. No doubt some of the effect of the unavailability of Pan products upon Naturalcare was due to Markethaven being unable to supply Pan products. It is reasonable to take account of that consequence because of the history of the relationship between Pan, Markethaven and Naturalcare. Pan endeavoured to establish that Naturalcare had not taken reasonable or timely steps to obtain substituted supplies more quickly. There was an attempt to use cross-examination and some evidence to show that Naturalcare had not acted reasonably as there were sources of supply not examined at all or not examined promptly. In my opinion, that endeavour was unsuccessful. Naturalcare had every commercial reason to take all steps open to it to minimise the loss. There is no reason to doubt the motivation to do so. In assessing the situation it is necessary to bear in mind what was said by Lord Macmillan in the well known passage from Banco de Portugal v Waterlow &amp; Sons Ltd [1932] UKHL 1 ; [1932] AC 452 (at 506): 'It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it, but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency. The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures, and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken.' It is also necessary to bear in mind that Schadel's reliance on Selim had limited his knowledge of the market. Even if the result was not perfect, I am satisfied that Naturalcare took reasonable steps to restore supply. Loss of gross revenue is not the measure of loss to the business. It is quite obvious, however, that a sudden loss of revenue by a continuing business will inevitably lead to a net loss. Fixed costs and many of the variable costs will remain. There was a good deal of attention in the evidence and in the submissions to assessing the net revenue lost. In my opinion, the endeavour by Naturalcare to found upon a gross profit margin applicable only to the goods supplied by Pan is not appropriate to an exercise to determine damages for breach of s 52. I am satisfied that, in this respect, it is appropriate to adopt a margin of 45 per cent in accordance with the opinion of Mr McGuiness. However, having studied his report, and taking into account his evidence under cross-examination, his assessment of MSD costs and other operating expenses and the saving of wages costs are all too high. In my opinion, they should be approximately 15 per cent in total, rather than 20 per cent as he proposed. Therefore, in broad terms, the loss of net revenue is calculated as follows: loss of revenue $4 000 000 x gross profit margin 45 per cent = $1 800 000, less costs etc x 15 per cent = $270 000, leaving net revenue of $1 530 000. Allowance then needs to be made for the overlap between that amount and the loss of profit on goods returned and goods ordered but not supplied. Then there should be some discount for the uncertainty as to whether the business would have been completely reorganised by the time of the licence suspension and for other uncertainties. The principal difference between the parties in relation to the goods returned and goods not supplied claim relates to the gross profit margin. Naturalcare claims a gross margin of 58.5 per cent for goods sourced from Pan moderated to 55.2 per cent if freight is taken into account. In my opinion, the criticisms of the foundation for that claim made by McGuiness are valid. I prefer to adopt for those purposes the yardsticks I have adopted for the umbrella claim, ie gross margin of 45 per cent and MSD etc of 15 per cent. The amount which is to be allowed for loss of profits on those claims is to be deducted from the overall amount I found for net loss. I would then discount the net amount by 20 per cent to take account of the uncertainties to which I have referred. I do not see the necessity for any discount back to a present value at the date of breach. The time has now elapsed. The amounts in question reflect the dollar values at the time during the period of loss. On that basis, interest would not run from the date of breach but should be calculated to reflect the progressive occurrence of loss. The amount of judgment should also reflect amounts allowed for direct expenses incurred due to the disruption such as the packaging, costs of registration and so on. Unless there are special reasons to the contrary, costs should follow the event. The proceeding will stand over to enable counsel for Naturalcare to bring in draft orders to reflect these reasons, including calculation of the amounts for damages and interest. The parties should also draw my attention to any issue that has been overlooked. I certify that the preceding one hundred and six (106) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.

Case5677,applied,M172 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 23,"In M172 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 23 (' M172 case '), Bryant CFM said the following, at [28]: All the Australian authorities require some defect in the decision making process. Re MIMIA; Ex Parte Lam (2003) HCA 6 where at para 105 McHugh and Gummow JJ said: But the failure to meet that expectation does not reasonably found a case of denial of natural justice. The notion of legitimate expectation serves only to focus attention on the content of the requirement of natural justice in this particular case. The ends sought to be attained by the requirement of natural justice may be variously identified. But at least in a case such as this the concern is with the fairness of the procedure adopted rather than the fairness of the outcome. It is with the decision-making process not the decision, as Lord Brightman put it (98). What is delivered by the requirement of natural justice is the right to a hearing, a technical expression in law, before action is taken. 19 Clearly, the appellant made a choice, of exactly the same kind described by Dowsett J in B41 of 2003 . It is not a case, such as that which confronted the Court in the M172 case where the appellant's migration adviser responded on his behalf, contrary to instructions and declined the invitation."
Case12574,referred to,CGU Insurance Ltd and Others v Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad [2001] FCA 1223 ; (2001) 187 ALR 279,"necessity to make enquiries from other sources was considered by Tamberlin J in CGU Insurance Ltd and Others v Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad [2001] FCA 1223 ; (2001) 187 ALR 279 at [23] - [27] . At [25] his Honour said: The provision does not contemplate an order where some reasonable inquiries have been made but rather where all reasonable inquiries have been made. It appears to contemplate a reasonable exhaustion of alternative sources of information and, in any particular case, involves a pragmatic balancing of considerations. The power of the Court arises after the applicant has made all reasonable inquiries and finds that there is insufficient information to enable a decision to be made. There is no evidence of any attempts made by HID to ascertain from Gemalto whether the exclusivity arrangement existed. However, the question is whether it is reasonable to expect that HID would, prior to commencing litigation, inquire of Gemalto whether it held an exclusivity arrangement. That is, whether it was reasonable to expect that it would ask its competitor to provide information which relates solely to a commercial transaction made between Gemalto and Keycorp, in respect of which HID was an unsuccessful bidder. The Court is not persuaded that it was reasonable for HID, a commercial competitor of Gemalto, to have made such inquiries of Gemalto concerning the existence of any exclusivity arrangement between Gemalto and Keycorp. Therefore, such an inquiry was not necessary to satisfy the first requirement of O 15A r 6(b), namely that HID make 'all reasonable inquiries . '"

His Notice of Appeal was filed on 23 December 2008 and his Grounds of Appeal assert three alleged errors committed by the Refugee Review Tribunal, namely: (i) a failure "" to exercise its duty under the Migration Act not to put any weight to the documents which I submitted before the Tribunal to support my claim ""; (ii) a contention that the Tribunal "" underestimated my inability of politics and my involvement with the BNP ...

Case16400,cited,Ogawa v The University of Melbourne (No 2) [2004] FCA 1275,"In Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2006] FCA 1537 Kenny J at [26] recently noted that courts have from time to time overcome a reluctance to order indemnity costs against self-represented litigants: Bhagat v Global Custodians [2002] FCAFC 51 and Ogawa v The University of Melbourne (No 2) [2004] FCA 1275. Kenny J considered the competing interests in determining whether to make an award of indemnity costs against a self-represented litigant. A lack of knowledge of the law, unfamiliarity with court practice and a lack of objectivity are common traits of unrepresented litigants. A person's ability to get redress should not depend on lawyerly skills or an ability to pay for legal representation. However, the Court owes a duty to all parties to ensure that the trial is conducted in a fair and timely fashion (at [28]) and without significant difficulties and unnecessary expense for the parties against whom an unrepresented litigant proceeds. see Bhagat v Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Life Assurance Australia Ltd [2000] NSWSC 159 at [13] per Hodgson CJ.

Case2058,followed,VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158,"The grounds of review which the appellant seeks to raise in her amended notice of appeal do not appear on their face to be within the grounds that were raised before the Federal Magistrate. However, I think it is arguable that they fell within the unreasonableness ground and, in any event, counsel for the Minister disclaimed any prejudice to the Minister by the raising of these grounds on appeal. Accordingly, applying the principles stated by a Full Court in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] to [48], I would be prepared to grant leave to the appellant to raise the grounds on the appeal. That, of course, is not to say that amended grounds could be raised on appeal if the principles referred to by the High Court in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7-8 are infringed."
Case13733,referred to,Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420,"Section 153B(1) of the Act relevantly provides that: ""If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made ...the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy."" Section 153B(1) and its predecessors have been considered in many decisions of this and other Courts. These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions. They are: (1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402. (2) An applicant who seeks an annulment of his or her bankruptcy ""carries a heavy burden"". It is incumbent on an applicant ""to place before the Court all relevant material with respect to his or her financial affairs so that the Court may be properly informed and may make a judgment that is based on the actual circumstances of the applicant"": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531. (3) In determining whether or not a sequestration order ""ought not to have been made"" the Court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made on the facts known to the Court at the time at which it was made. The Court must take account of facts, known at the time at which the sequestration order was made and at which it determines an annulment application, even if those facts were not before the Court at the time at which the sequestration order was made: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243; Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426. (4) A sequestration order ""ought not to have been made"" if, on the facts known at the time of the annulment application, the Court would have been bound not to make the sequestration order: Re Frank; ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396. (5) The Court will be so satisfied if it is established that the debtor was not, at the time the sequestration order was made, indebted to the petitioning creditor: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420 at 422. (6) If the Court is so satisfied, it is not precluded from annulling the bankruptcy because the bankrupt had not sought to have the default judgment set aside or failed to oppose the creditor's petition or failed to seek a review of the sequestration order: Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426. (7) The power conferred on the Court by s 153B(1) is discretionary in nature. Even if persuaded that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, the Court can, in appropriate circumstances, decline to annul the bankruptcy: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243. (8) Considerations which may have a bearing on the exercise of discretion include unexplained delay in the making of the application, whether or not the applicant is solvent, whether or not the applicant has made full disclosure of his or her financial affairs and a failure by the bankrupt to oppose the creditor's petition and attend the hearing at which the sequestration order was made: Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 24-5; Boles at 247; Re Papps; ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531; Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [79] ; Cottrell v Wilcox [2002] FCA 1115 at [7] .

Case4488,cited,Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1,"In addition, there are a few matters in respect of which it is not at all clear that, had the issues been raised by the applicant for consideration, the evidence would have remained as it was before the Tribunal. As discussed in more detail below, in the course of considering the several matters raised by the applicant, the matters now raised under (1), (2) and (5) above and possibly in (3) above may have led to there being more evidence before the Tribunal pertaining to them. For example, there may have been evidence from Dr Macris as to the significance, if any, of the additional medical history to him issuing the CMF to the respondent. There may have been evidence from Dr Bauze and Dr Brooks, and perhaps other evidence, as to the relationship between the diseased condition of the respondent's right knee and the aggravation of the diseased condition of his left knee. There may have been further evidence from the applicant about his state of mind at the time he was examined by Dr Macris concerning his capacity to do the proposed work on the Iron Chieftain. There may have been other relevant communications between the applicant and the respondent, or between the applicant and others such as medical practitioners. That is not of course intended to be exhaustive, or necessarily correct. It is really speculative as to how the hearing before the Tribunal would have proceeded if those issues had been properly signalled. Such considerations, however, do indicate that it would not be appropriate now to permit those matters to be raised: see. eg. Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7-8; University of Wollongong v Metwally (No 2) [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 59 ALJR 481 at 483. I shall nevertheless consider each of the matters sought to be raised by the applicant, even though in some instances the material available may not be the full material which would have been available had the applicant raised those issues before the Tribunal."
Case8574,applied,Cran v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 92 ; (2004) 62 NSWLR 95,"It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can, on occasion, be ""inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of [their public] responsibilities"": cf Sullivan v Moody , at [62]; (whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law) and to be impermissible for that reason. As the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Tame illustrate, this inconsistency is often revealed where, in a setting in which injury is foreseeable if care is not taken in the conduct of a police investigation, a suspect, a victim, or a third party injured by acts or omissions of the police seeks to raise a claim in negligence against the police: Hill , above; Thompson v Vincent [2005] NSWCA 219 at [152] - [154] ; Batchelor v State of Tasmania [2005] TASSC 11 ; Cran v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 92 ; (2004) 62 NSWLR 95; see also D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 214 ALR 92 at [101] ; State of New South Wales v Paige [2002] NSWCA 235 ; (2002) 60 NSWLR 371 at [115] - [117] . Save in exceptional circumstances: cf Hill at 62; Batchelor , above; and in North America see e.g. Doe v Board of Commissioners for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (1990) 72 DLR 4 th 580 (""Doe""); Eaton, ""Liability of Municipality or Other Governmental Unit for Failure to Provide Police Protection from Crime"" 90 ALR 5 th 273 at SS4 ; 57 Am Jur 2d, ""Municipal, County, School and State Tort Liability"", SSSS407-418; such attempts have been unsuccessful. 95 Hill's case, I would note, has been referred to approvingly in some number of High Court judgments: see e.g. Sullivan v Moody at [57]; Tame at [231], [335]; see also Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; Cran v State of New South Wales , at [33] ff; but cf contra Zalewski v Turcarolo [1995] 2 VR 562 a decision which pre-dated Sullivan v Moody . 98 What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above (including that of England) is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that, particularly in cases of omissions to act, the police may nonetheless have, or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a ""special relationship"" with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her: see e.g. Brooks v Commissioner of Police at [22] and [29]; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ; in US jurisdictions the ""special relationship"" exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity, see e.g. Eaton, above at SS4 ; see also 57 Am Jur 2d, above, at SS410 ff. What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular ""operational"" context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist. Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody: Hall v Whatmore , above; and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation D'Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at [101]-[102]; see also Cran v State of New South Wales , above; or in preventing a breach of the peace: Thompson v Vincent , above. 99 Australian case law, while generally conforming in its results with particularly comparable English decisions, has not unreservedly committed itself to the public policy immunity prevailing in England. The Court of Appeal of New South Wales on a number of occasions and most recently in Cran v State of New South Wales has adopted an approach to cases involving investigative conduct that reflects the immunity principle found in English decisions and particularly Hill's case. In Cran v State of New South Wales it was noted by Santow JA that in Tame's case, ""there are strong dicta suggesting that the English authorities would be followed in Australia"" (at [35]) and that ""on present authority [in New South Wales] the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the police ... preclude[d] any duty of care to the appellant"" (at [63]) in that case where a prisoner claimed damages for post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from unnecessarily prolonged imprisonment because of delay in a police investigation. 104 As I earlier noted, the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at [60] above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation. Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame . In its apparent endorsement of Hill at [57] in the above quotation, Sullivan along with Hill and D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above, have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is ""an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public"": Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]. Again, as I have already noted, Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation. 117 In the cases of Scott Rush and of the other applicants the duty contended for cannot be reconciled with the nature and purpose of the functions being exercised by the AFP officers concerned, the discretions conferred on them in virtue of the task they were involved in, and the policy directive they were, apparently, implementing: cf Sullivan v Moody at [62]. Accordingly, to adopt Santow JA's observations in Cran v State of New South Wales at [63], the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the AFP precludes in this case any duty of care owed to Scott Rush or to the other applicants. Such is the current law in this country and the policy informing it, that the interests of the applicants were subordinated to the public interests served by the AFP in their conduct of the investigation in question."
Case22558,referred to,Hill v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCAFC 23,"In reaching the conclusion that it did, there was no dispute that the Tribunal considered that it should follow and, in fact, did follow the Deledio methodology. As to the first two steps in the Deledio methodology, the Tribunal was satisfied that: (1) "" a hypothesis connecting the injury or disease of anxiety disorder and alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse ...with service [did] exist because there [was] material pointing to it [and that] hypothesis raised emerged ... obviously and directly from the evidence... (refer Hill v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCAFC 23 at paragraph 98) ""; (2) there were SoPs with respect to generalised anxiety disorder (No. 1 of 2000) (""the Anxiety SoP"") and alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse (No. 76 of 1998) (""the Alcohol SoP""); (3) with respect to the Anxiety SoP, the applicable factor was "" experiencing a severe psychosocial stressor within the two years immediately before the clinical onset of anxiety disorder"" : factor 5(a)(ii). The expression "" severe psychosocial stressor "" was defined in para 8 of the Anxiety SoP to mean "" an identifiable occurrence that evokes feelings of substantial distress in an individual, for example, being shot at, death or serious injury of a close friend or relative, assault (including sexual assault), major illness or injury, experiencing a loss such as divorce or separation, loss of employment, major financial problems or legal problems ""; (4) with respect to the Alcohol SoP, the applicable factor was "" experiencing a severe stressor within the two years immediately before the clinical onset of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse"" : factor 5(b). 19 The third step of the Deledio methodology required the Tribunal to examine if the hypothesis was reasonable. The Tribunal found that the hypotheses were reasonable on the grounds that there was material pointing to the veteran having experienced a "" severe psychosocial stressor "" and a "" severe stressor "" within two years immediately before the clinical onset of the respective disorders. 20 The fourth step of the Deledio methodology required the Tribunal to make findings of fact to determine whether it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the incapacity did not arise from a war-caused injury. The Tribunal made the following findings of fact: (1) the veteran drank minimum quantities of alcohol on an infrequent basis both prior to enlistment and prior to commencing his service in Vietnam; (2) during his service in Vietnam, he "" became apprehensive and fearful by a number of circumstances to which he had no direct involvement but by reason of his location he was concerned that they could get [him] "" (original emphasis); (3) a helicopter incident in Vietnam was the most significant event to which the veteran was exposed and prior to that helicopter incident, the veteran was emotionally vulnerable. The helicopter incident was described in the following terms: ""the [veteran] was a passenger ... where he heard someone say "" we've been hit "" and the helicopter suddenly lurched. Door gunners then opened fire from each side of the helicopter, it descended quickly, the [veteran] thought that it would crash and on landing, an inspection revealed the presence of a bullet or a bullet hole. Whilst there were slight variations in that account of the episode by the [veteran's] colleagues .., the incident itself and the circumstances immediately before landing, were corroborated. Indeed, [one colleague] said that he "" feared that we would not make it "" and [another colleague] said that he observed the [veteran] to be shaken. [The second colleague] said that he continues to have nightmares and dreams about that incident."" (Emphasis original) (4) as a result of the helicopter incident, the veteran significantly increased his alcohol consumption "" to help him cope and to help him sleep"" ; (5) the helicopter incident was, within the meaning of the respective SoPs, a "" severe psychosocial stressor "" and a "" severe stressor "" and did occur within two years of the clinical onset of the respective diseases. In particular, the Tribunal was satisfied that the veteran, within two years of the helicopter incident, exhibited features or symptoms which would have caused a medical practitioner to diagnose the relevant disease or injury as then being present; and (6) the veteran's injuries of anxiety and alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence were war-caused."
Case890,cited,NP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley (2001) 80 SASR 151,"I should also note that examinees were even given an opportunity to raise an issue as to a possible third-party privilege. No doubt this is the best policy, but whether it was required as a matter of law may be doubted: see Rochfort at 145-47 (noting that in general effort should be made to respect potential interests of the third-party lawyer but that there are various circumstances where the interests of justice will trump protection of those interests). In MM , Emmett J held that a person must be given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of others as well as himself or herself. In support of this proposition, his Honour relied on the Full Court's decision in Citibank ; however, that decision was disapproved by the later Full Court decision in JMA . Moreover, the conclusion in MM rested on a premise which may be in doubt. Emmett J reasoned (at [35]) that an examinee ""would be obliged to make claims for privilege in respect of documents where the privilege might reasonably be expected to exist in order to ensure that such a claim for privilege would not be lost ."" (Emphasis added.) In other words, his Honour found that the obligation to make a claim on behalf of others must exist in order to prevent waiver. However, as I have already noted, and as the parties in this case recognised from the start, only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Thus there is no possibility that the failure of an employee to claim privilege on behalf of the corporation would result in waiver or loss of the privilege (except perhaps where the employee is authorised to waive the privilege). To the contrary, it is precisely if a general duty to claim the privilege is imposed that a risk of waiver arises - that is, imagine that an employee under a duty was given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of the employer but failed to do so; under Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 that would be conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege and would mean that any employee, without the knowledge or authority of the corporate employer, could waive the corporation's privilege. For those reasons, it does not seem either necessary or wise to impose a general obligation on an examinee to claim privilege on behalf of a third party, nor to create a general obligation on behalf of the examiner to give the examinee a reasonable opportunity to make such a claim. While an employee may have an obligation in contract or equity to maintain the confidences of his or her employer ( NP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley (2001) 80 SASR 151 at [16]-[19]), that cannot be converted into an ability to control the exercise of the employer's legal professional privilege."
Case8077,cited,Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60,"Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen ""the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases"": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . 6 Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings; (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial; (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial; (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party. See Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923 at [5] ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [42] - [48] ; Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574 at [13] ; Bond v Barry (2007) 73 IPR 490 at [46]; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in Liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [21] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited [2008] FCAFC 60. . 30 The respondents contend however that, whatever be the position in relation to the Contract to Lease, none of this extrinsic material is even arguably relevant to the construction of the option in the Lease itself which they say is clear in its terms and was drawn by the applicants' solicitors. I do not consider that this necessarily follows. The context, background or history to the Contract to Lease may arguably, in my view, also be relevant to a consideration of what is intended by the option in the Lease. The Contract for Lease, as I observed earlier, by clause 23 contemplated that any Lease would contain the terms of the offer in the Contract to Lease. Both are inter-related in this sense. There was no evidence as to what instructions were given by the applicants to their solicitors for the preparation of the Lease. It is reasonable to infer however that they were provided with the Contract to Lease: Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [132] per Gordon J. It is hardly surprising then that any ambiguity, absurdity or shortcoming in the Contract to Lease, could be repeated in the Lease. Additionally, in respect to the Lease, relevant extrinsic evidence would arguably also include a consideration of the conversations which, on the applicants' case, took place on 3 April 2006, concerning payment of rates and taxes as well as the content of the settlement statements sent to Mr Reynolds on 3 and 4 April 2006."
Case8041,referred to,Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336,"Mr Rambaldi argued that bad faith is a serious allegation and that the Court must reach a comfortable satisfaction that the case is made out in accordance with the Briginshaw test: see Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 ("" Briginshaw "") at 361-362 per Dixon J. He submitted that, as there is no precise definition of bad faith, whether the case is made out will depend on the particular facts. Mr Rambaldi contested that there were any grounds in this case for concluding that he had acted in bad faith. Mr Spalla had failed, so Mr Rambaldi said, to adduce evidence to satisfy the Court, on the balance of probabilities, that, in entering into the irrevocable offer, Mr Rambaldi was actuated by bad faith. 148 Further, counsel for Mr Rambaldi contended that Mr Rambaldi, at all times, acted in good faith. Counsel asked for a positive finding that Mr Rambaldi was acting in good faith when he entered into the offer and recommended to his partners that it should be given effect. A key element of Mr Rambaldi's submissions was his claim that a liquidator who is not funded or is without indemnity is not expected to continue a proceeding. Accordingly, Mr Rambaldi could not have been expected to continue his involvement in the primary proceeding beyond 6 May 2005. Mr Rambaldi noted that Mr Borden, who was the lawyer of Mr Rambaldi and Mr Spalla jointly, had said that Mr Rambaldi could not be expected to continue the proceedings without an indemnity and would be entitled to accept a walk-away offer in those circumstances. 149 Mr Rambaldi argued that, once he was informed on 29 April 2005 that his indemnity was to be withdrawn, he knew that he would not be able to continue with the litigation after 6 May 2005 and he behaved reasonably to protect the interests of creditors in those circumstances. He said that he procured an offer at the mediation that would stay open for seven days, thereby providing an opportunity for options for continuing the litigation to be explored. He claimed that he procured his partners' consent to the Deed only after no reasonable way to continue the litigation was found. He said that his conduct was consistent with the LFA. Mr Spalla was utterly wrong to characterize what he did to preserve Mr Spalla's position for seven days as a ""facade"". 166 Mr Spalla has attempted to satisfy this standard of review by showing that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith in executing the Deed. This is a serious allegation, involving the imputation of moral turpitude. The standard of proof to be applied is proof on the preponderance of probability with due regard to the seriousness of the particular issue being determined. As Dixon J said in Briginshaw at 361-362: "" [W] hen the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. It cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. ... Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature or consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters 'reasonable satisfaction' should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences."" An allegation of bad faith is a serious claim affecting reputation and the Court should have regard to this when considering the evidence. 167 Section 181(1) of the Act relevantly provides that an officer of a corporation a term that includes a liquidator (s 9) - must exercise powers and discharge duties in good faith in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose. Whether there has been bad faith will depend on the particular circumstances of the case."
Case15410,considered,Duong v Australian Postal Corporation (2005) 41 AAR 288,"Mr Sellick submits that where an appeal lies under s 44 of the AAT Act, applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act should be dismissed unless the subject of the appeal is a decision going to practice and procedure. He relies on Duong v Australian Postal Corporation (2005) 41 AAR 288 at [12] where Edmonds J dismissed an ADJR Act application where the Tribunal decision did not go to practice and procedure. His Honour followed Tuite v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [1993] FCA 71 ; (1993) 40 FCR 483 where Davies J had held that, as s 44 of the AAT Act provides a specific procedure for the granting of relief by the Court in respect of decisions of the AAT, that procedure should be adopted and applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act, where an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act is available, should be dismissed as of course (at 484). Justice Davies expressed the view at 484 that questions of law as provided for in s 44 of the AAT Act encompass grounds enunciated in s 5 of the ADJR Act. Duong was decided prior to Etheridge , a decision of the Full Court and Tuite was decided prior to Birdseye, which discussed the difficulties in the framing of questions of law . Further, the ADJR Act is not only available for matters of practice and procedure ( Bond at 337 per Mason CJ; Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 at [89] [90] per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ). 103 Australia Post submits that Duong and Tuite should not be followed. It submits that s 10 of the ADJR Act makes it plain that the rights conferred by that Act are in addition to the rights otherwise conferred to review decisions. Mr Sellick submits that, if there is concurrent jurisdiction, the Court should exercise in discretion so that the grounds of review under the ADJR Act are no more extensive than questions of law available under the AAT Act."
Case9549,cited,Sachtler GmbH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 788 ; (2005) 65 IPR 605,"parties' written submissions referred to numerous authorities on the construction of patents, and, in particular, on the construction of patent claims. I need not refer to more than the following: The construction of a specification is a question of law and belongs to the Court: Hill v Evans (1862) 1A IPR 1 ( Hill v Evans ) at 3; The Court must construe the specification as it would be understood by the notional skilled addressee as at the relevant date: Hill v Evans at 3-4; D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 ( D&eacute;cor ) at 400; Flexible Steel Lacing Co v Beltreco Ltd [2000] FCA 890 ; (2000) 49 IPR 331 ( Flexible Steel Lacing ) at [81]; Evidence from a skilled addressee in the field of the invention as to how he or she would have understood the specification at the relevant date is relevant evidence for the purposes of s 55(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (Evidence Act): EI Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co v Imperial Chemicals Industries plc [2002] FCA 230 ; (2002) 54 IPR 304 at 320-322; Flexible Steel Lacing at [81]; Clorox Australia Pty Ltd v International Consolidated Business Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 254 at [21]; Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 980 ; (2000) 177 ALR 231 at [49] ; The claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, and the rest of the specification may explain the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of technical terms, or aid in the resolving of ambiguities in the construction of the claims: Clorox at [16]; Sachtler GmbH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 788 ; (2005) 65 IPR 605 ( Sachtler ) at [42]; A patent specification must be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction, and must be construed in a practical commonsense manner avoiding a too technical or narrow construction in favour of a construction under which the invention will work, as against one according to which it may not work: Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56; Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Ely Lilly &amp; Co [2005] FCAFC 224 ; (2005) 225 ALR 416 ( Pfizer v Eli Lilly ) at [249]-[250]; The hypothetical addressee of the patent is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date, and the words used in the specification and the claims are to be given the meanings that that skilled addressee would give them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: Clorox at [20]; D&eacute;cor at 391; PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston [2005] FCA 344 ; (2005) 216 ALR 41 at [170] . Professors Banwell and Davies on the meaning that the Patent claims would convey to the hypothetical skilled chemist at the priority date Alphapharm submits that ""the wording of the claims makes it clear that the relevant area has been deliberately left outside the claim"", citing Sachtler at [53]. Alphapharm submits that the cross-examination of Professor Banwell established that the steps of the A process were different from the integers of Claim 6(b). Another defence raised by Alphapharm concerns the definition of ""exploit"" in Schedule 1 to the Act. Section 13(1) of the Act provides that, subject to the Act, a patent gives the patentee the exclusive rights, during the term of the patent, to exploit the invention and to authorise another person to do so. Section 13(3) provides that a patent ""has effect throughout the patent area"". The definition of ""exploit"" in the Dictionary in Schedule 1 is as follows: exploit , in relation to an invention includes: (a) where the invention is a product make, hire, sell or otherwise dispose of the product, offer to make, sell, hire or otherwise dispose of it, use or import it, or keep it for the purpose of doing any of those things; or (b) where the invention is a method or process use the method or process or do any act mentioned in paragraph (a) in respect of a product resulting from such use. Alphapharm submits that para (b) of the definition requires that the use of the method or process be in the ""patent area"". The ""patent area"" is defined in the Dictionary in Schedule 1 and may, for convenience, be thought of as being ""Australia"". Consideration of the claim of infringement of the product claims (claims 1, 3 and 5) The authorities relating to infringement were recently reviewed by Bennett J in Sachtler at [43]-[67]. Her Honour cautioned against the purported application of the ""pith and marrow"" or ""substance of the invention"" approach, untrammelled by the form of the claims (at [55]). It is necessary for the Court to construe claim 6(b) in the light of the common general knowledge as at the priority date. How would the non-inventive person skilled in the art at that time, possessed of that common general knowledge, have understood the words of the claim?"
Case21840,referred to,Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Pty Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405,"In this case there is no information which falls within the terms of s 7(3). None of the witnesses who gave evidence relevant to the question of obviousness identified prior art information, either a single piece or a combination, which they said a person skilled in the relevant art could before 21 December 1998 (that is, the priority date of the Patent) be reasonably expected to have ascertained, understood and regarded as relevant (or, in an appropriate case, combined). In those circumstances it is not necessary to consider the extent of the relaxation of the rules under the repealed s 100(1)(c) of the Patents Act 1952 (Cth) effected by s 7(3): Elconnex Pty Ltd v Gerard Industries Pty Ltd (1991) 32 FCR 491 ("" Elconnex ""); Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Pty Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405 ("" Tidy Tea ""); Firebelt Pty Ltd v Brambles Australia Ltd (t/as Cleanaway) [2002] HCA 21 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 816 at 821-823 [31] - [36] ("" Firebelt ""). 145 In Elconnex , Burchett J said (at 507): ""While the hypothetical skilled worker, against whose efforts the claimed invention is to be tested, may be taken to have extensive knowledge, he must be uninventive. Even a small inventive element is sufficient to sustain a patent. However, there is a great difference between the simple idea which really breaks new ground and an unimaginative extension of well-known techniques into a closely similar area. Of course, if the area is not closely similar, so that an imaginative leap (even perhaps a small one) is required to perceive that the techniques are applicable to it, there will be invention."" (See also Tidy Tea at 413-415.) The particular question of the test of obviousness when faced with a patent involving what is said to be a new combination made up of old integers was discussed by Aickin J in Minnesota Mining . His Honour said (at 293): ""In the case of alleged lack of an inventive step the question of making a mosaic must operate (if at all) in a very different matter. An allegation of want of inventive step is not made out by saying you may take one or two, or twenty-one or twenty-two, prior publications and then select from them appropriate extracts or pieces of information, which will add up to the invention claimed and so demonstrate that it was obvious. So to proceed is to mistake the nature of an invention and the nature of the objection of obviousness. The question is, is the invention itself obvious, not whether a diligent searcher might find pieces from which there might have been selected the elements which make up the patent. If this were not so, there could never be a valid patent for a new combination of old integers. The proper question is not whether it would have been obvious to the hypothetical addressee who was presented with an ex post facto selection of prior specifications that elements from them could be combined to produce a new product or process. It is rather whether it would have been obvious to a non-inventive skilled worker in the field to select from a possibly very large range of publications the particular combination subsequently chosen by the opponent in the glare of hindsight and also whether it would have been obvious to that worker to select the particular combination of integers from those selected publications. In the case of a combination patent the invention will lie in the selection of integers, a process which will necessarily involve rejection of other possible integers. The prior existence of publications revealing those integers, as separate items, and other possible integers does not of itself make an alleged invention obvious. It is the selection of the integers out of, perhaps many possibilities, which must be shown to be obvious."""
Case3590,discussed,Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387,"Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387 ("" Applicant S ""), the High Court held that a young Afghan man who had a well-founded fear of being forcibly conscripted to fight for the Taliban could fall within the definition of a refugee. It was not necessary that society perceive young able-bodied men as comprising a particular social group in order to conclude that they were a particular social group within the definition of a refugee. It is sufficient if they are cognisable within the community as a particular social group. Such conclusions are clearly objective, although, that is not to say that subjective perceptions within the community may not be relevant. Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (at 400-401 [36]): ""Therefore, the determination of whether a group falls within the definition of 'particular social group' in Art 1A(2) of the Convention can be summarised as follows. First, the group must be identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group. Secondly, the characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group cannot be the shared fear of persecution. Thirdly, the possession of that characteristic or attribute must distinguish the group from society at large. Borrowing the language of Dawson J in Applicant A , a group that fulfils the first two propositions, but not the third, is merely a 'social group' and not a 'particular social group'. As this Court has repeatedly emphasised, identifying accurately the 'particular social group' alleged is vital for the accurate application of the applicable law to the case in hand."" (Citations omitted.) The Court rejected a submission that there can only be persecution if enmity or malignity is present (at 401 [38]). The Court also addressed a submission that there was no persecution where the foreseeable risk of harm arose from the application of a law of general application. Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (at 402-403 [42]-[44]): ""A law of general application is capable of being implemented or enforced in a discriminatory manner. The criteria for the determination of whether a law or policy that results in discriminatory treatment actually amounts to persecution were articulated by McHugh J in Applicant A . His Honour said that the question of whether the discriminatory treatment of persons of a particular race, religion, nationality or political persuasion or who are members of a particular social group constitutes persecution for that reason ultimately depends on whether that treatment is 'appropriate and adapted to achieving some legitimate object of the country [concerned]'. These criteria were accepted in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Chen . As a matter of law to be applied in Australia, they are to be taken as settled. This is what underlay the Court's decision in Israelian . Namely, that enforcement of the law of general application in that particular case was appropriate and adapted to achieving a legitimate national objective. In Applicant A , McHugh J went on to say that a legitimate object will ordinarily be an object the pursuit of which is required in order to protect or promote the general welfare of the State and its citizens. His Honour gave the examples that (i) enforcement of a generally applicable criminal law does not ordinarily constitute persecution; and (ii) nor is the enforcement of laws designed to protect the general welfare of the State ordinarily persecutory. Whilst the implementation of these laws may place additional burdens on the members of a particular race, religion or nationality, or social group, the legitimacy of the objects, and the apparent proportionality of the means employed to achieve those objects, are such that the implementation of these laws is not persecutory.

Case23520,cited,Champagne View Pty Ltd v Shearwater Resort Management Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 214,"the exercise of this discretion, one matter to be considered is whether or not there has been any hearing on the merits. In the absence of a hearing, it has been said that each party must bear its own costs "" except in special circumstances "": Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission (1997) 80 FCR 284. Finkelstein J at 287 there cited with approval the following propositions formulated by Hill J in Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd [1993] FCA 585 ; (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201 (citations omitted): These cases seem to me to support the following propositions being made. (1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order ... (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits, for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine for itself the case on the merits or, as it might be put, to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial ... This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them ... (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation ... (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted, the Court may take into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted ... The third proposition formulated by Hill J has, however, attracted repeated comment &#8212; both in this Court and in State courts. Thus, for instance, in Gribbles, Finkelstein J observed at 287: For my own part I should wish to emphasise that in the absence of a hearing on the merits it is difficult to see how any order, other than an order that each party bear its own costs, can be made except in special circumstances. To do otherwise would require some prediction of the outcome of the case. It seems to me that the third proposition stated by Hill J was intended to cover the situation where the Court was in fact able to form a clear view about the merits of a case without a trial. So, if a claim is patently hopeless that would be a good reason to make an order for costs against the claimant. Likewise if a defence was bound to fail that would be good reason for awarding costs in favour of the claimant. But I venture to suggest that there will be very few cases where the issues will be sufficiently clear, in the absence of a hearing, for an order for costs to be made in favour of a party. And in Boscaini v Corporation of Kensington and Norwood [1999] SASC 327 , Debelle J observed: [22] I immediately acknowledge the assistance of Hill J but suggest that proposition (3) is of limited assistance. The fact that a party has not conducted himself reasonably may disentitle him to costs. But, beyond that, the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties is not likely to assist in determining whether the applicant should recover his costs. The real question is whether the applicant had reasonable prospects of success. It seems preferable, therefore, to express proposition (3) in different terms. Depending on circumstances, where the applicant has acted reasonably in commencing proceedings, has an arguable case, and it is reasonable to conclude that the respondent has acted in consequence of the commencement of proceedings, the court may be prepared to make an order as to costs in favour of the applicant. Both of these observations were most recently addressed by Lander J in Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Ltd v Hardel Investments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 399 at [353] to [354], 176 FCR 348 at 364. His Honour said at [359], 176 FCR at 364: ... I disagree with respect with Debelle J's decision in Boscaini ... A party may behave so unreasonably in the bringing or conducting of proceedings so that an order for costs against that party is required in the interests of justice without ever deciding whether the party had a good cause of action.

Case21148,referred to,De Rose v South Australia [2002] FCA 1342,"The following observations were made by the trial judge concerning airstrips and roads in De Rose v South Australia [2002] FCA 1342 (at [558]), the proceedings culminating in De Rose (No 2) : ...I do not see how improvements such as fences and roads would wholly, or even partially, extinguish native title; they are clear examples of improvements which are capable of joint use. Airstrips represent a particular problem because of issues of safety. Because of that factor, I would deny the claimants all rights of access with a buffer zone of 500 metres. In respect of airstrips and their buffer zones, native title has been extinguished. 159 This reasoning must, of course, be tested against the approach determined by the Full Court in the appeal from that judgment. It is doubtless true that many of the native title rights arising in this matter (except, perhaps, the right to live and camp including to erect shelters) can be exercised on land on which an airstrip or road has been constructed. While it is possible that the exercise of those rights might conflict with the use of an airstrip or road (for example, hunting on the airstrip or road when a plane is landing or vehicle passing by), it could reasonably be expected that such circumstances would be rare. However, as I apprehend the reasons of the Full Court in De Rose (No 2) , based, as they were, on High Court authority, it is important to focus ultimately on the competing and potentially inconsistent rights of pastoralists (and their exercise) and native title right holders and not merely on whether land can be used simultaneously by both in exercise of those rights. 160 If I was satisfied on the evidence that the trap yard airstrips and pastoral roads were constructed, in the sense discussed by the Full Court in De Rose (No 2) , in exercise of rights conferred by the leases, then it would appear to follow from the reasons of the Full Court, that their construction in exercise of those rights probably extinguished all native title rights on the land on which they were constructed. However, the evidence to which I was referred does not enable me to conclude that there was such construction. If it be the fact (and this is not established one way or the other by this evidence) that the trap yard airstrips were nothing more than naturally flat land cleared of vegetation and the roads were nothing more than navigable land over which vehicles have continuously driven, then probably neither could be said to have been constructed. If it be the fact (and this is not established one way or the other by this evidence) that either the trap yard airstrips or the pastoral roads (or some of them) had been graded and formed then it may be possible to say they have been constructed in exercise of rights conferred by the lease. Given the paucity of the evidence I am unable to conclude that native title rights have been extinguished on land on which trap yard airstrips and pastoral roads presently exist on the claim area. 161 The next issue concerns land adjacent to the improvements. The applicants conceded that where native title had been extinguished on land due to the construction of an improvement on that land, native title would also be extinguished on adjacent land, the exclusive use of which was necessary for the enjoyment of the improvement. The applicants proposed a regime, to be incorporated in the determination, which involved identifying the land adjacent to improvements in general terms and the creation of a liberty to apply: to establish the precise location of the boundaries of land on which the improvements referred to at Schedule D to this determination have been constructed and any adjacent land or waters the exclusive use of which is necessary for the enjoyment of the improvements. 162 The Pastoralists contended that such an order should be expressed consistently with [166] of De Rose (No 2) , not by reference to ""exclusive use"", and similarly, that the reference to the buffer zone or adjacent areas in the determination should be expressed in the same way. Where the evidence permitted a finding about the adjacent area needed to permit enjoyment of the improvement, the Pastoralists submitted that that should be reflected in the determination though they appeared to accept that, as an alternative, findings could be made in the reasons for judgment identifying the adjacent area in relation to those improvements addressed by the evidence."
Case787,cited,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24,"An administrative decision may be impugned if the decision maker was bound to take a factor into account in reaching his or her decision but failed to do so. If a statute states expressly the factors that must be taken into account, that will be decisive. However, if the relevant factors are not expressly stated, they must be determined by necessary implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the [1986] HCA 40 ; Act ( Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40). 41 In the present case, s 29A(2) sets out factors that an Examiner must consider when determining whether a notation must or may be included in a notice. The matters that must be taken into consideration are: &#8226; the safety or reputation of a person; &#8226; the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence; &#8226; the effectiveness of an operation or investigation. 42 Further, the scheme of ss 29A and 29B recognises the existence of legal professional privilege in so far as the prohibition on disclosure does not prevent a person from making disclosure to a legal practitioner or, if the person is a legal practitioner, for the purpose of obtaining instructions as to the production of a document. 43 Under s 30(3) a legal practitioner may refuse to comply with a requirement to produce a document containing a privileged communication unless the person with whom the communication was made agrees to the practitioner complying with the requirement. The subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act make it abundantly clear that an Examiner who is deciding whether or not to issue a notice and whether to include a notation in the notice is not required to have regard to the possibility that the recipient of the notice may not discharge that recipient's obligation to assert or claim legal professional privilege that may reside in a person other than the recipient in relation to the document that the recipient is required to produce. 44 That is the clear intent and purpose of ss 29A and 29B. However, the clear object of ss 29A and 29B is to ensure that, in some circumstances, the object of an investigation, such as persons in the position of the applicants, is not informed of the existence of a notice. The relevant Examiners did not fail to take into account a consideration that they were bound to take into account simply by reason of the fact that they did not have regard to the possibility that documents that were required to be produced by a notice might be the subject of legal professional privilege of a person other than the recipient."
Case14417,discussed,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63,"425(1) obliges the Tribunal to invite the applicant to appear to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. The nature and extent of that obligation, in the sense of the Tribunal putting the applicant on notice as to the matters he should address at the hearing, was discussed by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 at [35] , [36] and [47]. In particular, at [36] the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ) said: Ordinarily then, as was the case here, the Tribunal will begin its interview of an applicant who has accepted the Tribunal's invitation to appear, knowing that it is not persuaded by the material already before it to decide the review in the applicant's favour. That lack of persuasion may be based on particular questions the Tribunal has about specific aspects of the material already before it; it may be based on nothing more particular than a general unease about the veracity of what is revealed in that material. But unless the Tribunal tells the applicant something different, the applicant would be entitled to assume that the reasons given by the delegate for refusing to grant the application will identify the issues that arise in relation to that decision. It is appropriate, where there has been a remittal of an earlier decision of the Tribunal, to apply that observation to the reasons given by the Tribunal as earlier constituted, provided of course that the reasons for that decision being quashed do not negate the relevant earlier reasons. The problem here, however, is not that the Tribunal did not ask the applicant to expand on those aspects of his claim based upon his asserted political beliefs which would lead him not to undertake further military service and to explain why that account should be accepted. The problem here, as I have found, is simply that the Tribunal appears not to have recognised that the applicant did expand on that aspect of his claim as it did not then consider whether to accept his evidence or to consider its consequences. In my view, the Tribunal's error was not in failing to fulfil the requirements of s 425. It is a different one. For those reasons, I direct that the decision of the Tribunal given on 7 July 2008 be quashed, and the matter constituting the review instigated by application made on 25 May 2007 be remitted to the Tribunal again for consideration according to law. The Minister should pay to the applicant his costs of the application.

It is important to keep in mind that it is an investigative power which is under consideration in these proceedings. As stated by the Full Court in Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd [1980] FCA 94 ; 47 FLR 163 (at 174): The investigative power may properly be exercised by inquiring into the existence of facts which do not themselves constitute a contravention or deny the possibility of a contravention. The power may properly be exercised to ascertain facts which may merely indicate a further line of inquiry, or which may tend to prove circumstances from which an inference can be drawn as to the existence of other facts which have a more immediate and proximate relationship to the matter under investigation. The applicants are involved in international activities, and decisions and discussions concerning the matter under investigation may readily be accepted as having occurred overseas, as well as in Australia. The conduct of the applicants wherever occurring could be relevant to the investigation of the matter as defined in the Notices. It is not for this Court to confine or restrict the course of an investigation if the powers conferred by s 155 have not been exceeded. In relation to the interpretation of the Notices, the applicants allege that the definition of 'Fuel Surcharge' is wide and unclear. However, to the extent that the applicants have responded to the Notices, they appear to have had no difficulty at all in understanding the meaning of the term. It seems to me that the applicants should be, and in fact are, well versed in the concept of 'Fuel Surcharge'."

Case19509,cited,Enzed Holdings Limited v Wynthea Pty Limited (1984) 57 ALR 167,"In those circumstances, s 77(2) provides that it is not an infringement of the copyright in the artistic work to reproduce the work on or after the relevant date by applying the corresponding design or any other corresponding design to an article. A corresponding design in simple terms is a design which has a relevant correspondence with the artistic work. A 'corresponding design' in relation to an artistic work, in precise terms, means a 'design' that when 'applied' to an 'article' results in a 'reproduction' of that work (leaving aside the exclusion in the concluding words of the definition (s 74)). 219 The term 'design' is not defined in the Copyright Act but it is a central conception of the Designs Act 1906 (Cth). There it is defined to mean 'features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation applicable to an article, being features that, in the finished article, can be judged by the eye, but does not include a method or principle of construction' (s 4). 220 Sections 74 to 77 of the Copyright Act seek to provide a solution to the overlap between the bundle of exclusive rights comprising the copyright in an artistic work (and their duration) and the perceived need for limitations upon those rights in respect of a design inherent in the artistic work applied industrially in the manufacture of articles which exhibit, to the eye, those design features. Since the scope and duration of rights in such a design, if registered, is comparatively constrained by the Designs Act 1906, ss 74 and 77 of the Copyright Act seek to constrain the reach of the copyright in the artistic work so that no copyright infringement arises if the challenged conduct is the application of the design to a particular article that results in a reproduction of the artistic work even though the copyright owner's design was not registered nor registrable. 295 However, that sum does not represent a reasonable or fair estimate of the compensatory loss actually suffered by the applicant because it represents a construct based on the particular assumption. The court must do its best to quantify the actual loss even if some degree of speculation or even possible guess work is involved in this exercise ( Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited v DAP Services [2007] FCAFC 40 per Black CJ and Jacobson). The court is not relieved from the duty of assessing the loss merely because circumstances do not admit of damages being assessed with certainty ( McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission [1950] HCA 12 ; (1951) 84 CLR 377 at 412 per Dixon and Fullagar JJ; Enzed Holdings Limited v Wynthea Pty Limited (1984) 57 ALR 167 at p 183 per Sheppard, Morling and Wilcox JJ where their Honours said, 'The principle is clear. If the court finds damage has occurred it must do its best to quantify the loss even if a degree of speculation and guess work is involved. Furthermore, if actual damage is suffered, the award must be for more than nominal damages' . See also The Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 54 ; (1992) 174 CLR 64 at 83 per Mason CJ and Dawson J, where their Honours said, 'The settled rule, both here and in England, is that mere difficulty in estimating damages does not relieve a court from the responsibility of estimating them as best it can' )."
Case4001,cited,Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd [2006] HCA Trans 223,"matter is complicated by the number of related claims and appeals. In summary: 1. The genesis of this matter was proceedings commenced by the appellant against the respondents in the Federal Court of Australia in November 2003. The appellant claimed contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) in respect of the respondents' alleged refusal to honour a promotional card sold to the appellant by the Queensland University of Technology Association of Law Students. Those proceedings were heard and summarily dismissed by Cooper J on 24 May 2004 ( Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 642). His Honour ordered that the appellant pay the respondents' costs of and incidental to the proceedings. 2. On 20 September 2004, an estimate of the respondents' bill of costs arising out of the decision of Cooper J was made pursuant to the provisions of O 62 r 46 Federal Court Rules and allowed in the sum of $24 000.00, for which sum a Certificate of Taxation was issued on 12 October 2004. 3. On 26 November 2004 Deputy District Registrar Baldwin in the Federal Court made an order that the appellant pay the sum of $24 000.00 to the respondents. 4. Bankruptcy Notice Q/N1238/2004 ('the bankruptcy notice') identifying the appellant as the debtor was issued by the Official Receiver on 15 December 2004. The bankruptcy notice was issued in relation to the appellant's failure to pay the respondents in accordance with the costs order of Deputy District Registrar Baldwin of 26 November 2004. 5. On 21 January 2005 the respondents served the bankruptcy notice on the appellant. 6. On 13 May 2005 before Deputy District Registrar Baldwin in the Federal Court the appellant sought to have the bankruptcy notice set aside. The appellant was unsuccessful and he was ordered to pay costs in the amount of $2500. The appellant unsuccessfully appealed this decision of the Deputy District Registrar ( Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd ACN 090 830 854, in the matter of Worchild [2005] FCA 863 per Dowsett J), and then again unsuccessfully to the Full Court of the Federal Court ( Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 240). As at the date of the hearing the appellant had sought special leave to appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Full Court. (I understand that special leave to appeal was refused: Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd [2006] HCA Trans 223.) 7. On 3 June 2005, the respondents filed a creditor's petition in the Federal Magistrates Court applying for a sequestration order under s 43 Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (' Bankruptcy Act ') against the estate of the appellant in respect of the debt of $24 000.00 owing to them under the order of Deputy District Registrar Baldwin in the Federal Court of 26 November 2004. The document was accompanied by an affidavit of the second respondent sworn 31 May 2005, deposing that he had access to the books and records of the first respondent, and that the appellant had not paid, nor made arrangements to the satisfaction of the respondents for the settlement of the debt claimed in the bankruptcy notice. 8. On 20 June 2005 the appellant filed and served a Notice of Intention to Oppose the Petition in the Federal Magistrates Court. 9. The petition came before District Registrar Ramsey in the Federal Magistrates Court on 24 June 2005, however the Registrar directed that the matter be adjourned for hearing before a Federal Magistrate at 10.15 am on 26 August 2005. The matter then came before Rimmer FM."
Case10793,cited,Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1,"am bound to follow matters of principle enunciated by the Full Court. In that regard, it may be, as Buchanan J highlights in the following passage from his judgment in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 at 597, [22] , that there is a difference in opinion at intermediate appellate level as to whether, for the purpose of satisfying a condition precedent to the awarding of indemnity costs and as an alternative to ""imprudent"", the rejection of an offer of compromise should be able to be described as ""unreasonable"" or ""plainly unreasonable"": In Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 ( Dukemaster) Sundberg and Emmett JJ said, in a case like the present where O 23 r 11 did not apply because an applicant had been wholly unsuccessful, that an applicant for a more generous award of costs than party-party costs 'must show that the rejection of the offer was imprudent or plainly unreasonable' (see at [7]). There has been doubt expressed about the soundness of the statement in Dukemaster that rejection of an offer, if unreasonable, must be 'plainly unreasonable' in the light of the earlier judgment of a Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] [218], to which Wilcox J also referred in Coshott (see Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 at [59] [62]). In the earlier of the Full Court authorities, Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at 432-433, [218] , the point was made that the conduct of an offeree need not be ""plainly unreasonable"" in order to warrant the ordering of indemnity costs because ""To adopt an especially high standard of unreasonableness would operate as a fetter on the discretion to award indemnity costs and diminish the effectiveness of the Calderbank offer as an incentive to settlement."" I respectfully agree and, for that reason, would choose to follow the earlier Full Court authority were that to be critical to the resolution of the costs application. It is not though because in both Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 and Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 the alternative of imprudent rejection was acknowledged. Like Buchanan J in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) and, as his Honour noted (at [22]), like Heerey J in AFP Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [24] [25], it is sufficient to assess whether the rejection of any of the offers was, ""imprudent"". That basis of assessment accords with the exemplar given by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited , which I have already noted, whose judgment, as Heerey J acknowledged in AFP Properties (ibid), is the locus classicus on the subject."
Case7237,referred to,Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd (in liq) v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 53 NSWLR 213,"The cash flow test of insolvency focuses on the liquidity of a business. A balance sheet test of solvency, addressing the excess of assets over liabilities, may include assets which are not readily realisable so as to permit the payment of all debts as and when they fall due. On the other hand, insolvency means more than a mere temporary lack of liquidity but, as counsel for the liquidators put it, involves ""an endemic inability to pay debts as and when they become payable"": see eg Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 ; Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd (in liq) v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 53 NSWLR 213 at [54]. 44 In considering the evidence on those issues, it is appropriate to have regard both to the contractual terms for payment of debts to suppliers, generally according to invoices 30 days, and to the attitude of the suppliers over time provided the time is lengthy enough to delayed payment of debts, as that may demonstrate some other arrangement between them and the debtor. I do not think that approach is inconsistent with the views of Palmer J in Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 53 NSWLR 213 at [54]. Nor do I think the creditor's emphasis on the ""commercial realities"" of the relationship between the company and its creditors is misplaced. What the arrangement was between Damilock and its creditors is a question of fact: see eg Iso Lilodw'Aliphumeleli Pty Ltd (in liq) v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 42 ACSR 561 ; Re New World Alliance Pty Ltd (receivers and managers appointed) ; Sycotex Pty Ltd v Baseler (No 2) (1994) 51 FCR 425 ; and Taylor v Carroll (1991) 6 ACSR 255."

Case15492,cited,Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 56 ALD 321,"The Tribunal then referred to s 501 , saying: ""The Minister may cancel a visa if the holder does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test."" That statement is also unexceptionable. The question, however, is whether the Tribunal did, in fact, approach the exercise of discretion from the right direction. Doubt is cast on that matter by that part of the Tribunal's reasons in which it deals with the application of the law and findings of fact. The Tribunal repeats that the first issue for it to decide is whether, pursuant to ss 501(6)(a) and 501 (7), the applicant passes the character test, having regard to his substantial criminal record. The Tribunal observes, citing authority of the Full Federal Court, that the character test requires an objective consideration of the applicant's enduring moral qualities, but that that does not require the applicant to meet the highest standards of integrity. This issue is whether any deficiencies in his character are such that it is in the public good to refuse the visa (see Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 56 ALD 321 at [8] and [24]). The Tribunal then went on to say that, on the other hand, despite the many good qualities possessed by a person, those qualities can be outweighed by a single adverse incident if it is of sufficient weight and seriousness. 25 The Tribunal then purports to state the second stage of its decision-making process, and says, relevantly, as follows: ""Secondly, I am required to have regard to Part 1 of Direction 21 as a guide to the application of the character test. If I decide that the applicant does not pass the character test, I must consider whether to exercise the discretion in s 501(1) not to cancel the applicant's visa, notwithstanding that the applicant does not pass the character test. In so doing, I must have regard to Part 2 of Direction No 21 as a guide to the exercise of its discretion."" 26 The Tribunal then observed that the applicant in the present case failed the character test because of his substantial criminal record, and observed that there were no mitigating circumstances, but that, on the contrary, the record was aggravated by the presence of offences committed while on bail. The Tribunal then said: ""I must therefore consider whether to exercise my discretion under 501(2) to decide, nevertheless, whether not to cancel the applicant's visa. In exercising that discretion, the Tribunal has regard to Part 2 of Direction No 21. Paragraph 2.2 provides that a decision-maker should have regard to three primary considerations and a number of other considerations."" 27 The Tribunal then went on to deal in some detail with each of the primary considerations that are set out in Direction No 21. After dealing with protection of the Australian community, the Tribunal said: ""To set aside the decision under review in the case of an unrehabilitated offender with such a serious record during his eight years in Australia would, in my view, send entirely the wrong message to other non-citizens contemplating criminal behaviour."" 28 At the end of the section dealing with the expectations of the Australian community the Tribunal said: ""The community would be likely to take the view that there is a limit to how far further chances can be offered to a repeat offender, and the applicant has crossed it. Community expectations would clearly favour visa cancellation in this case."" 29 The third primary consideration, the best interests of the child, has no relevance in the present case. After having regard to the other considerations that are specified in Direction No 21, the Tribunal concluded as follows: ""The primary considerations of community protection and expectations outweigh the other considerations in this case. The decision under review is affirmed."""
Case8733,distinguished,Baidakova v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1436,"Fundamental to the Tribunal's decision was its understanding that the relevant test of ""substantial compliance"" was as discussed in Baidakova v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1436 at 6. The Tribunal applied the ""substantial compliance"" test to Condition 8202(3)(b). However, the requirement in Condition 8202(3)(b) to provide a certificate cannot, logically, be satisfied by substantial compliance. Either Condition 8202(3)(b) is satisfied or it is not; either there is a certificate of an ""at least satisfactory"" academic result or there is not ( Jayasekara v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 167 ; (2006) 156 FCR 199 per Heerey and Sundberg JJ). It is not in dispute that the education provider, the University of Sydney ('the University') had not provided the necessary certificate. There was no compliance with Condition 8202(3)(b). There is ' no scope for operation of the distinction between strict compliance and substantial compliance ' in determining whether Item 8202(3)(b) of Sch 8 of the Regulations is satisfied ( Weerasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 261 at [10] , cited in Jayasekara at [5])."
Case6352,cited,BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (2007) 162 FCR 234,"The provisions of Pt IIIA are complex and have given rise to difficulty. For example, judges of this Court have differed as to the meaning of the term ""the use of a production process"" in s 44B. Recently, in BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (2007) 162 FCR 234 , a Full Court, by majority, disapproved Kenny J's reasoning in First Hamersley Iron. In March this year, the High Court granted special leave to appeal from that decision of the Full Court. 16 It is well established that the doctrine of res judicata will apply whether or not the decision which is said to give rise to that form of estoppel has itself been overruled. It makes no difference whether the initial judgment was wrong. It follows that I need not concern myself with whether First Hamersley Iron represents good law. The only question is whether it operates in the way for which Hamersley contends. 17 In considering whether First Hamersley Iron operates to prevent the NCC from dealing with the TPI application , it is of course necessary to pay close attention to the issues determined in that case. 18 The facts may be briefly stated. In September 1998 Robe River applied to the NCC under s 44F(1) to recommend that the designated Minister declare the Hamersley rail track to be a ""service"". The application identified Hamersley as the provider of the service and the owner of the facility to which it related. 19 The Robe River application went on to state as follows: ""3.2 The service to which [Robe] seeks access is the bulk iron ore rail track transportation service provided by the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility, as defined in part 4 of this application ( Rail Track Service ). This should be distinguished from any rail haulage service which may be available in relation to this facility. 3.3 The Rail Track Service is required for use by both [Robe] trains and by [Robe] hi-rails only over that section of the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility described in part 4 of this application. The Rail Track Service comprises the use of an infrastructure facility, being the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility mainline, yard track and maintenance support road, including the in-track fault detection and monitoring systems, and the use of a communications service being the train control systems, inclusive of two-way radio. 3.4 The access sought by [Robe] is the use of the Rail Track Service by [Robe] trains laden with iron ore from [Robe's] West Angelas minesite, travelling from the minesite to [Robe's] Port Walcott at Cape Lambert, and by empty [Robe] trains on a return journey to the minesite. ... 3.6 [Robe] is not seeking the service provided by the [Hamersley] locomotives, rolling stock or hi-rails. [Robe] will provide its own locomotives, rolling stock, hi-rails and all necessary operational personnel. [Hi-rails are road motor vehicles capable of being driven on rail tracks and are used for maintenance purposes] """
Case20485,referred to,Brookfield Multiplex Limited v International Litigation Funding Partners PTE Ltd [2008] FCA 1769,"any event, the Commission submits that the question of discretion is not the overriding consideration in the grant of leave to serve outside the jurisdiction. It relies on what was said by Finkelstein J in Brookfield Multiplex Limited v International Litigation Funding Partners PTE Ltd [2008] FCA 1769 at [7] to the effect that, if the conditions provided for in O 8 r 3 are satisfied, it usually follows that leave to serve outside the jurisdiction will be granted. As it was put by Black CJ and Finkelstein J in Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd [2006] FCAFC 116 ; (2006) 154 FCR 425 at [3] , if the required conditions for leave are fulfilled, leave should be given in the absence of some countervailing consideration. Their Honours said at [10] that, provided the jurisdiction of the Court is engaged by an action in respect of subject matter with which the Court can deal, the action is instituted by an applicant who has standing, the action is not oppressive, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process and the Court can assume jurisdiction over the defendant, the Court cannot refuse to adjudicate the dispute. Their Honours continued at [11] to express the opinion that it would be ' curious and anomalous if matters that could not be raised in answer to the appellant's claim by a defendant served within the jurisdiction could nevertheless be taken into account when deciding whether to allow service out of the jurisdiction '."
Case6717,referred to,"Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466","140(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (the Evidence Act ) prescribes the standard of proof in a civil proceeding as the balance of probabilities, and s 140(2) provides that the Court may take into account, in deciding whether it is so satisfied, the nature of the cause of action or defence, the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding and the gravity of the matters alleged. In Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 the Full Court noted at [31] that Dixon J's classic discussion in Briginshaw appositely expresses the considerations which s 140(2) of the Evidence Act now requires a court to take into account. In conclusion, the standard of proof that I must apply is the balance of probabilities as prescribed by s 1332, and I accept that in deciding whether ASIC's allegations are made out on the balance of probabilities I am required to take into account the causes of action and the gravity of the matters alleged and their consequences: s 140(2) Evidence Act ; Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; 60 CLR 336. If inferences are to be drawn, ASIC has to establish that the circumstances appearing from the evidence give rise to a reasonable and definite inference and not merely to conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Macdonald (No 11) [2009] NSWSC 287 ; (2009) 256 ALR 199 at [186] ; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; 162 FCR 466 at [38] . In Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 , the Court discussed the Adler and Rich cases and concluded at [76] that there is no reason in civil proceedings for pecuniary penalties to deny the applicability of the principles in Jones v Dunkel provided that in doing so the court proceeds in accordance with the principles in relation to s 140 of the Evidence Act , which prescribes he civil standard as the applicable standard of proof. I have discussed the standard of proof earlier."
Case3375,applied,Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 73 ; (1953) 91 CLR 592,"inspiration for Karam's position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 ; (2003) AIPC 91-839. That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s 195(2) for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks. Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld. In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal, the Court said as follows (at [17] [19]): 'No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s 56 of the Act. The presence of s 195(2) suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act 1990 (Cth). On that basis, on appeal under s 56 , the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered. Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition. The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding . An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails. In an expungement proceeding, the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored. That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding. Thus, it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court, first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then, subsequently, if the opposition proceeding failed, in an expungement proceeding. Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court, before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s 195(2) of the Act, to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct.' [emphasis added] In the course of the substantive decision the Court said (at [36]): 'The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on. In the present context, that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date, at least on the balance of probabilities. On one view, they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para [17] above.' In the event, however, the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities, although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis ([45]). Emmett J was one of the members of the Court. It is to be noted that the point had not been argued, and that the obiter dicta was tentative. 10 F Hoffman-La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc [2000] FCA 283 ; (2000) 99 FCR 56 involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act 1952 (Cth). Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals. His consideration of the legislation led him to say (at [47]): '...pre-grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity. The purpose of pre-grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post-grant litigation; that is, to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant (see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin-Amgen Inc [1999] FCA 742 ; (1999) 92 FCR 106 at 112 [19] ; [1999] FCA 742 ; 163 ALR 761 at 766 767 [19]). It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register (see McGlashan v Rabett [1909] HCA 85 ; (1909) 9 CLR 223 at 229.' [emphasis added] He then considered the authorities and concluded (at [67]): '... it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid. I consider that, before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent, the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent , if granted, would not be valid . That, however, is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence-in-chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate, with the requisite degree of clarity, that a patent, if granted, would not be valid.' [emphasis added] Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive. Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 132 FCR 326. Again, the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions. Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman-La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) to trade marks opposition proceedings. Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation (July 1992), paragraph 1.3.4. Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman-La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCA 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 at 371 372 where it referred to the 'presumption of registrability' under the 1995 Act. As I have pointed out, the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature. In the substantive decision by Bennett J, the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus. The reference to onus in par [129] seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground. Neither of the two authorities cited-- Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1953) 91 CLR 592--refer to any special onus. In the last sentence of par [130] Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the 'clearly not be registered' basis. Not long afterwards, I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; (2003) 61 IPR 130; (2004) AIPC 91-957. I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s 55 could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view. I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis. Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson [2004] FCA 1247 ; (2004) 63 IPR 582; (2004) AIPC 92-033. After citing Torpedoes and Lomas , but not Clinique, Kenny J said (at [24]): 'The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out.' That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case. In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus. Shortly after that, Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd (2004) 212 ALR 79; (2004) 62 IPR 545; (2004) AIPC 92-036. His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on (at [8]): 'My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks [1998] FCA 440 ; (1998) 83 FCR 50, 56 but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 at para [17] - [19] , [23] and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318 , 321 322 . The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and, in any event, may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law.' In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio (Australia) Pty Ltd (2004) 209 ALR 93; (2004) 61 IPR 257; (2004) AIPC 92-016 Finn J followed Torpedoes 'as a matter of comity'. There was no reference to Clinique. In Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 5 ; (2005) 64 IPR 495; (2005) AIPC 92-059, Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J's analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes, however, as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities, it was not necessary to apply the higher standard. Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon (2005) 223 ALR 27; (2005) 66 IPR 131; (2005) AIPC 92-131. Having referred to them, his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows (at [137] [141]): 'I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point. However, there is authority of the Full Court directly on point. I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous. French J said that there is a presumption of registrability; that Jafferjee no longer is relevant; that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar; that because of the obligation imposed by s 33 the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it; and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out. Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered. I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas, and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court. Therefore, I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered.' With all respect, neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue. It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas . Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to 'clearly' establish a ground of opposition. In Woolworths v BP plc [2006] FCAFC 52 ; (2006) 150 FCR 134 (an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier), Sundberg and Bennett JJ said (at [80] [84]): 'In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act 1990 ( Cth) and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered. In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at [17] that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s 56 of the Act. In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 132 FCR 326, Bennett J followed Lomas . In that case, neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions. Other judges have followed Torpedoes . Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition. In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 Lander J at [118] [141] considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court. Despite his Honour's own reservations, he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas. The authors of Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks &amp; Passing Off (3rd ed, 2003) also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act . They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court's approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent. It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties, if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established.' In the events which happened, the question was not determined in the substantive appeal ( Woolworths Ltd v BP plc [2006] FCAFC 132). I observe that Branson J (one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd ) applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video (S) Pte Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 17; (2005) AIPC 92-129; [2005] FCA 1126 , although apparently in the absence of argument (see, particularly, par [29]). The fundamental difficulty with Karam's argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s 55. Whether a ground of opposition has been 'established' is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation. In my opinion, there is no basis upon which the section can be read as 'the extent (if any) to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established', particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof. It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all. The precise finding in that case was that the opposition 'should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered' (at [22]). With all respect, that test is not to be found in the statute. I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the 1995 Act that would point to reading s 55 other than according to its ordinary meaning. In my opinion, it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material. In any event, the extrinsic material does not support Karam's argument. The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd (at [128] [136]) adequately discloses the difficulty. Furthermore, it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents 'where appropriate' was effected, so far as was regarded as appropriate, by the 1995 Act and Regulations made under the 1995 Act. In my opinion, borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible, to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J. Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history. A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each. It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman-La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report. It was novel when handed down in 2000, long after the 1995 Act had been enacted, and is still controversial. It is also anomalous that, when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div 2 of Pt 8 of the 1995 Act on grounds similar to those involved here, there is no hint of the application of any special onus, although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered. An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis. Further, as I said in Clinique (at [13]): 'It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark, including appeal to the Court, causing considerable expense and delay and, even if unsuccessful, then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings. It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus (cf Miller v University of New South Wales (2003) 200 ALR 565 ). The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well-resourced commercial opponent is obvious.' There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition, whether before the Registrar or on appeal, is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion. Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s 56, the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition. A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition. The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate ( Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at [33]). Where, as in this case, the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment, it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny. I am faced with the clear words of the statute, on one hand, and the opinions of various judges, on the other. There is no binding Full Court authority. I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard. In my opinion, in this case, comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute. 'The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute' per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 19 ; (1987) 163 CLR 1; cited with approval by Mason CJ, Wilson, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1989] HCA 5 ; (1989) 166 CLR 417 at 439. I will, therefore, approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition, although not clearly establish such a ground, whether in a summary fashion or otherwise. GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss 43, 44 and 60. There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them. What is the difference between s 44 and s 60? In the present case, the marks are not substantially identical, therefore, the issue is deceptive similarity. Section 60 depends upon the opponent's mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them. Section 44(1) refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant's mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods. In other words, the comparison is between mark and mark, not between mark and reputation. Where does s 43 fit it in? The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion. There is a plethora of authority concerning s 44 and s 60. There is little authority as to s 43. EVIDENCE Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein, an in-house lawyer, to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover, an in-house lawyer, regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia. Silverstein dealt with the history, advertising and promotion of the product, advertising expenditure, sales of the product, trade mark registrations and, in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA, attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers, magazines and medical publications. Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA, advertising of the product in Australia, the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia, Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA. A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research, radio transcripts, media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet. Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class 5 for a mark containing the '-AGRA' suffix. The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction, both in Australia and internationally. 'VIAGRA' is an invented word. The product was launched in Australia in September 1998. The delegate, having considered that material, was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation, both literally and for the purposes of the 1995 Act. I can only agree. Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such. However, it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies. It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally, including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies. Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation. The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark 'VIAGRA' is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction. I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way. Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah-Jane Armstrong, who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX, PANADOL, DISPRIN, ASPALGIN, NUROFEN, PANAFEN, CODOX, CODIS and CODALGIN. Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein, a market research consultant. He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions: ' ""In light of the documents and material provided to you and/or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following: As at 23 December 2002 was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia: (a) an association with Pfizer; or (b) that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source."" Section 44 of the Trade Marks Act ""The determination to be made under section 44 is between the marks as registered or applied for, assuming a notional use of both, that is, a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration/application being considered. The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure ""A"". Please provide your expert opinion on the following: As at 23 December 2002 was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia: (a) an association with Pfizer; or (b) that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source"".' The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and, secondly, upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products. That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result. I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (2006) 228 ALR 719. I said I would give reasons in this judgment. On reflection, it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved, to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J. As I was not, and am not, of the view that his decision was clearly wrong, it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue. In the present case, there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and, even if it were, it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another. Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account, partially based on hearsay, of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) and the administration of the system provided by it. That attempt was not persisted in. I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine, once listed, can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution. The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions. SECTION 60 In my opinion, a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health, vitality and sexuality marketed under the name 'HERBAGRA' to be a herbal version of VIAGRA, whether or not from the same source, or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA. In my opinion, there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result. It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important, having in mind the products and the cause of trade. The words do not look alike. Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA. Reference was made to CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd (2000) 52 IPR 42; (2000) AIPC 91-640; (2001) ATPR 41-793; [2000] FCA 1539 at [52] ; Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited [1952] HCA 15 ; (1952) 86 CLR 536 at 538; Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd (No 2) (1994) 29 IPR 485 at 493; (1994) AIPC 91-096; Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd [1943] 1 All ER 400; (1943) 60 RPC 87 at 108. It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties, although there may be a sub-market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance. The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life. A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and/or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties. Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range. It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and, therefore, will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem. The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies, such as health foods stores, chemists and supermarkets. It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a 'natural' cure for their erectile problem or a non-pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance. Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that, when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered, as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks, there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense. It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix '-AGRA' would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix. Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance ( Cooper Engineering at 538 539). In my opinion, these submissions under-estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix '-AGRA'. It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as 'AGRA' has no relevant meaning. To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight, even if the sound is, as it were, heard silently. In any event, the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale, ordering the product for sale, and so on. ( Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc [1973] HCA 43 ; (1973) 129 CLR 353 at 362.) I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks. It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA. The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase ( Hack, Re Application to Register a Trade Mark (1940) 58 RPC 91 at 103 104; Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at 595 596 ; Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another [2000] HCA 12 ; (1999) 202 CLR 45 at [83] ). In my view, many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription. Even if they did, there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug. The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word 'AGRA' is of little substance. It is an invented word with no meaning in this context. To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara, or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant. It is not descriptive in any relevant sense. A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA. That was a, perhaps the, reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point. The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t/as Tabasco Design (1997) 149 ALR 496; (1997) 39 IPR 187. That was a s 52 and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word 'Tabasco' (associated with a pepper sauce) in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands. His Honour said (at (1997) 149 ALR 508): 'It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand ""Dunhill"", associated with an ""upmarket"" cigarette, starts to appear on an expanding range of other--and different--""upmarket"" goods (and even then, the expert evidence suggested, one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association, when one first saw that occurring); it is another, as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer, to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name ""Tabasco"" has a commercial association with the well-known sauce of that name. The far more likely conclusion is, I think, that, without any association or permission the designer has--as the fact is--perhaps cheekily used a name which, by reference to its only other known use, conjures up ""hot"" associations.' Two points should be made. First, the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s 52 or passing off is different from that arising under s 60. Secondly, the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here. It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA's reputation. Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at (1997) 149 ALR 504 505; (1997) 39 IPR 195 196. In my opinion, such persons would not be representative of the public at large. Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases, such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641; Cooper Engineering; The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Limited [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407 and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the 1995 Act provided that onus is borne in mind (cf Coca-Cola Company v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 ; (1999) 96 FCR 107 at [39] [42]), I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA, which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA, and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion. For the sake of completeness I should add that, although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result, in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam, I could not find that the elements of s 60 were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required. SECTION 44 I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought, certainly in relation to registration No 864135. If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s 44, then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s 60 that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion (s 10). It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but, in my view, the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception. I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s 44. The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past ( Berlei Hestia per Mason J at 362; MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd (1998) 90 FCR 236 at 245 246). Section 60 brings in reputation. I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at [61] is sufficient to alter the test for s 44. There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement ( CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at [51]; Caterpillar Loader Hire (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co (1983) 48 ALR 511; (1983) 1 IPR 265; (1983) 77 FLR 139 per Lockhart J at 151, Franki J at 141 and Neaves J at 163). It is not clear that, if correct, this is to be imported into s 44 (cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video (S) ). If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA, the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation. Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source, but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient. The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes. If reputation were not taken into account, I would not be satisfied that Pfizer's mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA. I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so. SECTION 43 Section 43 does not have a long pedigree. It was enacted pursuant to Australia's obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). TRIPS and the 1992 Working Party Report led to a 1994 Bill containing the following cl 42(2): 'An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding: (a) the nature, quality, origin, intended purpose, or some other characteristic, of the goods or services; or (b) any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person.' That Bill was enacted but never came into force. In the 1995 Bill (and Act) cl 42(2) of the 1994 Bill was replaced by what is now s 43 of the 1995 Act. The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl 43 provides: 'That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark ... because of some signification inherent to it, would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services .' [Emphasis added] It seems that the final form of s 43 is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose. 'Connotation' is a secondary meaning implied by the mark. The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself. It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s 43 is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question, rather than, for example, deception by reason of similarity with other marks ( TGI Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc [2000] FCA 720 ; (2000) 100 FCR 358 at [43] ; McCorquodale v Masterson at [25] [26]). Section 43 might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients. The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix '-AGRA' will cause the requisite confusion as to whether: (a) the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA; (b) the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients; (c) the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects. In my opinion, there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA. An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation, but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here. CONCLUSION The appeal should be allowed, the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside. The application to register the trade mark should be refused. Karam should pay Pfizer's costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate.

Case10935,considered,Saffron v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 94 ATC 4049,"v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 94 ATC 4049 (Saffron's Case) is a case which preceded the ANZ Savings Bank Case but which was decided after the 1986 amendments. Saffron's Case was an appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, not an appeal in the original jurisdiction against an objection decision. Nonetheless, in his reasons for judgement, Davies J (at 4050-4051) made the following observations of a generic nature as to the role of either this Court or the Tribunal when seized with a challenge to (termed by him a review of) an objection decision: The review authority, the Court or the Tribunal, must come to its own decision on the facts and the issues. Walsh J said in Krew's case at 4216:- ""I have a duty to reach my own conclusions on the questions of fact which have to be decided and to give effect to those conclusions. .. I must make my own decisions as to the facts."" Although the taxpayer may be untruthful and a tax evader, that factor, of itself, is no reason not to undertake a calculation of income tax as contemplated by the Act, if such a calculation can be made. As Walsh J said in Krew's case at 4219, ""A witness upon whose word one cannot rely may yet give evidence which is true in part."" In that case, although Walsh J held that he could not accept the appellant himself as a reliable witness, he nevertheless found that several of the facts alleged by the taxpayer were established as a matter of probability and accordingly that four of the amended assessments before the Court should be set aside. Moreover, in the calculation of the taxable incomes of years past, exact proof may not be available. As Burchett J said in Ma v Commissioner of Taxation (1992) 92 ATC 4373 at 4379:- '... the making of estimates upon Inexact evidence, which IS so much a feature of both judicial and administrative decision-making, cannot be uniquely excluded from appeals against betterment assessments.' If, despite the general untruthfulness of a witness and the lack of records, the Court or the Tribunal nevertheless feels satisfied, as a matter of probability, as to the existence of a relevant fact or factor, effect must be given to that conclusion. Though these observations predate by some months those made later in that year by the High Court in the ANZ Savings Bank Case , they draw upon the same cases which the High Court regarded as authoritative and are not inconsistent with the High Court's own observations. However, though the observation made by Davies J that ""effect must be given to that conclusion"" is no less generic than his Honour's other observations, it is necessary to recall that he was not called upon in that case expressly to decide whether it was within the Court's power to set aside the objection decision so as to increase the amount of an appellant taxpayer's taxable income. The other two judges constituting the Full Court in Saffron's Case , Gummow and Lee JJ, did not find it necessary to make such generic observations."
Case10893,referred to,Bass v Permanent Trustee [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334,"Moore J did not agree with the majority on the question of futility of enforcement. His Honour was of the opinion that both long-standing common law authorities and recent High Court dicta support the proposition that relief should not be granted unless it would be effectual (or unless it there are reasonable grounds to believe an injunction will be effacious in the future). In support of this proposition, Moore J cited the following authorities: Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [31] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J: The term ""matter"" has meaning only in the context of a legal proceeding, as the passages from South Australia v Victoria , Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts, Stack v Coast Securities (No 9) Pty Ltd and Attorney-General (NSW) v Commonwealth Savings Bank demonstrate. A ""matter"" cannot exist in the abstract. If there is no legal remedy for a ""wrong"", there can be no ""matter"". A legally enforceable remedy is as essential to the existence of a ""matter"" as the right, duty or liability which gives rise to the remedy. Without the right to bring a curial proceeding, there can be no ""matter"". If a person breaches a legal duty which is unenforceable in a court of justice, there can be no ""matter"". Such duties are not unknown to the law. For example, in Australian Broadcasting Corp v Redmore Pty Ltd , this court had to consider the effect on a contract of a statutory provision which prohibited the making of the contract without the approval of a minister. The prohibition arose in a context where s 8(1) of the relevant Act imposed a duty on the board of the appellant to ensure that it did not contravene any provision of the Act but s 8(3) provided that ""[n]othing in this section shall be taken to impose on the Board a duty that is enforceable by proceedings in a court"". Although the point did not arise for decision, it is plain that breach of the prohibition was incapable of giving rise to a ""matter"". (footnotes omitted) Truth About Motorways v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd [2000] HCA 11 ; (2000) 200 CLR 591 at [49] per Gaudron J: Absent the availability of relief related to the wrong which the plaintiff alleges, no immediate right, duty or liability is established by the court's determination. Similarly, if there is no available remedy, there is no administration of the relevant law. Thus, as Gleeson CJ and McHugh J pointed out in Abebe v Commonwealth , ""[i]f there is no legal remedy for a `wrong', there can be no `matter' "". Bass v Permanent Trustee [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334 at [47] : Because the object of the judicial process is the final determination of the rights of the parties to an action, courts have traditionally refused to provide answers to hypothetical questions or to give advisory opinions. The jurisdiction with respect to declaratory relief has developed with an awareness of that traditional attitude. In Re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation ), Lord Goff of Chieveley said that: a declaration will not be granted where the question under consideration is not a real question, nor where the person seeking the declaration has no real interest in it, nor where the declaration is sought without proper argument, for example, in default of defence or on admissions or by consent. By ""not a real question"", his Lordship was identifying what he called the ""hypothetical or academic"". The jurisdiction includes the power to declare that conduct which has not yet taken place will not be in breach of a contract or a law and such a declaration will not be hypothetical in the relevant sense.

Case14874,cited,Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165,"The process of construction of a contract is undertaken objectively. In Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ said: 'It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations. What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement. The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean. That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text, but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction.' (citations omitted) And in CEPU 162 FCR at 510 [164]-[165] Weinberg, Bennett and I said: ' In the construction of a contract, the court places itself in the commercial matrix in which the parties were at the time that the contract was made. This is so that the court can construe correctly both the express terms used by the parties and those which are included by implication in order to give effect to their presumed intention. In Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council [2001] FCA 760 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 436 ; 186 ALR 289 at [10] , Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said that it was appropriate to have regard to more than internal linguistic considerations and to consider the circumstances with reference to which the words in question in a contract were used and, from those circumstances, to discern the objective which the parties had in view. They applied what Lord Wilberforce had said, namely that an appreciation of the commercial purpose of the contract ""... presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties are operating"" ( Reardon Smith Line v Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-996). And, in Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 70 ; (2001) 210 CLR 181 at [11] approving Lord Hoffmann in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society (No 1) [1998] 1 WLR 896 at 912, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ said that interpretation of a written contract involved ... the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract.' See also International Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Limited [2008] HCA 3 ; (2008) 242 ALR 47 at 51-52 [8] per Gleeson CJ, at 63 [53] per Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ."
Case2585,discussed,OzEcom &amp; Anor v Hudson Investment Group &amp; Ors [2007] NSWSC 719,"applicants do not submit that Veda was subject to the broad duty of care that I have described. They quoted from the following summary by McDougall J in OzEcom &amp; Anor v Hudson Investment Group &amp; Ors [2007] NSWSC 719 ( OzEcom ) at [321] of the elements of the cause of action in negligence causing pure economic loss extracted from recent High Court judgments: (1) Reasonable foreseeability of loss is not of itself a sufficient basis to impose a duty of care: Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 at 329 [6] (Gleeson CJ; Tame was a case of alleged psychiatric injury, but what his Honour said applies a fortiori to a case of pure economic loss); Sullivan v Moody And Others [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at 576 [420] (another case of alleged psychiatric and other injury; the comment just made in relation to Tame applies). (2) Nonetheless, reasonable foreseeability is a necessary condition of duty: Tame at 355 [103] (McHugh J). (3) The absence of reasonable foreseeability negates the existence of a duty of care (following from (2)). (4) A plaintiff's 'vulnerability', in the sense of its inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant's want of reasonable care, is an important requirement in analysing whether any such duty of care is owed: Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd And Another [2004] HCA 16 ; (2004) 216 CLR 515 at 530 [23] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ). (5) Another important consideration is assumption of responsibility coupled with known reliance: Woolcock Street at 531 [24] (ibid). (6) The existence and terms of any relevant contract may bear upon the existence and content of a duty of care: Astley And Others v Austrust Limited [1999] HCA 6 ; (1999) 197 CLR 1 , 22 [47] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). To adapt the words of Lord Steyn (with whom the rest of the House of Lords agreed) in Williams And Another v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 830 at 857, the role of the law of tort is to fill gaps where other remedies are not available. (7) The relevant statutory and common law context, including the allocation of responsibilities and the provision of remedies, is relevant to the determination, whether a duty of care should be imposed in a particular case: Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241 at 282 and 286 (Mc Hugh J [sic]); and see Perre And Others v Apand Pty Limited [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 192 [5] (Gleeson CJ; his Honour repeated this sentiment in Tame at 329 [6]), 226 [120] (McHugh J)."" As McDougall J acknowledged, the material relevant to the seven headings might overlap to some extent. Veda responded to the applicants' submissions based on the passage from OzEcom set out at [379] above. I therefore turn now to the five elements summarised at [380] above. 1. Foreseeability of economic loss As indicated earlier I am prepared to assume in favour of the applicants that it was reasonably foreseeable that if an inaccurate credit report was issued concerning them, they were likely to suffer economic loss. As also indicated earlier, the assumption may not be warranted. The question whether an applicant actually did suffer economic loss as a result of a particular inaccurate credit report would arise at the damages stage of these proceedings."
Case5731,distinguished,Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio and Anor [1983] HCA 14 ; (1983) 151 CLR 447,"The claim of unconscionable conduct under ss 51AA and/or 51AB of the Trade Practices Act was not properly pleaded. However, senior counsel for Mr Foroughi conceded that the claim was based on the same matters as are the subject of the claim for misleading conduct. Reference was made in Mr Foroughi's written submissions to well-known authorities including Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio and Anor [1983] HCA 14 ; (1983) 151 CLR 447. 140 I do not consider that Mr Foroughi was under any special disability. Nor do I consider that Star City took advantage of him within the well-known statements of principle in Amadio . The findings I have made about the circumstances in which the exclusion order was made are quite inconsistent with any suggestion of unconscionable conduct."
Case12025,cited,Star City Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1701,"I accept that these authorities support the proposition that contemporaneously executed contracts forming part of the same transaction should, as a general rule, be read as a whole and construed by reference to each other: Star City Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1701 at [52] . However, it would go well beyond any concept of contractual context to alter the terms of one contemporaneously executed contract by reference to another where, as here: (1) the parties to each contract are not the same; (2) the term in the contract in question is not ambiguous; and (3) the term in the other contract is directly conflicting. This is especially so where the result is to require an essential term, such as the duration of the contract, to be amended from the written terms of one contract to obtain consistency between the two contracts. To do so would disrupt the longstanding rule that parties are bound by the unambiguous terms of their written agreement unless it is affected by fraud, mistake or misrepresentation: Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471 , 483-84 [33] and [35]. The terms of the Nepalle Guarantee, including its duration, are not ambiguous. In the absence of such ambiguity, the written document stands on its own as a record of the agreement between the parties to it."

Case3305,distinguished,Pelechowski v NSW Land and Housing Commission [2000] FCA 233,"The respondents also relied upon a decision of Madgwick J in Pelechowski v NSW Land and Housing Commission [2000] FCA 233. In that case, the applicant, who was a bankrupt, applied to the Industrial Relations Court for reinstatement as a result of unlawful termination of his employment by the first respondent. Madgwick J found that the trustee had not elected to prosecute the action (s 60(2)) and so the action was deemed to have been abandoned (s 60(3)). 28 The applicant contended that the question is whether the proceeding is after-acquired property within the meaning of s 58(6). Section 58(6) provides: 58(6) In this section, after-acquired property, in relation to a bankrupt, means property that is acquired by, or devolves on, the bankrupt on or after the date of the bankruptcy, being property that is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt. 34 The applicant contended that insofar as the respondents relied on Pelechowski v New South Wales Land and Housing Commission [2000] FCA 233 , that proceeding had been commenced before the making of the sequestration order which meant that the action was caught by s 60(2) of the Act. To that extent, it was contended it was not in point. 80 Madgwick J's decision in Pelechowski v NSW Land and Housing Commission [2000] FCA 233 addressed only the question whether the action was for a personal injury which was the only live issue because of the provisions of s 60(2). The action in that case was commenced before the sequestration order was made and was caught by s 60(2). Section 60(2) catches all actions not excepted by s 60(4). There was no question in that proceeding whether income, wages or earnings payable to the bankrupt after bankruptcy was property of the bankrupt or property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors."
Case9254,referred to,Dias Aluminium Products Pty Ltd v Ullrich Aluminium Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1400,"Such matters are generally not capable of precise arithmetical calculation or analysis and are to a considerable extent matters of impression and judgment. See by analogy Dias Aluminium Products Pty Ltd v Ullrich Aluminium Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1400 at [7] . 20 I also consider that this conduct led to wasted costs in relation to much of the evidence of the respondents' expert Mr John Permewan. I did not afford his evidence any weight, because as I found, he was significantly misdirected by Metricon on a number of significant matters and was not told in the witness box before giving evidence about significant revisions to Metricon's witness statements. As a result, his opinions as to independent derivation were founded upon significantly incorrect assumptions and were of no real assistance to the Court. One example of this was that he incorrectly assumed that the Tyrell, Connolly and Streeton designs and homes were not designed by reference to the Prada 35. In fact, as I found, they were. He did not deal expressly in his report with the actual design drawings from which, according to the respondents, Prototypes 20A and 20B were derived. He assumed that certain evidence given by Bugeja, but which was disavowed by him at trial, was correct and he relied upon it. He accepted that Gallery 32 was used in the derivation of Prada 35. It was not. [252]-[256] Furthermore the applicants put the respondents on notice that Mr Permewan had been misinstructed. The solicitors for the applicants wrote to the respondents' solicitors by letter dated 9 October 2006 stating amongst other things that: Mr Permewan has proffered views about whether or not copying occurred by reference to his beliefs based on the untested evidence of Metricon's witnesses. It is clear from his report that Mr Permewan has taken as truthful, and without qualification, the evidence of Metricon's lay witnesses. I accept that consideration of Mr Permewan's affidavit evidence would have required significant amount of time before analysis on the part of the applicants' solicitors and counsel and indeed also by Dr John Cooke the expert architect obtained by the applicants. The matters deposed to by these lay witnesses may be overridden by the impressions formed by the Court following cross-examination. 21 The respondents should be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis to the extent of 50% of the preparation for trial and for the trial itself. The order should cover the period from early April 2006 when the respondents filed the first of the affidavits of Bugeja, Popple, Palazzesi and Biasin."
Case10791,cited,Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93,"should now be given of the various offers made by Flottweg and of Olivaylle's responses to those offers, including its counteroffers. It is convenient in so doing also to set out Olivaylle's submission as to why I should not regard its rejection of a particular offer as at least imprudent. Flottweg's solicitors to Olivaylle's solicitors - 18 August 2006 Your client has demanded that it be reimbursed the full amount of the purchase price ""in accordance with the contract"". That demand is rejected. Without addressing any of the reasons why the equipment might not have achieved the desired yield, your client is patently not entitled to a full refund under the contract. In particular, and without limitation, the terms of the contract expressly include that ""Flottweg's liability howsoever arising should be limited to 5% of the contract price including damages for delay"" (see page 15 of the order confirmation dated 8 February 2005). Our client appreciates that litigating a matter to judgment carries risks, expense and delays. Our client would prefer to reach a commercial solution with your client, including in order to preserve the business relationship that was established between our respective clients which (which have been instructed) has been otherwise good. Our client is prepared to settle the dispute with your client on the following terms: Our client pay to your client 10% of the asserted contract price, namely $113,112.40. The end date of the warranty period be extended from 28 February 2007 to 30 Jun 2007. This offer remains open for acceptance until 5pm on 1 September 2006 after which time it will lapse. In making this offer, our client does not make any admission or concession. It is simply made in order to attempt to resolve the dispute on a commercial basis. Olivaylle's submission : It was submitted that the letter was sent before the institution of proceedings, contained no supporting rationale, did not acknowledge a right of withdrawal and in any event was open for only a short period. The point concerning the sending of the offer before proceedings was not one chronology but rather related to the absence of a supporting rationale and was put as a way of highlighting that Olivaylle was not at that stage seized with knowledge of the case that came to be put against it. Having regard to these circumstances, it was submitted that it was not unreasonable for Olivaylle to have rejected this offer. Olivaylle's solicitors to Flottweg's solicitors - 30 August 2006 [O]ur client was entitled to withdraw from the contract after the expiry of a reasonable period of grace. On 21 February 2006 our client wrote to your client putting them on notice that unless the Olive Oil Line was modified or rectified to enable it to comply with the contract, our client would withdraw from the contract on 30 June 2006. Our client reiterated on 19 June 2006 that unless your client could solve the five problems as listed in that letter, it would cancel the contract. Again our client confirmed that it had provided your client with a period of grace to the end of 30 June 2006 to correct the non-conforming items. As you are aware, on 25 July 2006 Wallmans Lawyers, on behalf of our client, sent a letter to your client and amongst other things, put your client ""...on notice that the period of grace has expired and our client has withdrawn from the contract."" Our client is therefore entitled to have the purchase price refunded. We confirm that our client has instructed us to make one final attempt at settling this matter before proceedings are commenced in the Federal Court of Australia (Adelaide Registry). The without prejudice offer is as follows: Within seven days of receipt of this letter, your client will pay into Wallmans' trust account the sum of $224,339.96 being the value of the letter of credit as converted by your client from Wachovia Bank LC #SM 212584W on 1 August 2006 after having been notified that our client had withdrawn from the contract. On or before 30 January 2007 your client to supply and exchange their present decanter model #Z53-4/454 for their newest decanter model #Z73-4/454 in sealed N 2 version, including SIMP drive, on the run decanter settings and adjustments, change capabilities, all electronic items pertaining to this model, including the under decanter sieve and exchange of the bowl of the Flottweg separator AT1600DL in nitrogen flushed version for your client's newest improved bowl. Your client will then proceed to water test these items. No latter than 30 January 2007 your client will have delivered and installed a new substitute 100 rpm gearbox for the inclined paste conveyors into the malaxeurs, to replace the much slower gearbox mistakenly sent, by your client, for the 2006 harvest. Your client will extend the present processing line contract warranties to 30 days after the completion of the 2008 harvest. Once the items in points 2 and 3 above have been supplied and installed and tested to our client' satisfaction, our client will then pay your client the sum of $112,169.98 (being 50% of the amount returned to your client as set out in point 1 above). During the 2007 harvest, scheduled to commence mid-April 2007, your client's processing line will be tested for compliance with the following contract guaranteed parameters: (1) Minimum throughput of 5 tonnes per hour starting at the olive washer/deleafer; (2) Minimum processing line oil recovery of 85% of the maximum oil content in the olives as determined by an approved IOOC laboratory; (3) Processing line oxygen level starting at the malaxeurs of less than 1% oxygen. After your client has complied with points to 6 above, our client will pay your client the sum of $67,301.99 (being 30% of the amount returned by your client as set out in point 1 above). After your client has corrected any deficiencies found during the 2007 olive harvest either by repair or replacement, and the process line has met all guarantees contained in the contract of 8 February 2005, our client will pay to your client the sum of $44,867.99 (being 20% of the sum returned by your client as set out in point 1 above) after deducting from that sum all of our client's reasonable legal costs. We would be pleased if you would obtain your client's instructions in respect of the above offer. Should your client accept the above offer, Wallmans Lawyers will attend to drafting the requisite Deed of Discharge and Release. Flottweg's solicitors to Olivaylle's solicitors 5 September 2006 Our client has considered your client's settlement offer. In our client's view that offer represents a much more reasonable position than has hitherto been adopted by your client. However, our client cannot accept that offer in its current form as it: leaves aspects of performance subject to your client's discretion; and does not address what should happen in the event that the parameters in 6.1 to 6.3 of your client's offer are not met and accordingly leaves the matter potentially unresolved. Our client proposes that the matter be settled on the following terms: Our client pay to your client 5% of the asserted contract price, namely $56,556.20 within 7 days of a binding agreement having been executed. Our client provide your client with the following items of replacement equipment free of charge: (a) 1 x Decanter model Z6E-4/454 SIMP DRIVE, including electrical installation, necessary frequency converters, solids outlet, feed inlet and base frame. (Note that the model Z73/4/454 is not available in olive oil version); (b) Exchange Bowl of Flottweg Separator AC1500; and (c) 1 x 100rpm gearbox for screw conveyor, all within 5 months ex works Germany (approximately 6 &#189; months DDP Kaniva) after a binding agreement having been executed. Subject to 4 below, the end date of the warranty period in respect of the design and quality of the materials in the equipment supplied (including replacement parts to be supplied) be extended from 28 February 2007 to 30 June 2007. Your client to provide a comprehensive release to our client from or in respect of any claims or obligations (present or future) in relation to the equipment supplied, including, but not limited to, oil yield, sustained oxygen level and process tonnage throughput. This offer is an offer in principle only and is not (by acceptance or otherwise) intended to give rise to binding legal relations. As an offer in principle it remains open for acceptance until 5pm on 11 September 2006 after which time it will lapse. In making this offer, our client does not make any admission or concession. It is simply made in order to attempt to resolve the dispute on a commercial basis. If this offer is not accepted or lapses then our client's reserves its rights to tender this letter to the Court following judgment in relation to the award of costs. Olivaylle's submission: The submissions made in respect of Flottweg's solicitor's letter of 30 August 2006 were repeated. In addition, it was submitted that, when regard was had to the form of release proposed, the offer of replacement equipment had about it the quality of giving with one hand and taking with the other. Olivaylle might still have been left with a line that met none of the contractual performance criteria. It was further submitted that the offer was one in principle only, ie it was not capable of immediate acceptance. In all of these circumstances it was submitted that it was not unreasonable for Olivaylle to have rejected it. Olivaylle's solicitors to Flottweg's solicitors 7 September 2006 Our client rejects your client's offer contained within the facsimile of 5 September 2006. Our client reiterates the offer as set out in our facsimile of 30 August 2006. Our client instructs us to keep the offer open until the close of business on Friday 8 September 2006. Should the sum of $224,339.96 not be deposited into Wallmans Trust Account, being: National Australia Bank BSB: 085 086 Account No: 50-799-4198 we will file proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia and serve the same direct on your client. Unless we hear from you before the close of business on Friday 8 September 2006, we will no longer communicate with you but only with your client until advised otherwise. Flottweg's solicitors to Olivaylle's solicitors - 30 January 2007 We refer to the letter from you to our client of 16 November 2006 and your client's Application and Statement of Claim. We note that in your letter you stated that: ""We put you on notice that whilst the Olive Oil Line remains in our client's possession that our client merely treats themselves (sic) as caretakers of the Olive Oil Line and that all losses which they are now incurring or have incurred since entering into the contract with you have been and will continue to be, in your account."" We also note that in your client's Application it seeks an order that ""Flottweg collect the Olive Oil Line"". Can our client take it from those statements that your client does not intend to use the Olive Oil Line in future? If so, then our client would be prepared, without admission and without prejudice to your client's claim, to collect the Olive Oil Line and pay to your client the net proceeds of any future re-sale. If, on the other hand, your client intends to use the Olive Oil Line in future then please advise the value that your client presently ascribes to the equipment. This information is necessary as if the value that your client ascribes to the equipment is less that that which our client would expect it to reach on the second hand market then our client may be prepared, again without admission and without prejudice to your client's claim, to remove the equipment and pay to your client the net proceeds (after deducting our client's costs) of any re-sale. For the avoidance of any doubt, our client's proposal would be without prejudice to your client's rights to seek to claim any balance from our client in the current proceedings. We note that arrangements would need to be agreed in relation to the inspection and testing of the equipment by both parties for the purpose of evidence in the proceedings prior to its removal. We see no reason why satisfactory arrangements could not be agreed. If your client does not intend to continue using the equipment then a decision as to the above matters must be made soon. If your client declines or does not respond to our client's offer then our client will rely on this letter and the in-principle offer contained in it in relation to any issue of damages and mitigation to which it may be relevant. Olivaylle's submission : In respect of this letter, too, it was submitted that the offer was one ""in principle"" only and not expressed in clear and unambiguous terms. On these bases it was submitted that the offer was not one which ought to be regarded as of the type and with the consequence described by Cairns LJ, Scarman LJ and Sir George Wilmer agreeing, in the well known case, Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93 at 105-106. Offer of Compromise Flottweg to Olivaylle 14 August 2007 The following offer of compromise is made pursuant to Order 23 rule 2(1) of the Federal Court Rules . Without prejudice and without admissions the respondent offers to compromise these proceedings on the basis that the respondent pays the applicant the sum of $322,000.00 (exclusive of costs) in full and final satisfaction of all claims made by the applicant in these proceedings. This offer is open for acceptance by the applicant for a period of 28 days from the date of this offer. Following a query on the subject of costs made by Olivaylle's solicitors upon the receipt of this offer, Flottweg's solicitors replied on 30 August 2007 that, ""This offer is exclusive of costs. That is, if accepted, our client will be required to pay your client's costs in an amount as taxed or as agreed."" Olivaylle's submission : This was said to be an offer which but purported to comply with the Rules. It was submitted that it was not accompanied by any explanation and that, in those circumstances it was not unreasonable to reject it. It was further submitted that, upon its expiry, it was spent, having no ambulatory effect. Thus, later developments such as the service of the filing of Flottweg's affidavit material in response to the original pre-trial directions and the opportunity thus presented for knowing the case Flottweg intended to present factually were irrelevant. More generally, I was, on Olivaylle's behalf, quite properly reminded of an observation which I had made when deciding the costs consequence of the application by Flottweg for leave to adduce evidence from Mr Lorenz, that the grant of leave might also have consequences in relation to the determination of the costs of the trial. The reminder was made as part of a submission that the case ultimately exposed to Olivaylle at trial by Flottweg was different in its evidentiary sweep to that which existed in chief at its commencement. It was further submitted on Olivaylle's behalf that there were multiple issues in the trial in which the evidence overlapped in terms of relevance. By way of example, it was submitted that, even if it were concluded that Ms Ash's evidence carried with it for Olivaylle a particular cautionary note in terms of pressing a case for damages resulting from a lost or postponed opportunity to derive profits in the American market, the evidence necessary to show that the contractual performance criteria had been breached, which was one precondition to the proving of such a loss, overlapped with proofs necessary to show that the contractually conferred right to withdraw had arisen. It was also noted that Ms Ash's evidence was not available to Olivaylle even when the time for acceptance of the last of Flottweg's offers was open. Yet further, it was submitted that the contractual right of withdrawal was novel in terms of local precedent, such that it was not unreasonable in any event for Olivaylle to press a case for a refund in full of the price paid. This was linked with the submission as to overlapping evidence by way of developing an argument that, even if Olivaylle had failed in its claim for damages in respect of the lost or postponed American market opportunity, but succeeded in proving a right to withdraw, it may well have received the whole or most of the costs of the proceeding. It was consequentially submitted that it was neither unreasonable nor imprudent for Olivaylle to have pressed ahead with the whole of its case notwithstanding the offers successively made. In this regard, it was submitted that it was necessary to guard against the application of the false wisdom of hindsight to forensic value judgements which were not unreasonable at the time they were made. I am bound to follow matters of principle enunciated by the Full Court. In that regard, it may be, as Buchanan J highlights in the following passage from his judgment in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 at 597, [22] , that there is a difference in opinion at intermediate appellate level as to whether, for the purpose of satisfying a condition precedent to the awarding of indemnity costs and as an alternative to ""imprudent"", the rejection of an offer of compromise should be able to be described as ""unreasonable"" or ""plainly unreasonable"": In Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 ( Dukemaster) Sundberg and Emmett JJ said, in a case like the present where O 23 r 11 did not apply because an applicant had been wholly unsuccessful, that an applicant for a more generous award of costs than party-party costs 'must show that the rejection of the offer was imprudent or plainly unreasonable' (see at [7]). There has been doubt expressed about the soundness of the statement in Dukemaster that rejection of an offer, if unreasonable, must be 'plainly unreasonable' in the light of the earlier judgment of a Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] [218], to which Wilcox J also referred in Coshott (see Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 at [59] [62]). In the earlier of the Full Court authorities, Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at 432-433, [218] , the point was made that the conduct of an offeree need not be ""plainly unreasonable"" in order to warrant the ordering of indemnity costs because ""To adopt an especially high standard of unreasonableness would operate as a fetter on the discretion to award indemnity costs and diminish the effectiveness of the Calderbank offer as an incentive to settlement."" I respectfully agree and, for that reason, would choose to follow the earlier Full Court authority were that to be critical to the resolution of the costs application. It is not though because in both Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 and Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 the alternative of imprudent rejection was acknowledged. Like Buchanan J in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) and, as his Honour noted (at [22]), like Heerey J in AFP Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [24] [25], it is sufficient to assess whether the rejection of any of the offers was, ""imprudent"". That basis of assessment accords with the exemplar given by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited , which I have already noted, whose judgment, as Heerey J acknowledged in AFP Properties (ibid), is the locus classicus on the subject."
Case535,cited,Insurance Commissioner v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited (No 2) (1982) 49 ALR 714,"Construction Industry Long Service Leave Board v Odco Pty Ltd (No 2) (1988) ATPR p40-887 at 49,604, Jenkinson J observed that this Court would be likely to grant an application for a trial by a jury in a matter where claims under the Trade Practices Act were ""tenuous"" and the real subject matter was a defamation action. He distinguished an earlier decision of Northrop J in Insurance Commissioner v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited (No 2) (1982) 49 ALR 714 who refused to order a trial by jury of a claim by a comprehensive insurer of motor vehicles for damages arising from a contravention of s 52 by radio and television advertisements. Neither of those proceedings appears to have involved an individual's right to his or her personal reputation or allegations of the kind involved in the publications complained of here. This factor was considered to be of significance by Tamberlin J in Stalyce Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd v Cetec Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR p41-866 at 44,852 [15]."
Case2990,followed,Karmot Auto Spares Pty Limited v Dominelli Ford (Hurstville) Pty Ltd (1992) 35 FCR 560 at 565,"The Loan Account Statements on their face purport to be documents recording financial transactions, namely loans, involving Rural Finance. They are ""records"" in the sense that they are part of a repository of information in organised form which is accessible in the ordinary course of a business and for the purposes of that business: Karmot Auto Spares Pty Limited v Dominelli Ford (Hurstville) Pty Ltd (1992) 35 FCR 560 at 565. The Receivers found the documents amongst the business records of Rural Finance when they took control of those records. I find that they were part of Rural Finance's records within the meaning of s 69(1)(a)(i). 25 The terms of s 69(2)(a) do not suggest that it is an essential precondition of admissibility that the ""person"" in question be identified. The ordinary meaning of the language is that it is sufficient that the person who made the representation, whoever he or she is, had or might reasonably be supposed to have had, personal knowledge of the asserted fact. The policy behind the provision is clear enough. Routine business records, made before any legal proceeding arises or is contemplated (cf the exception in s 69(3)), have an inherent likelihood of reliability which outweighs the common law's aversion to hearsay evidence where the maker of a statement cannot be tested by cross-examination. The utility of s 69 would be greatly diminished if it were necessary to locate among large organisations, perhaps over a long period of time, persons who made representations, often in circumstances where the practical needs of the organisation did not require any identification at the time the representations were made. 26 Prior to the Evidence Act , all Australian jurisdictions had legislation based on provisions of the Evidence Act 1938 (Imp) which rendered admissible statements made in documents outside court where, inter alia, the document formed part of a continuous record. Examples were the Evidence Act 1898 (NSW) ss 14B-14C and the Evidence Act 1958 (Vic) s 5. Such legislation required the maker of the statement to be called as a witness, although that requirement could be dispensed with in certain circumstances, such as death or absence ""beyond the seas"". The present s 69 , however, says nothing about calling the maker of the statement as a witness. It is therefore hard to see why one should read into the section an obligation to identify the ""person"" where there is no need for that person to be called."
Case11706,referred to,Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 162 CLR 476,"The decision by the Minister to cancel the applicant's visa was a ' privative clause decision ': Migration Act s 474(2) , (3)(b). Accordingly, the applicant is entitled to the relief he claims, or some variation thereof, only if he can establish that the Minister has committed jurisdictional error: Migration Act s 474(1) ; Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476. In my opinion, none of the grounds identified by the applicant establishes jurisdictional error by the Minister in connection with the making of the visa cancellation decision. 39 The first ground merely asserts the existence of jurisdictional error, without providing particulars or any basis for the assertion. 40 The second ground seems to challenge the Minister's conclusion that the applicant had a substantial criminal record for the purposes of s 501(7) of the Migration Act . It is clear, however, that the applicant satisfied the definition. He was initially sentenced to life imprisonment following his conviction for murder and, subsequently, to a redetermined sentence of 21 years, with a minimum custodial term of 16 years."
Case22584,cited,The State of Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146,"In The State of Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, the joint judgment of Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ cited with approval (at 152-153) a passage from the judgment of Bowen LJ in Cropper v Smith (1884) 26 Ch D 700, at 710, as follows: 'Now, I think it is a well established principle that the object of Courts is to decide the rights of the parties, and not to punish them for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights. Speaking for myself, and in conformity with what I have heard laid down by the other division of the Court of Appeal and by myself as a member of it, I know of no kind of error or mistake which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, the Court ought not to correct, if it can be done without injustice to the other party. Courts do not exist for the sake of discipline, but for the sake of deciding matters in controversy, and I do not regard such amendment as a matter of favour or of grace.' 14 The joint judgment in J L Holdings emphasised (at 154) that the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of justice and that no principle of case management can supplant that aim. The latter comment reflected the fact that in J L Holdings itself, the application for leave to amend pleadings had been refused by the trial Judge some six months before the hearing was due to commence. The application to amend in the present case has been made towards the end of the hearing in an extraordinarily long and complex case. 15 If leave could be granted to Seven to amend para 222 without causing significant prejudice to Optus and the other respondents, I would grant the necessary leave, even at this late stage of the proceedings. I would do so notwithstanding the absence of an explanation on affidavit as to the reason for Seven's failure until now to plead the retail minus formula. The critical question, therefore, is whether the amendment, if made, will occasion significant prejudice to the respondents in the conduct of the trial. 16 Mr Sheahan submitted that the amendment would cause no significant prejudice to the respondents because they have in fact addressed the question of whether Optus was an effective competitor on price and quality, both in relation to the period before and the period after the CSA. According to Mr Sheahan, there is no further factual inquiry that the respondents could make that has not already arisen on the pleadings. He pointed out, for example, that Optus' expert, Professor Hausman, adverted in his report to the fact that Foxtel and Optus now offer 'essentially the same product for which Optus pays a licence fee determined by reference to Foxtel's retail price'. Mr Sheahan also directed attention to the fact that one of Seven's competition experts, Professor Noll, referred in his report to the retail minus formula as eliminating the possibility of price competition between Foxtel and Optus where their services overlap."

On 6 May 2008 the judgment debt was varied by the Supreme Court of Western Australia to reduce it by $31,007.72. This reflects the amount of certain payments and credits which, since the date of judgment, the applicant volunteered should be applied to the judgment debt by way of reduction. The bankruptcy notice claimed an amount that is calculated by reference to the amount of the original judgment. It is not to the point that the amount of that judgment has been reduced: Emerson v Wreckair Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 16 ; (1992) 33 FCR 581 at 587. The affidavit of Deborah Jayne Thiele sworn on 12 May 2008, on behalf of the applicant deposes that the amount of the outstanding debt as at that date was $37,983,152.29. This is the amount contained in the Amended Creditor's Petition less the amount by which the judgment debt was varied as well as the further amount of $17,940 in respect of credits applied after December 2007.

Case17589,cited,Scharer v State of New South Wales [2001] NSWCA 360 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 299,"[18], the Chief Justice referred to Scharer v State of New South Wales [2001] NSWCA 360 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 299 , in which Davies A-JA said (at 313) that under the AD(JR) Act: The crux of the issue in each case is whether the enactment has played a relevant part in affecting or effecting rights or obligations. A grant of authority to do that which under the general law a person has authority to do is not regarded as sufficient. The right to require production of Documents 226 to 238 is given by O 33 r 12 which applies to any party to any proceeding before this Court. The same can be said of other procedural rights given by the FCRs directly, or of the right given by them to apply for a procedural benefit of one kind or another, such as the right to apply for leave to issue a subpoena or the right to apply for an order for discovery. Gleeson CJ held that the termination of Ms Tang's candidature occurred under the general law and under the terms and conditions on which the University was willing to enter into a relationship with her, and added (at [23]): The power to formulate those terms and conditions, to decide to enter into the relationship, and to decide to end it, was conferred in general terms by the Griffith University Act , but the decision to end the relationship was not given legal force or effect by that Act. Mr O'Neill's decision was one step antecedent to the decision (by a different officer) to give the notice to produce. Mr O'Neill's decision to exclude Documents 226 to 238 from the scope of the concession can be usefully compared to a decision provided for by the Griffith University's policy that a candidate had been guilty of academic misconduct. Such a decision would have gained nothing in terms of susceptibility to judicial review by reason of its being distinct from the decision to exclude a student; likewise, Mr O'Neill's decision to allow access to Documents 226 to 238 vis-a-vis the decision to give the notice to produce them in the appeal proceedings."

Case3953,considered,WAAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399,"In WAAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 , at [7] the Full Court gave a reminder that the purpose for which the discretion to extend time is conferred is to do justice between the parties observing of an example where the delay was short and no injustice would be occasioned to a respondent that justice would usually be done if the extension of time were granted. 15 There could be no shorter delay than that presented in this case. No prejudice to the Minister was asserted. In such circumstances the question of the applicant's prospects of success in the proposed appeal has a determinative quality in relation to the exercise of the discretion to extend time. 16 Only one ground of appeal is specified in that draft notice of appeal. That is that the learned Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find the following alleged jurisdictional error: ""I have been a Falun Gong practitioner since 1999. I persecuted by the Chinese authorities. I presented the documents: ""Labour Reform Relief Assessment Form"" and ""[Named] People's Hospital Diagnosis"" issued by the official authorities were not accepted by the Tribunal. I think the Tribunal has bias against me. The Tribunal didn't take my claims into account. The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error."" [sic, omitting name of particular hospital] 17 The way in which the Applicant has formulated his ground of challenge reflects his lack of legal training. That does not mean that it fails to state a ground of challenge known to law. The Minister apprehended that the essence of the desired appeal was that the Federal Magistrates Court had erred in failing to set aside the Tribunal's decision on the basis that a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Tribunal had been shown. This seems to me to be a fair way to approach the matter, especially having regard to the ground of review particularised in the amended application lodged in the Federal Magistrates Court. 18 In the amended application to the Federal Magistrates Court the apprehended bias ground was pleaded in this way: ""1. The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in that the Tribunal denied the applicant procedural fairness by reason of there being a reasonable apprehension of bias. PARTICULARS (a) The fact-finding by the Tribunal was performed in a manner which in major respect was capricious, arbitrary, unreasoned, consisted of assertion, lacked rational or reasoned foundations, and/or was in relation to the preponderance of findings selective of material or conclusions going one way only, such that a fair-minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the decision maker might not have brought an impartial mind to bear on the decision. (b) The findings of fact to which the fair-minded and informed person might reasonably have regard in forming the apprehension include: 1. The finding that the applicant has learned a few basic facts about the movement (that being Falun Gong). 2. The finding that the applicant had no apparent knowledge or understanding of the philosophy of Falun Gong. 3. The finding that the applicant had no apparent knowledge or understanding of how it was that practising Falun Gong achieved the benefits and outcomes claimed by practitioners. 4. The applicant had no apparent understanding of the key concept of ""truthfulness, benevolence and forbearance"". 5. The finding that the applicant had ample opportunity at the hearing to demonstrate his knowledge and/or understanding of Falun Gong. 6. The applicant's discussion of Falun Gong was trite and shallow. 7. The finding that the applicant's account shows that he had given seemingly low priority to Falun Gong in Australia. 8. The finding that the Applicant had changed his evidence in relation to why he had stopped exercising in a park. 9. The finding that the applicant's claim to have participated rather than just observed a singing performance in support of withdrawing from the Communist Party had evolved in response to the Tribunal's questions. 10. The finding that there was a change in evidence in relation to the applicant's contact with Falun Gong practitioners in Australia. 11. The finding that the information contained in the purportedly corroborative documents of the applicants claim as to having been sent to labour reform for detention for one year and suffered injury whilst detained are not genuine and that the Tribunal gives no weight to the documents. 12. The finding that the applicant's failure to advise the Department of the purportedly corroborative documents and the conclusion that the applicant did not hold the documents in October 2006 and that he concocted this claim as to having held the documents at that time. 13. The findings in relation to the document from the [the particular named] People's Hospital to the effect that as the document does not show how the injury came about it went against the claim that he was injured in the way he described. 14. The findings in relation to the applicant's differing statements as to his recollection of one of the names of the policeman who had struck him in May 2002. 15. The findings that the explanation by the applicant as to what happened to the persons who were detained and assaulted with him in May 2002 changed during the hearing thus suggesting that the applicant was fabricating claims and details as he gave evidence at the hearing. 16. The findings in relation to the two day difference appearing in the Labour Reform Relief Assessment Form and the finding that the applicant had dissembled in relation to the date of his detention. 17. The finding that the Tribunal's conclusions were reinforced by the applicant's arrangements to depart China. 18. The finding that there was a difference in the claims made in relation to how the applicant obtained his passport, such that it supported a finding that the applicant was fabricating claims and details as he gave evidence at the hearing. 19. The reliance on the passport being stated as having been issued on 21 January 2005, when the applicants claim was that the passport had been illegally obtained and the Tribunal elsewhere in the Decision accepted the prevalence of the irregular or improper issue of documentation. 20. The rejection of any need to consider whether the applicant or his wife had to get the assistance of a ""connection"" to get his passport on the basis that the Tribunal did not accept that the applicant was a Falun Gong practitioner known to the authorities. Yet the Tribunal relied on the applicants travel arrangements to find reinforcement for its conclusions concerning his Falun Gong practice. 21. The finding that the Tribunal did not accept that the applicant has had any association with the Falun Gong movement in Australia or has practised Falun Gong in Australia despite, and the failure to have regard to the evidence from the applicant's migration agent that she only represents applicants who claimed to have been Falun Gong practitioners on referral from known Falun Gong practitioners in Australia.""

Case2966,cited,Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd v Southern Pacific Petroleum NL [2005] VSCA 228,"The respondents admit they breached an implied term of the Offer Letter, namely that the respondents would not seek to prevent performance of the Offer Letter or withhold its benefits: Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68, 70-71 cited and referred to in Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investment Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 , 607; Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd v Southern Pacific Petroleum NL [2005] VSCA 228 and CGU Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd v Garcia (2007) 69 NSWLR 680.

Case18819,cited,"Re East, ex parte Nguyen [1998] HCA 73 ; (1998) 196 CLR 354","Further, it is clear that legislation may create personal statutory rights which can be enforced by an individual in a Court of law: Wool Sliping and Scouring Co Ltd v Central Wool Committee [1920] HCA 21 ; (1920) 28 CLR 51 per Knox CJ at 61-62; Grand Central Car Park Pty Ltd v Tivoli Freeholders [1969] VR 62 at 76; SS Constructions Pty Ltd v Ventura Motors Pty Ltd [1964] VR 229 at 246, Dajon Investments Pty Ltd v Talbot [1969] VR 603 at 613, Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 537, 542-544; Re East, ex parte Nguyen [1998] HCA 73 ; (1998) 196 CLR 354. As Stephen J observed in Australian Conservation Foundation 146 CLR at 541, referring to s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth): statutes may of course confer standing in express terms...they may also do so by conferring some right the denial of the enjoyment of which gives standing to sue to complain of that denial. Although that very denial might be thought to qualify as the suffering of special damage such as that of which Buckley J spoke, it is, perhaps, preferable in such a case to resolve the question of standing by the direct route of a search for enforceable rights conferred by statute, rather than follow the circuitous course of seeking, in accordance with Boyce's Case, for the existence of special damage. (cf Gibbs J at 532) 31 In contrast, in the case before me the HREOC Act and the DD Act (including the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s 31) provide a scheme which allows ""a person aggrieved"" by alleged unlawful discrimination - including, as I have already noted, conduct deemed unlawful by s 32 DD Act - to lodge a complaint with HREOC (s 46P HREOC Act); and in the event that the complaint is terminated, a person affected by the termination to make application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court (s 46PO HREOC Act). Significantly, the HREOC Act also creates a specific structure sanctioning applications to the Court for remedies where the Court is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination, including payment of damages by the respondent, employment or re-employment an applicant, an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination as is sought in this case (s 46PO(4) HREOC Act). Indeed the point of the statutory scheme as constituted in this case by the HREOC Act and the DD Act is to make laws with respect to discriminatory conduct, and to allow those who are aggrieved by discriminatory conduct, personal rights to seek redress in respect of such conduct. To adopt the language of the majority of the High Court in Re East, ex parte Nguyen 196 CLR at 365, repeated in Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 at 96, The elaborate and special scheme...was plainly intended by the Parliament to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention ... might obtain a remedy, and thus was regarded by Parliament as fulfilling Australia's treaty obligations, bearing always in mind the legal structure and system which formed the context in which the [legislation] was to operate. (That those comments were in respect of the legislation as it stood prior to amendments, and the removal of provisions from the HREOC Act into the DD Act and other statutes, does not in any way minimise their relevance. As observed, in my view correctly, by Nicholson J in Bropho v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 1209 at [26] - [29] and [51]-[52], they are equally applicable to the scheme as it presently exists.) 45 Sixth, in interpreting ""person aggrieved"" in this context, it is appropriate to accord a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the relevant legislation rather than a construction that would not promote that purpose or object: s 15AA(1) Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). In light of the scheme created by the interaction of the HREOC Act and the DD Act for the purpose of permitting aggrieved persons to make complaints in relation to unlawful discrimination, it is prima facie appropriate to extend a consideration of the term beyond the purpose of the HREOC Act to include the purpose of the DD Act . This is particularly so given that the unlawful discrimination alleged derives from ss 31 and 32 DD Act . I have already noted observations of the High Court in Re East, ex parte Nguyen [1998] HCA 73 ; 196 CLR 354 as to the intentions of Parliament in relation to the scheme to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention might obtain a remedy. I also note the objects of the DD Act as stated in s 3 of the Act: The objects of this Act are: (a) to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination against persons on the ground of disability in the areas of: (i) work, accommodation, education, access to premises, clubs and sport; and (ii) the provision of goods, facilities, services and land; and (iii) existing laws; and (iv) the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and (b) to ensure, as far as practicable, that persons with disabilities have the same rights to equality before the law as the rest of the community; and (c) to promote recognition and acceptance within the community of the principle that persons with disabilities have the same fundamental rights as the rest of the community."
Case14267,cited,Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57,"this case, I am satisfied having regard to the affidavit of Ms Kelly Gardner and the matters deposed to by Mr Grigson, that a prima facie case or serious question to be tried is made out on the substantive question for the purposes of Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57 (particularly at [65] to [72]). Having regard to that matter, I am satisfied that an injunction order ought to be made directed to the first respondent. The affidavit of Ms Gardner also deposes to a conversation she had with the first respondent in which the first respondent confirmed his address for receipt of particular material and said that he had signed and would return straightaway a form effecting a forfeiture of the particular articles. That did not occur. The conversation suggests plainly an inference that the respondent accepts that the goods are counterfeit goods. The notice in question is a Notice of Consent to Forfeit Goods under Part 13 the Trade Marks Act . Being satisfied of those matters and particularly having regard to the paragraphs of Ms Gardner's affidavit, namely, paragraphs 30 to 33, taken in conjunction with paragraph 3, I am satisfied that although only two of the articles are the subject of the counterfeit analysis by her, an inference arises that if two of the articles, depicted in the material, are established as counterfeit articles, then the remaining eight articles making up the bundle of 10 articles the subject of the notice, would also be likely to be counterfeit articles. Being satisfied of those matters, it is appropriate to make an order restraining the first respondent in terms of the proposed interlocutory injunction. Since the articles are demonstrated on the material, at least at the standard of a serious question to be tried or prima facie case, to be counterfeit articles, it seems to me that the status quo ought to be preserved by making an order directed to the Customs CEO not to release the counterfeit articles into the hands of the designated owner. I am satisfied that in light of the serious question to be tried, an order ought to be made under s 137(5) , both having regard to its intersection with s 136(1) and its context within Part 13 more generally and the circumstances to be determined in the proceedings."

Case17260,applied,Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (admin appted) &amp; Ors (No.2) [2006] FCA 1285 ,"In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (admin appted) &amp; Ors (No.2) [2006] FCA 1285 , Finkelstein J described the factual background to these proceedings in the following terms: ""Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (admin apptd) [""MFL""] and MFL Property Holdings Pty Ltd (admin apptd) [""MFPL""] , by their directors, ... Stephen O'Neill, Gary O'Neill and Jolanta Olszewski - promoted a scheme that enticed home-owners, typically retirees or pensioners, to sell their homes in return for what the promoters described as a 'guaranteed' income and a 'guaranteed' right to live in their former home for life. Many people were induced to participate in the scheme. The idea was that the home-owners could free up and live off the equity that would otherwise be tied up in their family home. To the great misfortune of those people the scheme collapsed. The companies that purchased their homes (the purchaser was either MFL or MFLP) are insolvent and have had administrators appointed. The 'guaranteed income' is not being paid. For some, their life tenancy may be at risk."" I will describe this as the 'MFL Scheme'. 3 Six home-owners of the kind described by Finkelstein J commenced these proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against MFL, MFPL, the directors of MFL, Diakou Faigen, four third party investors and three lenders. 4 The applicants comprise a number of categories. Category A group members are those who, at the date of filing of the Application, had entered into Contracts of Sale of their property (""Contracts of Sale""), either Deeds or Deeds of Agreement (""Deeds of Agreement"") and either Residential Tenancy Agreements or Deeds of Tenancy (""Leases"") with MFL and remained registered proprietors of their respective properties. The first applicant is a member of this category. Category B group members are those who, at the date of filing of the Application, had entered into Contracts of Sale, Deeds of Agreement and Leases with MFL but the title to whose respective properties the subject of the Contract of Sale was registered in the name of MFL. The second and third applicants are members of this category. Category C group members are those who, at the date of filing of the Application, had entered into Contracts of Sale, Deeds of Agreement and Leases with MFPL and whose title to their respective properties the subject of the Contract of Sale was registered in the name of MFPL. The fourth to sixth applicants are members of this category. 5 Each of the applicants retained the thirteenth respondent, Diakou Faigen, to advise them prior to entry into the MFL Scheme and to prepare the necessary contract documentation to facilitate their entry into the MFL Scheme. As a consequence of the collapse of the MFL Scheme, the applicants suffered loss and damage. The applicants alleged that their losses and damages were caused by Diakou Faigen having breached its retainer and its duty of care and the fiduciary duties owed to the applicants."
Case13403,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688,"The Court's discretion under s 601AH is very wide. The factors to be taken into account in the exercise of that discretion include the circumstances in which the company was de-registered, the purpose in seeking its re-registration and the likely prejudice to any person; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688 at 693. In this case the purpose of the order is to allow the company to take its place alongside the other asset vendors as a respondent and cross-claimant in the proceedings. As such, its fortunes would stand or fall with the other respondents and cross-claimants. The company's ability to contribute financially to any order made against the respondents would depend on its success in the cross-claim, however there is no suggestion that its position in defending the claims made by the applicants in the main proceeding or in pursuing the cross-claim would differ from that of the other respondents and cross-claimants. At this stage there has been no submission that the company's participation would be likely to add to the costs in the proceeding. 5 The applicants on the notice of motion have tendered a letter dated 17 March 2008 from ASIC which states that ASIC does not oppose the application on the following conditions: 1. The order sought for reinstatement is in terms of section 601AH(2) of the Corporations Act , requiring ASIC to reinstate the registration of the company; 2. The company (if ordered to be reinstated) continues in liquidation (subject to any order made by the Court in this regard) and a liquidator appointed; 3. The Court order is lodged with ASIC ... so that the company may be reinstated; 4. The Applicant pays ASIC's costs of $434 for consideration of this matter; 5. The applicant notifies ASIC upon conclusion of the winding up so that the company may be deregistered. 6 The letter from ASIC points out that if the company was re-registered it would return on ASIC's register to the status of External Administration. Clearly condition 2 above assumes that re-registration of the company would not automatically reinstate Mr Taylor as liquidator and therefore that it would be necessary to appoint a liquidator. 7 There are conflicting authorities as to whether a liquidator of a company who was in office at the time the company was de-registered is automatically reinstated to that office when the company is restored to the register. In Brownlie v TTPM Pty Ltd (2003) 21 ACLC 1204 , Hamilton J held that in such circumstances the liquidator was automatically reinstated and approved a statement to that effect made in A R Keay, McPherson: The Law of Company Liquidation 4 th ed, 1999 at 678; see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688 at 697."
Case10594,cited,Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; (1996) 186 CLR 71,"In the applicants' closing written submissions some generally uncontentious propositions about fiduciary duties were advanced. It was said that a fiduciary duty will arise where there has been an undertaking to act in the interests of another party together with the power to affect that interest in a practical sense and as a consequence of that power to affect the interests of the person to whom the duty is owed. Where the person is vulnerable and the power is abused breach of duty is established. Reliance was placed upon Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 96-97 (Mason J). The critical feature of a fiduciary relationship was said to be the reposing of trust or confidence in the fiduciary who undertook to act for, and on behalf of, and in the interests of, vulnerable persons in the exercise of a power or discretion which would affect the interests: Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; (1996) 186 CLR 71 at 82. The obligation of the party owing the fiduciary duty to act reasonably and in good faith was referred to. 585 In Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; 186 CLR 71, the High Court decided that a doctor owes a patient no general duty to provide access to the patient's medical records. The decision did involve a consideration of whether fiduciary obligations arose out of the doctor/patient relationship. Gummow J accepted that the mere presence of a contract does not exclude the coexistence of the concurrent fiduciary duties and that it may in particular circumstances provide the occasion for their existence. His Honour relied upon what was said by Mason J in Hospital Products Ltd [1984] HCA 64 ; 156 CLR 41. Gaudron and McHugh JJ cited Mason J and also, with approval, the statement of Sopinka JA in Norberg v Wynrib (1992) 92 DLR (4 th ) 449 at 481 (at 118): Fiduciary duties should not be superimposed on ... common law duties simply to improve the nature or extent of the remedy."
Case13231,applied,Ex parte Walton; re Levy (1881) 17 Ch D 746,"But like all deeming provisions, they have to be construed strictly and only for the purpose to which they are resorted: Ex parte Walton; re Levy (1881) 17 Ch D 746 per James LJ at 756; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Comber (1986) 10 FCR 88 at 96 per Fisher J. In other words, it does not operate to deem a person to have the control of money belonging to a non-resident save where the person is liable to pay money to that non-resident. So if a person [A] is liable to pay money to a non-resident [B], and B is liable to pay the same amount of money to another non-resident [C], A is not, by virtue of subs 255(2), deemed to have the control of money belonging to C.

Case3239,followed,Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27,"in Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27, the High Court revisited the question of late applications for amendment of pleadings, and the relevance to such applications of the powers and principles of case-management. The High Court reversed the order of the primary judge allowing the plaintiff to make substantial amendments to its claim at the start of the trial. At [92], Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ referred to the fact that case-management ""is now an accepted aspect of the system of civil justice administered by courts in Australia."" At [98], their Honours said with reference to the rule of Court conferring case-management powers on the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory: Of course, a just resolution of proceedings remains the paramount purpose of r 21; but what is a ""just resolution"" is to be understood in light of the purposes and objectives stated. Speed and efficiency, in the sense of minimum delay and expense, are seen as essential to a just resolution of proceedings. This should not detract from a proper opportunity being given to the parties to plead their case, but it suggests that limits may be placed upon re-pleading, when delay and cost are taken into account. The Rule's reference to the need to minimise costs implies that an order for costs may not always provide sufficient compensation and therefore achieve a just resolution. It cannot therefore be said that a just resolution requires that a party be permitted to raise any arguable case at any point in the proceedings, on payment of costs. At [111], their Honours concluded: An application for leave to amend a pleading should not be approached on the basis that a party is entitled to raise an arguable claim, subject to payment of costs by way of compensation. There is no such entitlement. All matters relevant to the exercise of the power to permit an amendment should be weighed. The fact of substantial delay and wasted costs, the concerns of case management, will assume importance on an application for leave to amend. Statements in JL Holdings which suggest only a limited application for case management do not rest upon a principle which has been carefully worked out in a significant succession of cases. On the contrary, the statements are not consonant with this Court's earlier recognition of the effects of delay, not only upon the parties to the proceedings in question, but upon the court and other litigants. Such statements should not be applied in the future. The present case is not one concerning a late application for amendment of pleadings. In many senses, it is more serious. It is a case of repeated refusals, not merely failures, to comply with orders of the court requiring the appellants to make discovery of documents and to allow Ms Wang's solicitor to inspect their discovered documents. Mr Lee had persisted with a demand for payment as a pre-condition for providing inspection of documents, despite advice from his own solicitor that this was not a course open to him. Even in the face of deadlines specified by the federal magistrate for the performance of obligations under earlier orders, Mr Lee proposed leisurely timetables for the performance of those obligations and a further adjournment of the trial, which had already been adjourned once. The circumstances in which the appellants had ceased to be represented by their solicitor were never revealed, making it more difficult for them to rely on lack of representation as a factor justifying the adjournment of the trial. It is significant that, despite the lack of representation and Mr Lee's difficulty with English, the two affidavits of 7 and 9 April demonstrated to the federal magistrate that Mr Lee had access to someone who was sufficiently fluent in English, and had sufficient understanding of the court processes, to produce affidavits in something close to the proper form. It would have been open to the federal magistrate to reach the conclusion that Mr Lee was attempting to postpone an inevitable judgment against the appellants on Ms Wang's claim, and that the need to visit his father in China was raised as part of such an attempt. The fact that the federal magistrate was kinder to Mr Lee than he needed to be, by not making such a finding, should not lead to a successful appeal from the exercise of the federal magistrate's discretion. If the powers given by rules of court to give judgment against a defaulting party were never to be exercised, because of a supposed principle that judgment for a large sum of money should not be given without a trial, the grants of express powers by rules would be hollow. Case-management would be deprived of its only real sanction against a party who, while resisting a claim for a substantial sum of money, defaults persistently in complying with orders of a Court. The framers of rr 13.03A and 13.03B of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules cannot have intended that those rules should be subject to such a principle that would enable a party against whom a substantial monetary claim is made to defend that claim by failing persistently to take steps necessary to bring the claim on for trial. Any principle derived from Freeman is much more limited than that suggested by counsel for the appellants. Freeman is best regarded as turning on its particular circumstances, and as belonging to an era before the broad adoption of case-management principles. As the recent judgment in Aon shows, case-management principles have assumed a greater importance than they were thought to have had, even as recently as 1997, when JL Holdings was decided. It is clear from the second passage I have quoted from Aon in [36] above that the principle stated in JL Holdings should no longer be followed. If there remains a narrower principle derived from Freeman than that suggested by counsel for the appellants, such a principle could not be applicable in the present case. There is no injustice in judgment for a large sum of money against Heng V and Mr Lee, having regard to Mr Lee's apparent determination not to comply with repeated orders requiring him to produce for inspection all of the appellants' discoverable documents.

Case16184,cited,John G Glass Real Estate Pty Ltd v Karawi Constructions Pty Ltd (1993) ATPR 41-249,"It is clear from considering this data in the context of preparing the 1 June 2004 Valuation Report that Mr Neubecker did not have detailed and exact information with respect to production. Rather, he presented what he perceived to be a careful estimate of expected yields for 2003/2004 as well as historical production figures for financial years (not Crop years as claimed by the applicants) based on the incomplete information before him which had been supplied by the first respondent. Similarly, by forwarding to Mr Tracy, as an interested potential purchaser, a copy of the 1 June 2004 Valuation Report with a view to providing an overview of the properties by an independent valuer, Mr Strahley and the first respondent were, at most, making a representation that the data in para 7.3 was a careful estimate of historical production figures and no higher. This did not somehow translate as claimed by the applicants into an unequivocal representation by either Mr Strahley or the first respondent that the data represented the unequivocally accurate position, which is the claim of the applicants. Given that the 1 June 2004 Valuation Report was provided by Mr Strahley (via Mr Douglas) to Mr Tracy, this is obviously not a case in that class where information is merely being passed on about property by an intermediary without any belief in its truth or falsity (cf John G Glass Real Estate Pty Ltd v Karawi Constructions Pty Ltd (1993) ATPR 41-249) However to say that a potential vendor's provision of a report by a valuer containing highly qualified estimates of production constitutes, without more, an unequivocal adoption and confirmation of those estimates as fact is simply incorrect in the circumstances of this case. 4.

Case14526,followed,Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 54 ; (1993) 179 CLR 101,"The claim by Bluescope and Castrip for an account of profits requires a determination of the profit derived by Mr Kelly and K.Con from any wrongful use or disclosure of the relevant information. The Court, in calculating the quantum of profit, must make such approximation as will do justice to the parties ( Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 54 ; (1993) 179 CLR 101 at 119). 162 K.Con received sums totalling $1,484,238.16 from Danieli. K.Con paid $333,802 to Messrs Sorensen, Minter, Russell, Zancolich and their respective companies and incurred travelling and other expenses of $41,934.37. Bluescope and Castrip assert that the net amount of $1,108,501.79 is the profit derived by Mr Kelly and K.Con from their wrongful use or disclosure of the relevant information. 163 While that calculation of profit makes an allowance for amounts paid to Messrs Sorensen, Minter, Russell, Zancolich and their companies and travelling and other expenses, it makes no other allowance for the cost of deriving the fees. Nor does it make allowance for information provided to Danieli that did not consist of confidential information relating to Project M. Danieli received information and assistance from K.Con, in exchange for the fees of $1,484,238, that was not confidential information belonging to Bluescope and Castrip. It is tolerably clear that Danieli also obtained benefit derived from Mr Kelly's wealth of experience in steel making over some 40 years. It would not have been possible for Mr Kelly or K.Con to disclose the specific information that has been identified except through an individual who has Mr Kelly's wealth of experience in steel making. 164 Bluescope and Castrip contend that, without the confidential information relating to Project M, neither Mr Kelly nor K.Con would have been retained by Danieli at all. They say that the whole arrangement involving the Consultancy Agreement between K.Con, on the one hand, and Danieli, on the other, came about only by reason of the wrongful use of the confidential information obtained by Mr Kelly from Bluescope. They say that Danieli only paid K.Con in exchange for receiving confidential Project M information. Had K.Con not been in a position to provide confidential Project M information, Danieli would have paid nothing at all. Accordingly, they say, the net amount represents profit obtained by K.Con from unlawful conduct (see Dart Industries at 119-120). 165 It may be that an inference can be drawn that Danieli was interested in entering into arrangements with Mr Kelly and K.Con because of Mr Kelly's involvement with Project M. However, it by no means follows that Danieli's object was to obtain confidential information relating to Project M, in breach of Mr Kelly's obligations of confidence to his employer. Bluescope and Castrip do not contend, and they have certainly not established, that all of the information imparted by Mr Kelly, either directly or through K.Con, to Danieli involved a breach of Mr Kelly's obligations of confidence. On the other hand, it is for Mr Kelly to demonstrate the extent to which any benefit he received in connection with any breach of duty is attributable to his own effort, expertise and know how beyond the mere disclosure of confidential information."
Case14914,cited,Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83,"To support its contention, Hoy refers to the decision in Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83, where Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed at 96 that in cases of implied waiver of legal professional privilege the question is whether fairness requires that the privilege should cease: see also Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 481 and 488 (per Gibbs CJ and Mason and Brennan JJ).

Case8428,referred to,Winpar Holdings Ltd v Austrim Nylex Ltd [2005] VSCA 211,"do not consider that an addition for the special value identified in the E&amp;Y Report is appropriate, having regard to the language of s 667C. As I have said, the first step requires the determination of the value, as at the date of the compulsory acquisition notice, of the Company as a whole, in the sense indicated above. It is impermissible, in determining fair value, to make any allowance for synergies to be achieved by the acquisition. It is equally impermissible in determining fair value to take into account special benefits deriving from full ownership (see Winpar Holdings Ltd v Austrim Nylex Ltd [2005] VSCA 211 at [35] ). I have taken some trouble to deal with Ernst &amp; Young's opinion in some detail since, for the reasons I have indicated, I consider that it adopts an inappropriate approach. However, neither defendant suggested that such an inappropriate approach invalidated the process. That is to say, they accepted that it is a matter for the Court, on the basis of the evidence before it, which was limited to the Expert's Report, to determine whether Regional has established that $2.50 per preference share gives shareholders a fair value for the preference shares. The defendants advanced arguments concerning the basis upon which the so-called special value should be allocated between ordinary shares and preference shares. The contention appears to be that Regional is a buyer of preference shares, and the present holders, apart from Regional, are sellers of preference shares. They suggested that it is necessary to allocate the special value of $1.4 million identified by Ernst &amp; Young between Regional, on the one hand, and preference share holders, who include Regional, on the other hand. Something in the order of half and half was suggested as appropriate. The contention appears to be that that exercise should be undertaken as part of the allocation of the value of the Company as a whole between the two classes of shares."

Many of these cases have involved claims for total and permanent disability benefits having criteria similar to those embodied in cl 1(6): see eg Jeffrey Guy Baker v Local Government Superannuation Scheme Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1173 ; Hay v Total Risk Management Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 94 ; Sayseng v Kellogg Superannuation Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 945 ; Flegeltaub v Telstra Super Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 107 ; Minehan v AGL Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd ; Vidovic v Email Superannuation Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Bryson J, 3 March 1995). 23 Accepting that both under the general law and under cl 3(1) of the trust deed, MMA Super had no duty to give reasons for its adverse determination, a failure to give reasons in circumstances where explanation might be called for is another matter. As Young J observed in Maciejewski v Telstra Super Pty Ltd (1998) 44 NSWLR 601 at 604, in dealing with the suggestion that because a trustee is not bound to give any reasons, therefore the matter is completely unreviewable: Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, whilst trustees do not have to give reasons in a case where a plaintiff puts forward a prima facie case that the trustee's discretion has miscarried, the absence of reasons and the absence of any evidence before the Court as to what happened, will tend to make that prima facie case a virtual certainty. This view has been endorsed in many subsequent cases: see Baker v Local Government Superannuation Scheme Pty Ltd ; Hay v Total Risk Management Pty Ltd ; Alcoa of Australia Retirement Plan Pty Ltd v Thompson (2002) 116 FCR 139 at [37]; Flegeltaub v Telstra Super Pty Ltd ; see also Butler LM, ""Reviewing Trustees' Decisions: The Right to Reasons"" (1999) 7 Aust Property LJ 251."
Case3471,cited,Rainsford v Victoria [2004] FMCA 707 ; (2004) 184 FLR 110,"The second proceeding was filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 8 November 2001 against both current respondents. It concerned the Charlotte Management Unit claim and was consolidated with the proceeding remitted from the Full Federal Court. The combined proceeding was heard before Bryant CFM in September 2003. In June 2004, before she had delivered judgment, the Chief Federal Magistrate was appointed Chief Justice of the Family Court. Regrettably, the matter had to be reheard before a different Federal Magistrate, Raphael FM. That hearing took place on 26 27 August 2004 and was, pursuant to a direction made by the Federal Magistrate, a hearing of certain separate questions.

Case1529,applied,Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1,"I do not consider that decision dictates that the decision of Lander J in the present matter was a final order so that no leave to appeal is necessary. That is because this proceeding, unlike the proceeding in Paramasivam , did not seek to enforce an existing alleged cause of action which had become statute barred by the elapse of time. In other words, there was no claimed legal right which Mr Ferdinands was seeking to enforce. His application was for an extension of time within which to apply for an order to show cause why the termination decision should not be set aside. It was necessary for him, even had he applied for such an order within time, to satisfy a Justice of the High Court (or if the matter were remitted to this Court, a judge of this Court) that it was appropriate for an order to show cause to be issued. Moreover, as McHugh ACJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ said in Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 at [4] : the usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order, as made, finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them. That question is answered by determining whether the legal effect of the judgment is final or not. If the legal effect of the judgment is final, it is a final order; otherwise, it is an interlocutory order. (original emphasis, citations omitted)"
Case1977,cited,Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48 ; (2000) 201 CLR 488,"a result of the failure of the negotiations I asked Mr De Kerloy to bring a motion for His Honour to disqualify himself and he again declined to act on such a motion. I was then required to engage another solicitor to bring this application. It is correct that, a very long time ago, I was briefed to appear as counsel for, I think, the then Commissioner for Corporate Affairs upon several complaints in the then Perth Court of Petty Sessions against Mr Carey. I am prepared to proceed on the footing that this occurred in or about 1980 as Mr Carey suggests. Mr Carey states that the charges concerned alleged insolvent trading. I will proceed on the basis that Mr Carey is broadly correct in his characterisation of the charges. My recollection, correct or not, is that Mr Carey was convicted on all counts but that these were quashed on appeal. At the commencement of the third day of the trial on 27 March 2008, I made disclosure in the following terms to the parties concerning an investment made by one of my brothers-in-law in a company in the Westpoint Group. HIS HONOUR: But before you call Mr Nairn, I need to inform the parties that during the course of the hearing yesterday something triggered a recollection of mine that one of my brothers-in-law was an investor in a company. I couldn't remember the name of it but I made inquiries last night and it was the company called York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd, which I think may have something to do with the Westpoint group. MR DE KERLOY: Yes. HIS HONOUR: Now, I don't consider that fact to be an impediment to my hearing this case. However, I felt it important to tell the parties of that fact. MR DE KERLOY: Yes, I would not take any issue with that, sir. Thank you for the disclosure. HIS HONOUR: Very well, thank you, Mr de Kerloy. Mr Slater? MR SLATER. We wouldn't take issue with that. HIS HONOUR: Very well. If you wish to call Mr Nairn, you can do so, Mr de Kerloy. I will proceed on the basis of Mr Carey's assertion that York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd is indeed a company ""associated with the Westpoint Group"" and that any person, including my brother-in-law, who invested in York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd has ""lost their money"". Lanepoint is concerned that Mr Carey's credibility had become an issue in the case in respect to the accounting treatment of loans recorded as having been made to the Westpoint Income Fund which the respondent contended were erroneous and which had been corrected. The test as to whether there is an apprehension of bias is whether ""a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide"": Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at [6] ; Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48 ; (2000) 201 CLR 488 at [11] ; Antoun v R [2006] HCA 2 ; (2006) 224 ALR 51 at [1] , [51], [82]; Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design &amp; Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55 ; (2006) 229 CLR 577 at [110] . The application of this principle requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. Second, there must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits: Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy at [8]; Smits v Roach [2006] HCA 36 ; (2006) 227 CLR 423 at [53] , [56]. The insolvent trading prosecution: Counsel for Lanepoint submits that in the course of acting in the prosecution it is to be expected that I would have been exposed to a range of issues or allegations concerning Mr Carey's conduct. This, he says, is an integral part of the process that those seeking to advance a case tell counsel a range of facts some of which will become admissible as evidence and be put before the court and others which may never see the light of day in that context, but nonetheless have the capacity to effect counsel's perception of the defendant."
Case8471,followed,Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234,"claiming that the alleged relinquishment and forfeiture of claims by the respondent did not constitute valid consideration the trustee relied in particular on the decision of the Full Court in Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 , in which case their Honours had in turn considered the earlier Full Court decision in Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217. The respondent claimed that her forbearance to sue and relinquishment of claims as pleaded in both the Amended Defence and the Cross-Claim constituted consideration in the circumstances of this case, and that accordingly those pleadings were not untenable as claimed by the trustee. Submissions of the trustee In summary Mr McQuade for the trustee submitted that: The claims in relation to the properties listed in para 10j of the Amended Defence, in respect of which the respondent alleges relinquishment and forfeiture of her claims and in respect of which the respondent also claims forfeiture of her claims to spousal maintenance, are inconsistent with the recitals and terms of the Financial Agreement (in particular Recital N and cl 6) and are therefore untenable. Recital K to the Financial Agreement stated that the agreement was entered into in substitution for any rights for spousal maintenance and property under Pt VIII of the Family Law Act . Whitlam and Jacobson JJ in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at [97] - [102] rejected the proposition that valuation of consideration in the form of a forbearance to sue could be undertaken by assessing the non-financial and financial contributions to the marriage as if an application had been made under s 79 of the Family Law Act . The respondent's pleaded case is underpinned by the allegation of assessment of the value of the consideration, namely the relinquishment of causes of action on the basis of the factors set out in paras 10a to 10d and 10f to 10(ia) of the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim. For the reasons set out in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217 and Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 that is untenable. Submissions of the respondent In summary, Mr Griffin QC for the respondent submitted that: The decision in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 does not support the proposition that forbearance to sue in matrimonial proceedings is of no commercial value and therefore not consideration within the meaning of s 120 of the Bankruptcy Act . Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 is distinguishable because in that case the parties made an informal agreement which did not prevent the wife from applying for relief under s 79 of the Family Law Act , whereas in this case: the parties signed a formal agreement recognised under the Family Law Act ; the respondent expressly relinquished and forfeited any claims and entitlements to property in Mr Jensen's name as well as an entitlement to spousal maintenance; the respondent has, by entering into the financial agreement and by virtue of s 71A of the Family Law Act , lost the right to apply for relief under s 72 and s 79 of the Family Law Act in relation to spousal maintenance and alteration of property interests. Insofar as the decision in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 related to the meaning of the phrase ""consideration of less than market value"" it was obiter because: the primary judge in Lopatinsky found that a forbearance to sue under s 79 of the Family Law Act was consideration within the meaning of s 120 of the Bankruptcy Act ; the Full Court found that there was no agreement to compromise Mrs Lopatinsky's claims and if there had been an implied forbearance to sue it was worthless because there were no consent orders entered under s 79 of the Family Law Act nor was the agreement approved under s 87 of the Family Law Act ; the trustee in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 accepted that an implied forbearance to sue can constitute good consideration. The appeal in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 was allowed because the agreement of Mrs Lopatinsky not to sue was found to be unenforceable and therefore was not valid consideration. The outcome would have been different had the agreement been binding and enforceable. In any event the whole issue of consideration and forbearance to sue are matters of judicial debate, and the pleadings ought not be struck out on an interlocutory application. Forbearance to sue and bankruptcy The concepts of forbearance to sue and consideration sit uneasily with circumstances where property interests are altered in a matrimonial context and one of the spouses becomes bankrupt. This issue was considered in detail by the Full Court in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234. It is useful at this point to turn to that decision. Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Lopatinsky A property was registered in the name of Mr and Mrs Lopatinsky as joint tenants. The property was sold. Approximately eighteen months after the settlement of the sale Mr Lopatinsky became bankrupt. It appears that the Lopatinskys had agreed informally that, on settlement of the sale of the property, Mrs Lopatinsky would receive $81,387 more than she would have been paid out of the net proceeds if those proceeds had been equally divided between them. Mr Lopatinksy's trustee in bankruptcy claimed that Mrs Lopatinsky gave no consideration for the transfer to her of the $81,387 or alternatively that she gave consideration which was less than the market value of the sum transferred to her, and that accordingly the payment of that sum was void pursuant to s 120 of the Bankruptcy Act . So far as relevant the trial judge found that: Mrs Lopatinsky gave consideration for the transfer of the $81,387 in the form of a forbearance to sue under s 79 of the Family Law Act for an adjustment of property rights to reflect her contribution to the acquisition of the property and to the welfare of the marriage; Mr Lopatinsky had agreed to this arrangement: because he was settling, in a general sense, with his wife following the failure of their marriage in relation to all the matrimonial property. It is to be recalled that the bankrupt told the applicant she could take whatever money was necessary to purchase something for her and the children to live in and that he believed she would be fair. I also infer from these remarks of the bankrupt, having regard to he context in which they were made, that his offer was in recognition of the applicant's contribution to the family and the property they jointly owned as well as her future needs in raising their children, and an acceptance that a fair distribution of that property would result in her receiving a disproportionately large sum of the proceedings. ( Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Lopatinsky (2002) 29 Fam LR 274 at 287 [43]) Accordingly the trial judge ordered that the relevant s 139ZQ notice be set aside. Before the Full Court the trustee contended that: The Full Court allowed the appeal against the decision of the primary judge. The majority judgment in the case was delivered by Whitlam and Jacobson JJ. Their Honours considered the earlier decision of the Full Court in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217 upon which the trial judge in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 relied, and in summary observed that: The trial judge in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 had found that there was implied in the settlement a forbearance on the part of Mrs Lopatinsky to make a claim against Mr Lopatinsky under the Family Law Act , and that an implied forbearance to sue constitutes good consideration. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 245-246) Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217 was not a case involving express or implied forbearance to sue rather consent orders had been made and entered pursuant to s 79 of the Family Law Act which provided for , inter alia, the transfer of the matrimonial home. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 244) All the members of the Full Court in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217 were of the view that where a consent order is made under s 79 of the Family Law Act the transfer of property takes place pursuant to the order of the Court. Accordingly, as a matter of construction of s 121 , there can be no ""transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt"". ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 246) The purpose of s 120 of the Bankruptcy Act is to prevent properties, including the matrimonial home, from being transferred to related parties to the disadvantage of the bankrupt's creditors. Disadvantage will occur if the property is transferred for no consideration or for less than market value. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 249) There is nothing in s 120(5) to suggest that Parliament intended that the term ""consideration"" in s 120(1)(b) is to be read in anything other than its legal sense. It would be inconsistent with the observations of Wilcox and Branson JJ in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217 to proceed upon the basis that ""consideration"" could be something less than the ordinary legal and commercial understanding of that term. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 249) In applying s 120(1)(b) the first step is to identify the consideration which was actually given. If consideration was given, the second step is to determine whether its value was less than the market value of the property transferred. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 249) As Wilcox J observed in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217 at [66] , the issue of the value of contributions is to be determined at a time when the marriage has come to an end and any contributions to the marriage were made in the past. Past consideration is, generally speaking, no consideration. The only significant exception to that rule arises where there is an earlier promise to pay (express or implied), an exception which is difficult to apply to matrimonial contributions unless for example there is a valid prenuptial agreement to that effect. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 247) The primary judge acknowledged that there was no express agreement between the Lopatinskys that Mrs Lopatinsky would not maintain proceedings for an adjustment of her property rights under the Family Law Act. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 250) The trustee accepted that an implied forbearance to sue can constitute good consideration. While the evidence of such a forbearance was slim, it was in any event unnecessary to decide whether the primary judge was correct in drawing the inference that Mrs Lopatinsky had so acted because the approach of the primary judge as to what constituted consideration and the value of it was contrary to the decision in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217. Their Honours continued: [Findings of the primary judge] indicate that his Honour endeavoured to value the ""consideration"" provided by Mrs Lopatinsky upon the basis of her financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage in accordance with the criteria referred to in s 79 of the Family Law Act . The short answer to this appeal is therefore that the primary judge's view of the value of the consideration given by Mrs Lopatinsky depended upon factors which cannot provide a basis for assessing the value of the consideration which was given. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 250) In any event, actual forbearance to sue does not constitute consideration unless it is evidence of an implied promise to forbear or unless it is given at the express or implied request of the other party. There was no evidence to support a finding that Mrs Lopatinsky promised to give up a claim under s 79 of the Family Law Act , in that there were no proceedings on foot in the Family Court and no mention by either party of the possibility of such a claim. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 250) Further, even if the informal agreement between Mr and Mrs Lopatinsky was supported by consideration in the form of an implied promise not to sue, it would not amount to a legally binding agreement for a compromise of Mrs Lopatinsky's entitlement to make a claim for a further property adjustment. ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 251) Findings 2. Second, even had such inconsistencies not existed between the terms of the financial agreement and the terms of para 10 and para 24 of the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim, I consider that the reliance by the respondent on her financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage as consideration for the transfer of the relevant properties is untenable. This is because the consideration pleaded by the respondent in para 10 and para 24 of the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim ""depended on factors which cannot provide a basis for assessing the value of the consideration which was given"" (Whitlam and Jacobson JJ in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 250). Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 is clear authority that previous financial and non-financial contributions to a marriage do not constitute ""consideration"" (within the meaning of s 120 or s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act ) for the transfer of property from a person who subsequently becomes bankrupt to his or her spouse. Specifically, paras 10a, 10b, 10c, 10d, 10f, 10g, 10h, 10i, 24a, 24b, 24c, 24d, 24g, 24h, 24i and 24j of the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim plead facts relevant to the circumstances of the marriage of the respondent and Mr Jensen and the financial and non-financial contributions they have each made. In my view: In light of these findings, I do not accept the respondent's submission that the facts pleaded in these paragraphs are directly relevant to support the respondent's allegation that the respondent provided consideration to Mr Jensen for the transfer, being either in the form of the consideration for the transfer of the relevant properties, or the consideration being in the form of the forbearance to sue for spousal maintenance and the respondent's abandonment of her interest in various specified assets. Accordingly these paragraphs in the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim are untenable. 3. Third, I do not accept the submission of the respondent that the decision in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 with respect to the meaning of the phrase ""consideration of less value than market value"" was obiter. The Full Court in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 accepted the general proposition that forbearance to sue could constitute good consideration, but found that the approach of the primary judge in endeavouring to ""value"" the alleged consideration provided by Mrs Lopatinsky upon the basis of Mrs Lopatinsky's financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage in accordance with the criteria referred to in the Family Law Act was incorrect (at [101]-[102]). In light of these clear findings I do not accept the submission by the respondent that Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 was distinguishable because no consent orders pursuant to s 79 of the Family Law Act had been entered in those proceedings. 4. Fourth, I do not accept the submission of the respondent that the decision in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 is distinguishable because in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 there was only an informal agreement whereby the wife had relinquished her entitlement to sue, whereas in this case the respondent and Mr Jensen had executed a financial agreement pursuant to the Family Law Act in which the respondent had expressly relinquished and forfeited any claims and entitlements to property in Mr Jensen's name as well as an entitlement to spousal maintenance. I take this view because: (a) Although one of the reasons for the decision of the Full Court in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 was that there was no evidence to support a finding that Mrs Lopatinsky had promised to give up a claim under s 79 of the Family Law Act , in fact the primary reason described by Whitlam and Jacobson JJ as ""the short answer to this appeal"" (at [101]-[102]) was the incorrect view the primary judge had taken of the alleged consideration provided in the circumstances of the case. (b) It is not in dispute that a binding financial agreement which is valid under the relevant provisions of Pt VIIIA of the Family Law Act has the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the court in respect of certain matters covered by the agreement, including financial matters or financial resources to which a binding financial agreement applies: Black &amp; Black [2008] FamCAFC 7 at [29] . However the simple fact of acknowledgment by one spouse in a financial agreement of the provision of consideration for the transfer of property does not mean that the alleged consideration is adequate for the purposes of s 120 and s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act if a transaction is subsequently challenged by a trustee in bankruptcy. As I noted earlier in this judgment, ""consideration"" in the context of the bankruptcy legislation has its ordinary legal and commercial meaning ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 249). The fact that the movement of consideration is acknowledged in a financial agreement does not give the consideration validity it would not otherwise have. (c) Further, and in any event, as I have already found in Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778 , the transfer of property pursuant to a financial agreement does not equate to a transfer of property pursuant to Court order, as was the case in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217. The current legislative framework applicable to financial agreements contemplates that a trustee in bankruptcy may make application pursuant to both s 120 and s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act to set aside a transfer pursuant to a financial agreement executed by the parties. Similarly, it is open to the Court to review the nature of the consideration stated in a financial agreement. The Court is not in any way prevented from doing so by the fact that the financial agreement is enforceable as between the parties under the Family Law Act. (b) Alleged payment by the respondent and her mother for the Carrara property, resulting in the transfer of that property to the respondent by Mr Jensen was merely a transfer of the bare legal title"
Case11479,distinguished,Baxter v Obacelo [2001] HCA 66 ; (2001) 205 CLR 635,"applicant claimed to derive assistance from Baxter v Obacelo [2001] HCA 66 ; (2001) 205 CLR 635. That case concerned s 5(1)(b) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW) which provided in part that: Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort ... (b) if more than one action is brought in respect of that damage by or on behalf of the person by whom it was suffered ... against tortfeasors liable in respect of the damage (whether as joint tortfeasors or otherwise) the sums recoverable under the judgments given in those actions by way of damages shall not in the aggregate exceed the amount of the damages awarded by the judgment first given ... The Court held that the provision applied only to cases where there was more than one proceeding, and thus did not preclude recovery against more than one defendant sued as joint tortfeasors in the one proceeding. Baxter [2001] HCA 66 ; 205 CLR 635 did not involve a limitation provision. I am unable to see how it assists the applicant. For the above reasons I am of the view that the Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration by this Court. If, contrary to my opinion, the Magistrate's order was a final order, I would dismiss the appeal for the same reasons I would refuse leave to appeal assuming the order to be interlocutory.

Case7297,cited,Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428 ,"notice to produce. The provision in the Federal Court Rules in relation to notices to produce is O 33 r 12. That rule provides: (1) Where a party to any proceedings serves on another party notice, in accordance with Form 45, requiring the party served to produce at any trial or hearing in the proceedings, or before any Judge, officer, examiner or other person having authority to take evidence in the proceedings any document or thing for the purpose of evidence and the document or thing is in the possession, custody or power of the party served, the party served shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, produce the document or thing in accordance with the notice, without the need for any subpoena for production. (2) Where the document or thing required to be produced in accordance with subrule (1) is not produced, the party serving the notice may lead secondary evidence of the contents or nature of the document or thing. (3) Subrule (2) does not affect the power of the Court to order costs against a party who fails to comply with a notice under subrule (1). Some principles have emerged in relation to notices to produce under O 33 r 12 from prior authorities. It is accepted that a notice to produce, properly issued in terms of O 33 r 12, has the same coercive effect as a subpoena. There is also authority that a notice to produce may be used even in respect of an interlocutory hearing. Though examples are to be found of such use it may perhaps require reconsideration at some stage in light of the remarks made in the Full Court in Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH v Owners of Ship ""Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya"" and Anor (1997) 79 FCR 71 at 93D (Bremerhaven), where the Full Court makes reference to adjectival rules to be applied at the hearing, being those appropriate to a final hearing. I proceed, though, on the basis that the desired use of a notice to produce by Mr Joyce to secure the production of particular documents for use in relation to the application to be heard on 14 December 2009 is, at least in theory, permissible under the Rules even though the application to be heard that day is not a final hearing. I note that in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428 , Hely J at 442, having voiced his general agreement with observations made by Hill J in relation to notices to produce, stated: Contestable issues of fact may arise in proceedings under O 15A for preliminary discovery."
Case4386,referred to,SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578,"detailed overview of authority discussing when leave should be granted for new grounds to be argued on appeal is to be found in the decision of Flick J in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] - [11] . The Court has had regard to those authorities, particularly the decision of Madgwick J in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [166] in which his Honour stated eight factors guiding the exercise of discretion to grant leave for an appellant to rely on new grounds of appeal. Those grounds were: Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success? Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below? How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved? What is at stake in the case for the appellant? Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand? Is there any actual prejudice, not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly, to the respondent? If so, can it justly and practicably be cured? If not, where, in all the circumstances, do the interests of justice lie? Overall, the leave will be granted where it is ' expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined ': see VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [26] .

Case9184,considered,Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374,"The Council, however, submitted that the economic evidence was admissible in order to provide context to the task of interpreting Part IIIA of the Act. It submitted that since Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1989) 67 CLR 77, the courts have approached the Act as an economic statute designed to address economic activity. It was submitted that, critically, the courts have understood that the character of the Act as an economic statute must be taken into account in construing the words of the Act and, in this regard, economic theory and writings may be considered: see Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374 (' Boral Besser ') at 454, [247] per McHugh J. Like the High Court, the Tribunal recognised the importance of economic concepts in the consideration and understanding of the purpose of Part IIIA: see Re Australian Union of Students (1997) 147 ALR 458 at 462-463. 172 In the process of my reasoning, reliance has been placed upon relevant legitimate extrinsic material (referred to by the parties), including the Hilmer Report. However, I have found helpful the discussion of the economic experts as to the nature and the context in which Part IIIA is to operate, although in this regard this has been no more than an elaboration of the relevant legitimate extrinsic material referred to me by the parties. I see nothing inappropriate in the court having regard to and admitting into evidence expert evidence to inform itself as to the nature of and the context in which Part IIIA is to operate, just as it would be appropriate for the court to consider any economic writings on the subject: see Boral Besser at 454, [247] per McHugh J. By admitting the expert evidence for this purpose, the material is presented in evidentiary form and all the parties know precisely the extent of the material that is before the court and that which is to be considered by the court."
Case12242,cited,Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537,"Martech submitted that it was entitled to the Termination Payment if the Agreement were terminated for any reason other than one of those set out in sub cls 8.1.1, 8.1.3, 8.1.4 and 8.1.5 or cl 8.5. Termination having occurred on 29 September 2000 for none of those reasons it says it was entitled. Energy submitted that, on its proper construction, cl 8.6 did not apply where Martech wished to terminate its services and agreed to termination. The benefit of the notice provision in cl 8.5 could be waived Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537 at 543, 552, 560 and 565. 166 The critical question in considering the Martech submission is whether, on the proper construction of cl 8.6, the entitlement which it creates in a case in which the 'Agreement is terminated for any other reason ...' arises where there is a consensual discharge of the Agreement. That constructional question depends upon a consideration of the words of cl 8.6 and the context in which they appear both within that clause and within other parts of cl 8 and the Agreement as a whole. 167 The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition of 'termination' is equivocal. It defines termination relevantly as a transitive verb meaning: 'bring to an end, put an end to, cause to cease; finish, end (an action, condition etc).' It is also defined as an intransitive verb meaning, inter alia: 'come to an end (in time); end, cease, conclude ...'"

His Lordship said (at 637): Now it is trite law that the persons who between them hold the entirety of the beneficial interests in any particular trust fund are as a body entitled to direct the trustees how that trust fund is to be dealt with, and this is obviously the legal territory from which that definition derives. Reference may also be made to Tomlinson (Inspector of Taxes) v Glyns Executor &amp; Trustees Co [1969] 1 All ER 700 at 704 and [1970] 1 All ER 381 at 383-384 (per Lord Denning MR), and Herdegen v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 84 ALR 271 at 281. In Herdegen , Gummow J distinguished between ""active"" and ""passive"" trusts, and said of a ""bare"" trust: Today the usually accepted meaning of ""bare"" trust is a trust under which the trustee or trustees hold property without any interest therein, other than that existing by reason of the office and the legal title as trustee, and without any duty or further duty to perform, except to convey it upon demand to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or as directed by them, for example, on sale to a third party.

Case24995,referred to,Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 440,"Minister submitted that there is no basis to suggest that the Tribunal did not apply a standard of balance of probabilities. The real complaint, according to the Minister, appears to be that the Tribunal had regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports when finding that the applicant failed the character test in s 501(6)(c). As the Tribunal found that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(a) any error in also finding that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(c) is irrelevant. In any case, there was no reason why the Tribunal could not have regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As it noted, they indicated similar behaviour to that for which the applicant had been convicted: [156]. According to the Minister, there is no error in the Tribunal's statement at [168] [169] that a substantial number of similar reports from a wide variety of different sources detailing similar conduct increases the probability that the overall picture is true. This is perfectly rational reasoning in the circumstances of this case. The weight to be attributed to particular evidence was a matter for the Tribunal: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41 per Mason J. Given the nature of the applicant's convictions there was no reason why the Tribunal could not also have regard to other evidence of similar behaviour by the applicant when considering s 501(6)(c). In the circumstances of this case the Tribunal was not finding criminal conduct in the absence of a conviction on 'slight material' (as cautioned against in Baker at 194C), it was finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character tests in s 501(6)(a) and (c) 'on the basis of the evidence': [169], which included the applicant's criminal convictions as well as the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As 'criminal conduct' and 'general conduct' are not a dichotomy and may overlap, the Minister submitted that it was perfectly appropriate for the Tribunal to consider both together: Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 440 at [33] [35]."
Case16701,referred to,Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd [1950] HCA 35 ; (1950) 81 CLR 418,"LCJ's words are taken from his judgment in Collins v Baltern (1767) 2 Wils 347 at 351. They reflect a principle which still runs through the common law of identifying fault as an appropriate basis for the court exercising its power to grant or withhold relief. In Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd [1950] HCA 35 ; (1950) 81 CLR 418 at 441, Latham CJ, Williams and Fullagar JJ discussed a contractual power to avoid a contract in circumstances where the consent of a third party, there the treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, had not been obtained within a particular time. They said that in that case, the event in question could be brought about by the failure on the part of either party to take certain necessary steps, or it could be brought about without default by either party. They concluded that the latter situation applied in that case, but determined that the clause made the contract not void, but voidable saying: ' The question of who may avoid it depends on what happens. If one party has by his default brought about the happening of the event, the other party alone has the option of avoiding the contract . If the event has happened without default on either side, then either party may avoid the contract. But neither need do so, and, if one party having a right to avoid it does not clearly exercise that right the other party may enforce the contract against him.' (emphasis added) Their Honours applied this reasoning as an extension of the principle that no party, directly or indirectly, may take advantage of his own wrong. In essence, Allphones' behaviour in relation to the payment of commission amounted to it evincing an intention not to take seriously its obligations to pay MTSC in accordance with cll 7.3 and 7.4 the franchise agreement. Its conduct was that of a person who evinced an intention that he was prepared to carry out his part of the contract if and only when it suited him and, in the way that it suited him. That was a repudiatory breach which continued over virtually the whole time in which Hoy Mobile was in breach: see Carr v JA Berriman Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 31 ; (1953) 89 CLR 327 at 351-352 per Fullagar J with whom the rest of the Court agreed. A party to a contract cannot act with impunity in a way which amounts to a refusal to be bound. Allphones concealed its underpayment of commission by a continuing deceit. Its action in doing that month after month, evinced an intention not to adhere to its promise to pay commission in accordance with the provisions of cll 7.3 and 7.4. This is not a case of a bona fide mistake in interpretation. No bona fide interpretation of a contract could justify Allphones' electronic manipulation of material data to disguise the true position. Here, Allphones' cumulative failures for over two years to account to Hoy Mobile for all of the commissions Hoy Mobile had earned from activations generated by its conduct of the franchise business, evinced an intention by Allphones not to be bound by the franchise agreement itself. Rather, Allphones evinced an intention to carry out that contract as and when it pleased. Mr Donnellan's evidence indicated that, as the chief executive officer, he saw it as open to Allphones to determine how and in what way it would perform its obligations in relation to the sharing of commissions. The evidence satisfies me that Allphones in fact did choose which commissions earned through activations of mobile telephone services generated by the sales of Hoy Mobile and other franchises would be shared. It did this regardless of the common understanding of Allphones and Hoy Mobile that cl 7 operated, as I have found, to cover all earnings of commissions from sales to customers in the stores of carriers' plan products, however the carriers paid those commissions (i.e. directly to the stores or to Allphones)."
Case22522,considered,Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509,"The judgment of the High Court in Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509 is often regarded as the leading Australian authority on abuse of process. The particular concept of abuse with which that judgment was concerned, however, was that of commencing and prosecuting proceedings for a purpose collateral to that for which the proceedings were designed: 174 CLR at 526-527. The Court was there concerned with the kind of case in which court proceedings are used as an instrument of oppression in the sense of seeking to achieve some collateral end rather than to vindicate the moving party's legitimate legal rights for which proceedings of the relevant kind were intended. A ready answer to the present problem is not provided by Williams v Spautz . It could not be suggested that the applicant had any purpose collateral to that achievable under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act in mind when the present proceeding was commenced. It is true that, as I have held, it was commenced as a separate proceeding because the more obvious expedient of seeking to amend the Victorian proceeding was unattractive. But on no view could it be asserted that the applicant is seeking to achieve some object extraneous to the rights and protections which it claims to have under the Trade Practices Act ."
Case863,cited,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v WAFJ [2004] FCAFC 5 (2004) 137 FCR 30,"In Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v WAFJ [2004] FCAFC 5 (2004) 137 FCR 30, the Full Court dealt with a case in which, on more than one occasion, the Refugee Review Tribunal had interrupted the evidence of an applicant for a protection visa, accused him of misbehaving, asserted that his evidence could not be believed, and treated him rudely and with sarcasm, to the point where he was likely to have become upset, confused and distressed, and to have been deflected from the presentation of his case. By majority, the Full Court upheld a judgment of a federal magistrate, setting aside the Refugee Review Tribunal's decision, by reason of denial of procedural fairness. In Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Maltsin [2005] FCAFC 118 (2005) 88 ALD 304, another Full Court dealt with the case of an applicant for a visa similar to that sought by Ms Antipova. In that case, similarly to this one, the Tribunal announced in the course of the hearing that it did not have sufficient time to hear all the evidence the applicant wished to give. The Tribunal also interrupted the applicant and prevented him from giving details in the course of his evidence. The Tribunal made repeated references to the need to hurry, and to the shortage of available time. It did not hear all the witnesses who had attended for the purpose of giving evidence on behalf of the applicant. The Full Court held that the resulting decision of the Tribunal was the result of jurisdictional error, which involved a denial of procedural fairness."
Case22208,cited,Bienstein v Attorney-General (Commonwealth of Australia) [2008] AATA 330,"Tribunal proceeded to deal with the two applications for review. In the course of managing them, the Tribunal made a further interlocutory decision on 23 April 2008, as to the directions to be given, declining to accept submissions of Ms Bienstein, who sought detailed directions to each respondent as to the nature of the searches that each should undertake. See Bienstein v Attorney-General (Commonwealth of Australia) [2008] AATA 330. On 5 May and 6 June 2008, the Tribunal conducted a hearing. On 13 June 2008, the Tribunal published its decision, affirming the decisions deemed to have been made by the Attorney-General and the Minister to refuse access to documents as requested by Ms Bienstein. The Tribunal found that each of the Attorney-General and the Minister had taken all reasonable steps to find documents meeting the terms of Ms Bienstein's requests. The Tribunal was satisfied that no documents, other than those that had already been found, existed. On 16 July 2008, Ms Bienstein filed a notice of appeal in this Court in respect of that decision. That appeal became proceeding number VID 563 of 2008. On 2 January 2009, Ms Bienstein filed an application for an order of review, pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (""the ADJR Act""), which became proceeding number VID 1 of 2009. Originally, Ms Bienstein named as respondents to that proceeding Malcolm Bennett, the FOI Director of the Attorney-General's Department, as well as the Attorney-General and the Minister. By consent on 3 February 2009, it was ordered that Mr Bennett be removed as a party to the proceeding. The object of the proceeding was to obtain an order that each of the Attorney-General and the Minister make a decision on Ms Bienstein's request for documents and provide Ms Bienstein with notice of the decision. On 28 January 2009, the Attorney-General and the Minister filed a notice of objection to the competency of that proceeding, contending that the application was filed outside the time limits set out in s 11(3) and (4) of the ADJR Act, and that the Attorney-General and the Minister were not under any duty, and did not have any power, to make decisions under the FOI Act, and consequently there was no failure to make decisions they had a duty to make, within s 7 of the ADJR Act. Proceedings numbers VID 563 of 2008 and VID 1 of 2009 were heard together. The legislation Section 11 of the FOI Act provides: (1) Subject to this Act, every person has a legally enforceable right to obtain access in accordance with this Act to: (a) a document of an agency, other than an exempt document; or (b) an official document of a Minister, other than an exempt document. (2) Subject to this Act, a person's right of access is not affected by: (a) any reasons the person gives for seeking access; or (b) the agency's or Minister's belief as to what are his or her reasons for seeking access."

Thus, s 2 of the Act states: ""The object of this Act is to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provisions of consumer protection."" Their Honours explained the principles of assessment of loss under s 82 as follows ( Allianz 221 CLR at 597-598 [100]): "" [100] In I &amp; L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at 119 [26] ), Gleeson CJ said of the construction of s 82: 'When a court assesses an amount of loss or damage for the purpose of making an order under s 82 , it is not merely engaged in the factual, or historical, exercise of explaining, and calculating the financial consequences of, a sequence of events, of which the contravention forms part. It is attributing legal responsibility; blame. This is not done in a conceptual vacuum. It is done in order to give effect to a statute with a discernible purpose; and that purpose provides a guide as to the requirements of justice and equity in the case. Those requirements are not determined by a visceral response on the part of the judge assessing damages, but by the judge's concept of principle and of the statutory purpose.' The upshot in I &amp; L Securities was the holding stated by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ ( I &amp; L Securities [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at 128 [57] (footnotes omitted)). (See also at 121-122 [33], per Gleeson CJ; at 132 [69] per McHugh J.): '[T]he question presented by s 82 of [the TP Act] is not what was the (sole) cause of the loss or damage which has allegedly been sustained. It is enough to demonstrate that contravention of a relevant provision of [that] Act was a cause of the loss or damage sustained.' (Original emphasis.)"" A large number of apartments in the resort were sold after Mustara collapsed. Some were comparable with Ms Tan-Bounkeua's apartment. The pattern that emerged after Mustara's collapse until about mid 2004 was that market prices realised for apartments in the resort were generally greater than the purchase prices. In about mid 2004 they became similar. However, considerable difficulty was experienced in achieving sales of quite a number of units, including Mr Owers'. And, the number of properties which had been listed for sale, but not sold, had increased markedly since the turn of the market in mid 2004. By mid 2005 the market had turned down and almost all the properties in the resort were sold at a price less, and sometimes up to about 25% less, than their acquisition cost. Mr Dupont noted that the more recent sales results were in marked contrast to movements in median sale prices of apartments in Wyong Shire during the period between 2000 and 2007. He said that, although sale prices in the resort were slightly erratic, there was a general weighting indicating an increase in value of apartments in the resort of around 40%-50% from 2000 to the peak of the market in 2004. In comparison, median values of ordinary residential units (without a restriction on use similar to that affecting the resort) in Wyong Shire increased by 84% in the same period. He said that the reduction in values in recent years was partly a result of over supply in The Entrance unit market, as well as a general softening of the property market due to interest rate rises, affordability and macro economic conditions."
Case18680,cited,O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners (1982) 153 CLR 1,"first is whether Mr Ingham was hindered or obstructed by the Union officials (that is, a permit holder) on 13 February 2009 or 5 March 2009 as a question of fact ( Pine v Doyle ; Standen v Feehan ; O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners (1982) 153 CLR 1). The second is whether the officials engaged in that conduct intentionally. The third is whether the conduct of the officials offended the prohibition upon a permit holder otherwise acting in ""an improper manner"" and whether that conduct must be engaged in intentionally. There is no doubt that Mr Ingham on both days was diverted from discharging his normal duties. He was called to the entry gate and was compelled to deal with the events of entry that the officials knew was the subject of John Holland's objections. He also sought to manage the events of entry by discouraging the officials from continuing to enter the site as they walked along the road towards the smoko or crib huts and by engaging the officials and requesting and/or ordering them to leave the site. Mr Ingham chose to wait with the officials until the employees had their break and chose to be present when the officials spoke to employees in the huts. His election to wait and be present was a function of managing the consequences of unauthorised entry."
Case21545,cited,Hill v Green [1999] NSWCA 477 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 161,"In considering the approach to be taken by the Court to the Decision of the ABA, the Court must be satisfied that the ABA's Reasons considered the relevant factual matters required by s 84(2) of the Act, and that the ABA did not take into account irrelevant considerations. The Court must also be satisfied that the power provided to the ABA has been exercised reasonably: see Kruger and Others v Commonwealth of Australia [1997] HCA 27 ; (1997) 190 CLR 1 at 36 per Brennan CJ. The process adopted by the ABA in its application of s 84(2) must be logical. In Hill v Green [1999] NSWCA 477 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 161, Spigelman CJ said (at 174-175): 'In my opinion, where a statute or regulation makes provision for an administrative decision in terminology which does not confer an unfettered discretion on the decision-maker, the court should approach the construction of the statute or regulation with the presumption that the Parliament or the author of the regulation intended the decision-maker to reach a decision by a process of logical reasoning and a contrary interpretation would require clear and unambiguous words.'

That is, where the Tribunal has made an error of law, but the error is immaterial, its decision will not be set aside for that reason: Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 235 ; (1999) 90 FCR 274 at [53] . Reliance was placed on what was said by Lockhart and Hill JJ in BTR Plc v Westinghouse Brake and Signal Co (Australia) Ltd (1992) 26 ALD 1 at 7 that: '[I]t will not be enough for an applicant to demonstrate that the Tribunal mis-stated the law in the course of its reasons, if that mis-statement could not have affected its decision. The task of the court on an appeal under s 44(1) is essentially to undertake judicial review of the tribunal's decision. An immaterial error of law will not vitiate the decision of the tribunal ...'"
Case15142,cited,Barghouthi v ING Custodians Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1272,"I also accept that, as the respondent submitted, the Court may make the orders that it seeks by way of its motion. In McGregor v Chief Executive Officer of Centrelink [2000] FCA 701 at [17] , Spender J expressed the view that there was power under O 20 r 2 of the Rules to dismiss an appeal purportedly under s 44 of the AAT Act on the basis that it stated no question of law and thus disclosed no reasonable cause of action: see also Zoia v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2003] FCA 303 at [6] per Carr J and Barghouthi v ING Custodians Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1272 at [15] per Allsop J. In Lambroglou , Ryan J expressed the view (at 519) that O 53 r 15(1) of the Rules conferred a power sufficiently broad to allow the Court to strike out the whole or part of an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act. Whatever the correct analysis of the Rules, s 23 of the Federal Court Act confers broad power on the Court to make orders of such kinds as it thinks appropriate. I accept that, pursuant to s 23, the Court has power to strike out a notice of appeal in reliance on s 44 where the notice does not state a question of law: compare also Lambroglou at 519-520."
Case136,referred to,One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548,"The ACCC submitted that the principles governing the award of costs in cases where a matter does not proceed to a final hearing were correctly expounded by Burchett J in One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548 at 553: ""In my opinion, it is important to draw a distinction between cases in which one party, after litigating for some time, effectively surrenders to the other, and cases where some supervening event or settlement so removes or modifies the subject of the dispute that, although it could not be said that one side has simply won, no issue remains between the parties except that of costs. In the former type of case, there will commonly be lacking any basis for an exercise of the Court's discretion otherwise than by an award of costs to the successful party. It is the latter type of case which more often creates problems, since there may be difficulty in discerning a clear reason why one party, rather than the other, should bear the costs. "" 15 The ACCC contended that the present case fell within the first category described by Burchett J. Although in Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J made no mention of One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation , her Honour's discussion at [48]-[59], under the heading ""Futility"", deals helpfully with the second category of cases that his Honour identified. 32 In my view, this case falls squarely within the first category of case articulated by Burchett J in One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation . The appropriate order is that the second respondent pay the applicant's costs, any such costs to be taxed in default of agreement. I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg. Associate: Dated: 11 April 2006 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr J.P. Moore Solicitors for the Applicant: Deacons Counsel for the Second Respondent Mr D.L.

Case24404,referred to,VHAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 559 ,"further element of the case for denial of natural justice advanced by the appellants against the Minister in the Federal Magistrates Court below related to the use made beforehand by the Tribunal of the country information upon which it purportedly relied relevantly to its decision-making. The complaints made in that regard, as Nicholls FM recorded in the course of his reasons for decision, were that the Tribunal did not give to the appellants the country information on which it relied, and further that the Tribunal did not extend to the appellants an opportunity to evaluate or make submissions otherwise concerning the use of that information. By reason of those omissions of the Tribunal complained of, the appellants asserted denial of natural justice. His Honour observed that the appellants' application for review of the Tribunal decision predated the enactment of s 422B of the Migration Act headed 'Exhaustive statement of natural justice hearing rule' , with the consequence that '[t]he common law rules of procedural fairness are not excluded from applying in the case before me' . Nevertheless as his Honour proceeded to record, '... there is no general proposition that the failure to put adverse country information to an applicant, on its own, amounts to a breach of natural justice' , citing thereby the Full Federal Court's decision in VHAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 559 at [17] (Gyles and Conti JJ) and [27]-[28] (Allsop J)."
Case13822,cited,Ex parte Selby; in the matter of Selby and Norton (1855) 43 ER 1427,"The public and private importance of the change of status in making a party bankrupt is too well known to require detailed citation. It is not a matter merely between debtor and creditor. It affects creditors generally and the public. The bankrupt, while bankrupt, has his or her status changed. Conduct which might otherwise be innocent may become punishable at law. There remains a stigma to the person, often as a mark of failure in life, sometimes of a particularly humiliating character. Though in a dissenting judgment, the seriousness of the matter was luminously expressed by Deane J in Kleinwort Benson Australia Pty Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1999) 165 CLR 71 at 82. The public and private interest in discharge or annulment can be seen in many cases such as Re Barton (1980) 43 FLR 245, Re Stainton; Ex parte Board of Trade (1887) 19 QBD 182, Re Haines (1937) 10 ABC 83, Re Gray (1960) 19 ABC 29 and Re Prince (1961) 19 ABC 39 and see also Ex parte Selby; in the matter of Selby and Norton (1855) 43 ER 1437 per Lord Justice Knight-Bruce."
